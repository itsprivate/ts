The only time that they've lost the majority during that time period was 80th congress (1947-1949), 83rd (1953-1955) during Harry Truman's presidency. Even when assuming house election favors the opposition party, they didn't lose majority during the LBJ's presidency, and Carter's presidency so my questions are\n\n1) How were they able to retain majority for such a long time\n\n2) How did the Republican presidents such as Ronald Regan, Richard Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower able to push their agenda despite not having house approval? Were there a lot of bipartisan bills introduced during that time period?",
