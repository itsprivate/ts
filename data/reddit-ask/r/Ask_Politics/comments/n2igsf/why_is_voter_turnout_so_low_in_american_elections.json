The thing I find odd is that in most other democracies, turnout numbers like that are seen as normal, not exceptional. For example, in the UK turnout on average higher than the American 2020 election, and was regularly above 70% in the late 20th century.\n\nIn my country, India, 60% turnout happens about every election, and is usually higher. For example, we recently had elections for Chief Minister (governor equivalent) in 4 states and 1 union territory. The lowest turnout value was 74%, and it went above 80% in most of them. Here, turnout is high because a  majority of voters rely on government schemes and welfare, which motivates voting, but again American turnout lags behind most democracies, even other well-off ones (Germany, Italy etc.).",
