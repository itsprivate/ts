We still barely afford apartments - can't afford homes. We have trouble deciding on food because of high prices. We don't even have to worry about paying healthcare bills and yet we still barely sneak by.\n\nAre we really fighting for the best thing when we try to raise the minimum wage? I'm not exactly arguing for no minimum wage - I'm just starting to wonder if this giant political battle in the United States is even worth it. Considering we won it up here, it simply lets us keep our head above water a tiny bit more efficiently.\n\nIs it that we need a higher minimum as well as other worker benefits? Is it that we need basic income (which I received during the Ontario trial)? Is it that we need to make higher skilled jobs that have higher pay easier to obtain? Is it that post-secondary education needs to have less interest groups influencing program prices? I assume it's not a \"one solution fixes all\" type of situation. I'd really like to learn from everyone here.\n\nTLDR: Have we gotten hyper-fixated on minimum wage increases when it ultimately won't solve our problems? Even if we raise minimum wage yearly based on inflation wouldn't it still kind of keep us in poverty? Coming from someone who lives in an area with a 15$ minimum wage.",
