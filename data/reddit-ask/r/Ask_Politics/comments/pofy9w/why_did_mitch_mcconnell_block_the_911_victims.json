Most of the media portrays McConnell as just being an evil old career politician, an the explanations I see on (generally left-leaning) social media essentially explain this by saying he&#39;s evil, or that the Republicans block it for no other reason than the Democrats want it. It makes for emotive and entertaining reading but obviously this isn&#39;t accurate and doesn&#39;t explain what really happened.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: what is a more accurate and nuanced explanation of what happened with the bill?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
