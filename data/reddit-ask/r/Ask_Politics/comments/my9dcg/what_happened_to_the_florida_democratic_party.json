The 2018 midterm was a fantastic year for Democrats with them winning the house by a large margin and taking a slew of state legislature. However Florida defied the trend. Ron DeSantis managed to edge out Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial race and Rick Scott beat a popular incumbent senator. They also picked up state seats. In 2020 the trend continued, with Trump winning the state, the Republicans winning state seats, and even flipping two house seats in south Florida. Trump came somewhat close to even winning Miami, a Democratic stronghold.\n\nThis raises the question, what happened to the Florida Democratic party? 2018 should have been a fantastic year for them, and they should of held their own in 2020.",
