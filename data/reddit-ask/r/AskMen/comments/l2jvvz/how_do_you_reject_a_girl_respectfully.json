I was with a few guy friends buying snacks and this girl just came and out of 5 boys, she initiated the conversation with me and I thought she was just being friendly but then she asked my number and I was like, \"OH. SORRY OH BUT OH I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND OH\" It was so awkward and I don't think she will ever ask a guy out. What should I have done?\n\nEdit: Oh god this blew up 😂 I took your responses and if ever I get asked out again by a girl, I will use those. Also, thanks for those awards ❤\n\n\nEdit: I was so proud of myself for getting asked out that my girlfriend compared me to the cat in the proud-cat-with-waffle meme. 😌",
