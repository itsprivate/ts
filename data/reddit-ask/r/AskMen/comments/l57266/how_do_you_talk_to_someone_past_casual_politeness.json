Years ago I told myself I would wait until I was emotionally, mentally and financially mature enough due to seeing how dramatic high school relationships were. \n\nSo I’ll sometimes find myself talking with a girl or two at work or on occasion one of my sister’s friends. I have this very stupid, chronic thought process when it comes to mind with women about what it’d be like to date them. We’ll engage in some light small talk about how our days are but that’s pretty much it. I’m a massive moron when it comes to conversation, even with family I’ve known for years. Beyond the basic, “how are you?”, “having a good day?”, and other such formalities I have trouble really just talking about anything. I’ve no clue what to ask, say or bring up at any time. \n\nI’d love to just let loose and feel more casual around a girl, be able to joke and have some little rapport, rather than just treating them like a stranger every time. I’ll essentially just give little polite responses when they start talking about something. “Oh yeah? That’s pretty cool!” “You did? That’s great!” “Aw I’m sorry to hear that.” “That sounds like a good idea.” \n\nThese and other such phrases seem to be the majority of what I contribute to conversations. I don’t know how to question them in order to learn more about them. I’ll sometimes try “you go to school?”, only to realize I know nothing about college so I don’t know what sort of specific questions to ask because it’ll all go over my head and I’ll just be sitting there nodding along, trying not to seem rude. \n\nI’m often left thinking: am I really interested in a woman? Or just the idea of one? Or maybe I’m subconsciously an asshole and just find them pretty to look at? I don’t even know what I want anymore, I...I have no clue why I’m pursuing something like this, I know it’ll end in futility. \n\nJust thought I’d ask if y’all had any similar issues with this, or what you might recommend.
