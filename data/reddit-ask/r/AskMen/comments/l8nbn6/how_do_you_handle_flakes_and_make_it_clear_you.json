  "selftext": "I met this girl through mutual friends last year. We started texting a few months ago, hung out about 4 weeks ago, and I asked her on an official date about 3 weeks ago. After talking she agreed to dinner so we made some plans. \n\nAt 5am the day were suppose get dinner she sends me a text that her \"mom, sister, and grandma just tested positive for covid and she's not feeling well.\" She asked to hold-off until she could get tested. Fine.\n\nA few days pass and she messages me that she \"doesn't have the rona!\" but my week was pretty booked at this point so I told her that. She said she was leaving town for the weekend and would be back Sunday. The vibes I was getting is that she's not interested so instead of trying to force something on the schedule I just said \"okay have fun!\"\n\nA few more days pass and she messages me \"Hey! I'm not going out of town now this weekend because of the storm. Lunch on Sunday?\"\n\nI agree. \n\nSunday morning I text her \"Hey! We still on for today?\" She responds \"Most likely! I'm super hungover and xyz came up that I have to do. Late lunch/early dinner?\"\n\nI agree.\n\nAn hour later she texts me \"Hey, I just barfed and I don't want to keep you waiting. Want to just reschedule?\"\n\nIf I'm being honest I am a little pissed at this point. I'm self employeed and busy and I've now blocked my calendar off for her TWICE with her rescheduling the day of, preventing me from really filling in that time with anything else. Specifically on this last one, I had an offer to leave town for the weekend which I declined because it came after she already asked me to lunch on Sunday. \n\nI was pretty blunt in my response and just told her \"I don't want you puking on me so we can reschedule but, I'm not going to tolerate another reschedule on the next one, okay?\"\n\nShe responded a day later, I put the ball back in her court, and haven't heard from her in 4 days now. \n\nI realize I was probably a little blunt/aggressive in my response but I honestly have no time for this shit. \n\nHow do you guys normally handle a situation like this? I'm trying to have a little more tact going forward. \n\nThanks",
