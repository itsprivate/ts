Do you take it off?\n\n-\tIf you keep the condom on, do you just cuddle with that rubber, cum-filled bag on your dick? That seems pretty gross to cuddle in\n\n-\tIf you take it off, do you make a joke about it while the girl lays in bed looking at you?\n\n-\tIf you take it off, where do you put it? Is there a trash can in your room or do you have to run to the bathroom with it?\n\n-\tDo you keep tissues in your room for that sort of thing?\n\n-\tDon’t your hands smell like latex now? Do you go wash them?\n\n-\tIf I don’t go wash them, you still have pussy juices and cum and lube and latex on your hands—isn’t that annoying when you smear it all over your phone screen?\n\n-\tWhat about the girl? If she wants to stay and cuddle, doesn’t she need to clean up?\n\n-\tWhat things does the girl need? Do I need to give her tissues?\n\n-\tDon’t tissues fall apart and get fuzzies all over your hands? Would a towel be better? Wet wipes maybe?\n\n-\tFor that reason, should there be a trash can on both sides of the bed, so she doesn’t have to hand me her gross tissues/wipes?\n\n-\tCan I go to the bathroom and wash up? (In another thread, a dude said doing this gives the impression to the girl that sex with her “was disgusting.”)\n\n-\tWhat about dribbling out cum in bed?\n\n-\tDo you keep a spare towel between you? Where do you put this towel beforehand?\n\nI’m serious about all of this. Everyone likes to act like they know what they’re doing, but what are you supposed to do during the awkward moments immediately after sex?\n\nEdit: thanks for nothing",
