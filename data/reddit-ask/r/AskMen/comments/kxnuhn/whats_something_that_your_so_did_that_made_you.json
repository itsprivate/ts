I was going through a rough time after a girl I loved led me on for ages and lied to me before getting with someone else and rubbing it in my face, so this was the first time I felt happy just watching her dance. She pulled me onto the dance floor with her when the next song began and my heart fucking just skipped a beat and it was so weird because she was my childhood friend since forever and I didn't think I'd see her that way but I did and now we're married and we have a beautiful new baby and I'm so happy",
