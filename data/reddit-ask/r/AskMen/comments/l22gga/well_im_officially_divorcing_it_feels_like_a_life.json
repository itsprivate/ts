I feel a pretty large weight lifting off of me, as I’ve been on the back burner for a very long time.  I’m trying to treat this like a complete life reset.  Getting girls isn’t a problem for me, at least it hasn’t been during the separation phase, I imagine it’ll be even easier once I have no baggage.  But what are some things or adventures you’d dream of going on or doing?  I’m pretty wide open and willing to try anything right now!  I think for once in my life I’m going to live for exclusively me for a bit.  Maybe disappear into the woods for a month haha.\n\nThanks!",
