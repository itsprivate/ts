Papers get signed tomorrow.  I’m 29, great job, good health, cute pup, and I’ll have some income with the sale of our house.  I feel a pretty large weight lifting off of me, as I’ve been on the back burner for a very long time.  I’m trying to treat this like a complete life reset.  Meeting women isn’t a problem for me, at least it hasn’t been during the separation phase, I imagine it’ll be even easier once I have no baggage.  But what are some things or adventures you’d dream of going on or doing?  I’m pretty wide open and willing to try anything right now!  I think for once in my life I’m going to live for exclusively me for a bit.  Maybe disappear into the woods for a month haha.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit addition: Ok, I feel like I need to clarify here on the getting girls comment.  (Which I changed girls to women since people have a problem with that) Honestly.. my self worth did diminish a ton over this.  The back story being.. my wife determined she’s gay.  All of the counseling, separations, talks, back and fourths, boundary pushing, hurtful conversations and behaviors really gets to you over the course of a 1 1/2 year stint.  On one hand, it’s great she figured it out for herself.  But it’s really left me feeling pretty inadequate and honestly ugly in many ways through this process.  Especially in the ways she handled it.  The pain of feeling not enough really stinks. Never mind the distance and lack of intimacy all while she begged to go out and be intimate with others.  When I downloaded apps to see, or just started asking for numbers during the separation, it really perked me up and made me realize that maybe I am desirable after all and worthy of someone who clicks with me on my level and can be compatible when I’m ready.  I felt very imprisoned in this.  I’m sorry I came off as a pompous ass.  I do have needs, I do want to mingle around.  But ultimately, I want to work on me, continue to grow be it mentally, and physically in the gym, and go on many adventures!  \n\nI will say this experience has shown me what questions to ask and things to work on when I am ready for something serious.  I’m 💯 in therapy and have been since the beginning of this process.  I also just had all my wisdom teeth pulled two hours ago and am handling all of this solo.  Because I’m a independent man, damnit.  I appreciate all of the thoughtful messages, and comments.  This is .. still tough and it comes in waves of highs and lows.  I ultimately just want to make lemonade from lemons and create the best life for me now.   Much brotherly love to all of you!",
