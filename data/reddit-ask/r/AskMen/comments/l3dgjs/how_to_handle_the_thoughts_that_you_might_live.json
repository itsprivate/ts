When I  say for a long time, I never had someone at all. So instead, I put the  time spent browsing dating apps and checking dating advice into doing  something good for other people, I thought that if I couldn't find  someone to share life with, at least I could make a stranger's life  better.\n\nNow I'm working with  disabled kids/adults and it's pretty damn great. I volunteer for the  homeless too and, again, I really like it.\n\nBut when I see friends longing for a SO or listen to radio songs, I just  have to wonder how it feels to be wanted, and how this life is going to  end. I don't know the future, but with my streak I'd like to have a  correct life even if it's spent alone. And so far, I think I managed  that.\n\nTo be honest, I'm really  scared for when I will be older. I'm fit and healthy now, but as I age  that's going to change. I  don't want to be the old guy all alone at the end of a retirement home that never has any visit and looks out of the window hoping for a meteor crash. I don't want a SO just to have her take care of me mind you, it's just that growing old together sounds better than alone.\n\nSo, guys that dealt with similar thoughts, how did you handle it?",
