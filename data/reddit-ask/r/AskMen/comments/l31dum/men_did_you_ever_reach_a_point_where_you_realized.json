I used to seek out arm candy and now I don't even bother. What I realized matters is in the heart... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's mostly on the inside of us, in our brains and hearts. Pussy has grown to possess no value to me whatsoever.\n\nI actually enjoy friendships with women in my life. I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter.\n\nSex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance.\n\nSo now I am 25 and see that I am a man I would never thought I'd be. Still kinda horny, but with a different perspective.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if anybody can relate.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards. Lots of great replies and some judgemental ones too.
