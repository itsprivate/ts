Without further delay:\n\n# Thersday\n\nYou suggested and we listened: you wanted a day free of motherhood, parenting, pregnancy, and similar related posts! In response, we expanded our theme day, Thersday, to limit posts only to women themselves, outside of any relationships with other people. It was initially implemented as a trial, and we are happy to announce that due to good feedback, this change is here to stay. We’re pleased with the creativity and variety of topics posted as a result of theme days, and as far as we can tell, so are you!\n\n# An important clarification regarding our rule against disrespectful commentary\n\nAt AskWomen, we strive to be an inclusive space. Statistically, approximately 1 in 5 adults will experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime. As we grow as a subreddit, we want to maintain a space where we can both include and be understanding of one another. As such, we are expanding this policy to now include pathologizing language/armchair diagnosing. We feel that, whether intentional or not, casual use of diagnostic labels to describe everyday behaviour can exclude and be harmful to people experiencing mental illness.\n\nIt is not fair to people with mental illness to attribute every feeling or action to their condition, particularly the choice to abuse. Plenty of people living with mental illnesses are capable of living a life free of abusing others, just as some abusers who have no known psychiatric conditions make the conscious choice to abuse, every day.\n\nIn short, we are asking our community to **avoid using terms for mental health issues as judgments, slurs, or synonyms for toxic behaviour.** Posts and comments will be encouraged, where possible, to use non-pathologizing/clinical adjectives to describe traits/behaviours.\n\n# Examples of using these terms as judgements, slurs, or careless casual use\n\n**Usage of words/labels like:**\n\n* “OCD” (to mean something like fastidious, particular, picky, fussy)\n* “narcissist” (to mean something like self-absorbed, arrogant, toxic, selfish, abusive)\n* “borderline/BPD” (to mean something like unstable, unpredictable, moody)\n* \"schizo’’ (to mean something like paranoid, erratic, or eccentric)\n* “ADHD” (to mean something like hyperactive, jittery, inattentive)\n* “psycho(path)’’ or \"sociopath’’ (to mean something like angry, jealous, controlling, abusive...) and similar.\n\nIf a diagnostic label can be replaced by another word, it must be used instead. In our experience, the more common synonyms might be \"abuser’’/’’abusive’’, \"toxic (of a behaviour or person)’’, or \"asshole’’. You always have your pick of non-gendered slurs and insults, too!\n\n**Armchair diagnostics or speculation about possible diagnoses:**\n\n* **‘**’That sounds like x’’,\n* \"I think my ex was y\"\n* ‘’I think my mom has/is z’’\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n* Talking about your own, diagnosed condition and how it affects you\n* Talking about your family member, friend, or other person with a diagnosed condition, and how it affects you, in a submission in which you are the requested demographic (eg. addressed to friends/family members of people with x, not people with x).\n* Talking about yourself/someone in your life who is seeking a diagnosis, but does not have one yet (eg - \"my friend is starting the process of getting tested for ADHD\")\n* Talking about famous people and figures who have the diagnosis, if it is relevant\n\nApplication of these rules is at moderator discretion. We may remove other common labels or descriptors (for instance \"crazy\") if mods feel that they were used in a blatantly disrespectful manner. Please[ send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskwomenmods) if you would like to discuss a removed comment or post.\n\nWe know that the use of some of these labels is very common on Reddit, so it's natural that some of these terms might be used by accident. Please know that a request to edit your post does not mean that you are in trouble; fix it and we will be happy to put it back up! We process too much content to pay attention to usernames, so please be assured that it's not some kind of mark against you as a participant :)\n\n# You're the best!\n\nWith all that out of the way, we love being part of such an active, caring community. By reporting rule-breaking content, upvoting good questions, and downvoting only when content is in bad faith or does not contribute meaningfully to the community, you help out more than you can know. **Please continue to do an excellent job being excellent to each other, and thank you!**",
