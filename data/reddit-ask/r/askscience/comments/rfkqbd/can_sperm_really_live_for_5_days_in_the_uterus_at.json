Can I get pregnant?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer I always see is that &amp;quot;yes you can because sperm can survive for upwards of 5 days in the female reproductive system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I had thought that 5 days was only under optimal conditions (namely fertile window leading into ovulation). Is it true that sperm can easily survive for 5 days during menstruation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a good study on this? I haven&amp;#39;t had luck finding it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
