It&#39;s become common to allow a bottle of liquor (whisky, cognac, etc) to &quot;rest&quot; after opening.  In fact, I just read this in a vodka review: &quot;It is Beluga’s philosophy to have this vodka rest after each step of the production,&quot; explains Borisov. After a five-time filtration process to achieve maximum smoothness, the vodka&#39;s final resting period is 90 days. &quot;This allows it to reach perfect balance and harmony,&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Since I always like to ask myself &quot;why is that&quot; and &quot;what mechanism is at work here&quot;, I&#39;m asking precisely that.  Is there some chemical change happening to drive a flavor shift or is this &quot;resting&quot; of a seemingly stable substance mostly psychological in nature.  If a sealed or capped bottled is allowed to &quot;rest&quot; sans additional oxygen or heat, how is it changing?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
