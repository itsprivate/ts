I was doing a bit of digging into the subject of STI&#39;s and how they are able to be transmitted and the likelihood of someone having it. Most of them were clear cut except herpes.\nHerpes, regardless of where I looked, had a different statistic.\nWHO (world health organizations) states that in one article about 14% of the world has herpes, yet in another says that 7 billion people have herpes. The CDC (Center for Disease Control and prevention) states that only half the world has herpes.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if these statistics are true or not as it seems weird to me that if any of them are true that no one would see this as a pandemic. \n( I am also lumping all forms of herpes together, seeing as if it truly is this bad we should look at it like we view cancer.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
