Also, it looks like the spike protein had more mutations before vaccines were even accessible yet. As a matter of fact, the N-protein had MORE selective pressure from the presence of natural immunity at the time (because it was the only type of immunity) and STILL was less mutable than the spike protein. And now, the spike protein is mutating even MORE with the vaccine. Could I be looking at the article incorrectly? It&amp;#39;s like the vaccine is doomed to some (un)planned obsolescence when using the spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have two questions, why would they select the most mutating protein, and why would the selective pressures from natural immunity not be as strong?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
