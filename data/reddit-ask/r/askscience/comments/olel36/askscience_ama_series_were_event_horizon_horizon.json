We&#39;ll be answering questions from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM Eastern Time!</p>\n\n<p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) - a planet-scale array of eleven ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration - was designed to capture images of a black hole. Two years ago, EHT researchers successfully unveiled the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow. The EHT recently released a new version of the historic image, now shown in polarized light.</p>\n\n<p>As we continue to delve into data from past observations and pave the way for the next-generation EHT, we wanted to answer some of your questions! You might ask us about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Observing with a global telescope array</li>\n<li>Black hole theory and simulations</li>\n<li>The black hole imaging process</li>\n<li>Technology and engineering in astronomy</li>\n<li>Recent and upcoming results</li>\n<li>International collaboration at the EHT</li>\n<li>The next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our Panel Members consist of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Richard Anantua, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Nicholas Conroy, Outreach and Science Technician at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Sheperd Doeleman, Founding Director of the Event Horizon Telescope and Astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Charles Gammie, Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Physics and Professor of Astronomy at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</li>\n<li>Kari Haworth, Chief Technology Officer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Sara Issaoun, PhD Student at Radboud University and incoming Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Dom Pesce, Astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Angelo Ricarte, Institute for Theory and Computation (ITC) Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</li>\n<li>Jonathan Weintroub, EHT Electrical Engineer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you&#39;d like to learn more about us, you can also check out our <a href=\"https://eventhorizontelescope.org/\">Website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ehtelescope/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ehtelescope\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ehtelescope\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sItzYomoJ6Flt0aDyHMOQ\">YouTube</a>.
