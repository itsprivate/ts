To simplify, I will make a clarification before going to sleep; for automobiles, what are the potential sources of ignition? The electrical wiring? The buildup of static charge? The heat in the engine components? Or the engine&#39;s combusting? ... For a brand new car what would be the main danger, and how has this changed over the years i.e. by using different materials?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
