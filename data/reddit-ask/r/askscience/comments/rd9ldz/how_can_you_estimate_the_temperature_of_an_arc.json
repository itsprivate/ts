I&amp;#39;m wondering if it is possible or if there are methods to estimate the temperature of a plasma generated from an high-frequency arc discharge in air, like arcs generated from an arc lighter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be dependant on the frequency, the distance between the electrodes or other things? The closest thing I found is related to the concept of electron temperature, but I haven&amp;#39;t found any clear way to compute it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help and have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
