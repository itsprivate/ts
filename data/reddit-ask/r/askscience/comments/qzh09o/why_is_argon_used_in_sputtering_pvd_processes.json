He said this graph explains it because argon has the highest yield, but it doesn&#39;t. Every noble gas below it in the periodic table has better yield (according to that graph).\nMy question is - why use argon? And what makes noble gases have the best yield for their row in the periodic table?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
