How can they cover so many signals, so many GPS-related needs with so few satellites? Do they not have a limit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, Elon is sending way more up just for satellite internet, if I am correct. Can someone please explain this to me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: First ever post here, one of the first posts/threads I&amp;#39;ve ever made. Sorry if something isn&amp;#39;t correct. Also wasn&amp;#39;t sure about the flair, although I hope Engineering covers it. Didn&amp;#39;t think Astronomy would fit, but idk. It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;multiple fields&amp;quot; of science. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And ~ thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
