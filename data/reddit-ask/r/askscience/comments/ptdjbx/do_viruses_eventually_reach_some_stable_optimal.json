Viruses have their genetic information encoded into RNA, as I understand it.  RNA is composed of several combinations of bases (ACUG), and these combinations functionally act as the viruses’ code.  Computers store information as bits, and there are a finite number of numbers that can be stored using any finite number of bits.  My thinking is, since there are only so many combinations of A, C, U, and G in a strand of RNA with finite length, there are only so many virus variants possible.  Eventually, selective pressures will force the disease to adopt some optimal configuration, such that any deviation from that variant creates a weaker virus.  At this point would it be possible to create a vaccine that targets this specific variant, therein effectively nullifying the disease since any other variant would be unable to get past the vaccine that protects against the <em>best</em> virus?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
