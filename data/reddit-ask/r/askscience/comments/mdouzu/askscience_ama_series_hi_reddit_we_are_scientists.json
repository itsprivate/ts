We're Yuan Jiang, Dave Heldebrant, and Casie Davidson from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and we're here to talk about carbon capture. Under DOE's Carbon Capture Program, researchers are working to both advance today's carbon capture technologies and uncover ways to reduce cost and energy requirements. We're happy to discuss capture goals, challenges, and concepts. Technologies range from aqueous amines - the water-rich solvents that run through modern, commercially available capture units - to energy-efficient membranes that filter CO2 from flue gas emitted by power plants. Our newest solvent, [EEMPA](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/cheaper-carbon-capture-way), can accomplish the task for as little as [$47.10 per metric ton](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/new-generation-carbon-dioxide-traps-could-make-carbon-capture-practical-bringing) - bringing post-combustion capture within reach of 45Q tax incentives.\n\nWe'll be on at 11am pacific (2 PM ET, 16 UT), ask us anything!\n\nUsername: /u/PNNL",
