I have read the [CDC update that came out earlier this year which detailed how the virus is spread primarily through respiratory droplets and not surface transmission, which said the chance was around 1 in 10,000 for every infected touch](<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html</a>). After doing a little more digging though, I saw that [some of the studies tested outside objects, like traffic light buttons](<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00966\">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00966</a>). I&#39;m wondering then, is the risk really considered that much higher without accounting for environmental factors like wind? The reason I ask is because I work at a grocery store that has basically done away with some of the early Covid safety precautions of last year. I go about my day touching self checkout screens, money, and even produce likely hundreds of times a day. I wash my hands frequently and use hand sanitizer a lot as well, but am I still putting people at risk?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
