My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?",
