The obvious answer is that the fan will always provide equal or more impulse in the opposite direction than it provides to the sail. Does this same principle apply to solar sails? If you had lasers on the back of a space ship pointed at solar sails in the front, would you move or would you end up stuck in place, i.e. do lasers apply a force back onto their emitters? If they do, much like how you can have a fan boat that just uses the fan for propulsion, no sail involved, could you just power a spaceship by just firing lasers in the opposite direction?</p>\n\n<p>I get that this kind of defeats the purpose of solar sails which are supposed to be super light and capable of traveling without needing a power source that could run out of energy. Plus solar sails would either be powered by the sun or massive solar arrays on earth which would provide much more energy and impulse than what the ship could carry with it. I’m more just asking from more of a theoretical standpoint than a practical one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
