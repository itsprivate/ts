I&#39;m a chemistry professor, science entertainer, and author that uses a theatrical and hands-on approach to teaching, all while trying to inspire students across the world to fall in love with science. You may have seen me in a blue lab coat and red-bottomed heels on <em>The Today Show</em>, <em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em>, <em>NBC Nightly News</em>, the <em>Wendy Williams Show</em>, the <em>Rachael Ray Show</em>, or <em>Late Night with Stephen Colbert</em>, where I try to make each explosion bigger than the last one. I travel the country collecting science advocates to be part of my STEM army, and we&#39;re working together to break down the image of the stereotypical scientist. Here&#39;s where 70 female scientists broke the record for the most thunderclouds at one time: <a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2020/02/10/kate-the-chemist-cbs-mission-unstoppable-show-taping/\">https://thedailytexan.com/2020/02/10/kate-the-chemist-cbs-mission-unstoppable-show-taping/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve published seven children&#39;s books, including the bestseller <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Chemist-Big-Book-Experiments/dp/059311616X\">The Big Book of Experiments</a>, and I cannot wait to hit the road next week to promote my new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Its-Elemental-Hidden-Chemistry-Everything/dp/0778389421\">It&#39;s Elemental: The Hidden Chemistry in Everything</a>. In the book, I highlight the ways we experience chemistry in our everyday lives; starting with breakfast and an early morning workout, to going to the beach and then happy hour, and finally ending the day by analyzing the science in the bedroom. It&#39;s my first nonfiction book for adults, and I&#39;m so excited to share it with you all!</p>\n\n<p>Want to see some explosions? Check out my first visit to the Today Show (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9DCSABs2U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9DCSABs2U</a>) or the time I scared the crap out of Stephen Colbert (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nELtaMKMP8o\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nELtaMKMP8o</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.katethechemist.com\">www.katethechemist.com</a> or follow me on Instagram (@katethechemist), TikTok (@katethechemist), and Twitter (@k8thechemist).
