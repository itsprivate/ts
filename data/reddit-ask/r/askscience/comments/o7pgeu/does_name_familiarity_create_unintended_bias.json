You know how it is. I had a customer I&#39;m not familiar with reach out and ask me for free accessory product with their purchase. This is at my discretion since I manage my own P/L - this particular customer had a name very similar to a close friend of mine who I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this weekend and recalling that made me feel a little happier. I immediately approved the request. I&#39;m not 100% sure I would have done that if they had a name I didn&#39;t feel connected to.</p>\n\n<p>So is there a measurable amount of favoritism that people give to strangers who have names similar to those they are close with. In contrast, could there be negative bias? If you hate your boss and then meet a friend of a friend with a similar name, are you more likely to have a negative first impression? How could you even measure this? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks, looking forward to the discussion!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
