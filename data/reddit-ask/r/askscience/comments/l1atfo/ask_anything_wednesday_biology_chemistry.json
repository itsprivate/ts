Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).
