The new show's three one-hour episodes take me on a worldwide quest for the key molecules and chemical reactions that make up human civilization, including concrete and fertilizer, plastic and rubber, fire and venom, explosives and hot peppers.\n\nI've written or cowritten more than 120 books, including dozens in the Missing Manual tech series, which I created in 1999; six books in the *For Dummies* line (including *Macs*, *Magic*, *Opera*, and *Classical Music*); two novels (one for middle-schoolers); my three bestselling *Pogue's Basics* books of tips and shortcuts (on *Tech*, *Money*, and *Life*); my how-to guides *iPhone Unlocked* and *Mac Unlocked*; and my 620-page magnum opus, *How to Prepare for Climate Change*.\n\nAfter graduating summa cum laude from Yale in 1985 with a distinction in music, I spent 10 years conducting and arranging Broadway musicals in New York. I won a Loeb Award for journalism, two Webby awards, and an honorary doctorate in music. I live in Connecticut and San Francisco with my wife Nicki and our blended brood of five spectacular children.\n\nFor a complete list of my columns and videos, and to sign up to get them by email, visit https://authory.com/davidpogue.
