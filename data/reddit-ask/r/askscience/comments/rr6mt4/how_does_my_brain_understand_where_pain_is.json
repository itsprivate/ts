However, the thing that eludes me is: how does brain know where the pain is &lt;strong&gt;spatially located&lt;/strong&gt;? For example, when my stomach hurts, I usually can point at the location of the pain, I can feel in what part of stomach the pain is localized. As far as I understand and my basic logic tells me, the brain needs to know where certain nerve endings are located spatially, the mapping of nerves and organs and the mapping of organs and their locations in my body. Does the brain learn the mapping when we grow up? Or is there another way of localizing of pain? How does the brain know where, e.g., my stomach is located spatially in my body?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly tried googling, but can&amp;#39;t seem to find anything remotely helpful. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction what I can read about to understand the answer to my question (e.g., how is this phenomena called)?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
