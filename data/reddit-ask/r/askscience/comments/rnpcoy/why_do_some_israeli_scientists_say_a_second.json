Some experts have warned that too many shots eventually may lead to a sort of &lt;strong&gt;immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few members of the advisory panel raised that concern with respect to the elderly, according to a written summary of the discussion obtained by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes googling didn&amp;#39;t uncover anything. I&amp;#39;m concerned because I heard Osterholm &lt;a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/magellan-in-the-know/the-coming-viral-blizzard-XHv9nkeWfQ4/\"&gt;mention&lt;/a&gt; (37:00) long covid may be the result of a compromised immune system. Could the fourth shot set the stage for reinfection and/or long term side effects? Or is it merely a wasted shot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
