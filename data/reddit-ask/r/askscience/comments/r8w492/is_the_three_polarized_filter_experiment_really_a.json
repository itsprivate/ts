But it&amp;#39;s done my head in a bit because my immediate thought was simply that the experiment is flawed and the light is just in a reflection loop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Light passes through filter A, half of it continues through filter B toward C. The other half is reflected back toward filter A where half of it passes through in the opposite direction and the remaining half of the bounced light again reflects back toward filter B where half of it continues through toward filter C making it brighter. Upon each reflection, the light is slightly scattered and its directionality will be altered allowing it to pass. Add to that that a large amount of light was bounced off of C initially which will have gone through the same reflection paths. This goes in a decreasing loop adding brightness to C until you get the significant boost their experiments observed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, this doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be a great demonstration of quantum uncertainty because it is explainable through a more certain physical process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is this: what am I missing? Why do scientists go so far down the quantum rabbit hole to explain this &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; phenomenon that seems perfectly reasonable to me and why is my explanation not reasonable. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
