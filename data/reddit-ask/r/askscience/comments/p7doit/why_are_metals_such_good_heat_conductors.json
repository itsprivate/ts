In high school we were taught that metals create lattices, in which the electrons are more or less free to move around and create a current (things like carbon also create lattices eg. diamonds but those are not conductive because the electron valence shells are very stable with 4 bonds). Same idea for why some metals can be magnetized, or why they glow when heated.. but why are they such good conductors of <em>heat</em>? If heat is measured as the &#39;jiggling&#39; of atoms, then why should a solid piece of metal lattice conduct much heat at all?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
