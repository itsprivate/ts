Nor are they always famously featured in TV shows or movies, like Rosie from The Jetsons.\n\nAt the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, robots are the workhorses that help our scientists advance energy storage and bioenergy research.\n\nFor example, robotic platforms are integral to helping us investigate and develop materials for energy storage applications to bolster modernization of the nation's grid.  These robotic partners help our scientists do more experiments with significantly lower labor and material costs than if conducted manually. They also allow us to effectively test formulations - literally thousands of them - for the most optimal materials conditions.\n\nIn the bioenergy realm, robots housed in our [High Throughput Center](https://www.pnnl.gov/high-throughput-center) handle routine and repetitive tasks and empower our researchers to investigate materials while accelerating understanding and production of biofuels and bioproducts. With the robots' help, multiple experiments can run in parallel, helping us perform hundreds more experiments than with manual methods.  One catalyst testing instrument can reduce four months of research to just two weeks.  Additionally, one sample preparation robot can produce more than 200 formulations in a single day, something that would take a researcher a full week to do - not to mention keeping track of it all, often with greater accuracy and precision, while avoiding repetitive strain injury.\n\nOur research in grid energy storage and bioenergy is typically supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's [Office of Electricity](https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity) and [Bioenergy Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy), respectively.\n\nWe \"bot\" you think all this robot talk is cool! We sure do.\n\nCome ask us questions about our cool energy storage and bioenergy breakthroughs and how our robots are helping. We will be back at noon PDT (3 PM ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions!\n\nUsername: /u/PNNL",
