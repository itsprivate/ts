Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.\n\nBecause methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.\n\nWe are:\n\n+ Drew Shindell - Professor of Earth science at Duke University\n+ Jean-Francois Lemarque - Director of the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research\n+ Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute\n+ Bill Collins - Professor of Climate Processes at University of Reading\n+ Nathan Borgford-Parnell - Science Affairs Coordinator at the Climate & Clean Air Coalition\n\nMethane doesn't always get the attention that it deserves, so we were pleased to see the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/urgent-methane-cuts-needed-rein-climate-change-un-says-2021-04-27/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56933443), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/cut-methane-emissions-rapidly-fight-climate-disasters-un-report-greenhouse-gas-global-heating) and many others highlighting our report - but now we're here to dive into the details.
