We just published results from our work on technology that translates signals from the brain region that normally controls the muscles of the vocal tract directly into full words and sentences. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to show that intended messages can be decoded from speech-related brain activity in a person who is paralyzed and unable to speak naturally. This new paper is the culmination of more than a decade of research in the lab led by UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang, MD.</p>\n\n<p>Off the bat, we want to clarify one common misconception about our work: We are not able to &quot;read minds&quot; and this is not our goal! Our technology detects signals aimed at the muscles that make speech happen, meaning that we&#39;re capturing intentional attempts at outward speech, not general thoughts or the &quot;inner voice&quot;. Our entire motivation is to help restore independence and the ability to speak to people who can&#39;t communicate using assistive methods.</p>\n\n<p>Our work differs from previous neuroprostheses in a critical way: Other studies have focused on restoring communication through spelling-based approaches, typing out letters one-by-one. Our team is translating signals intended to control muscles of the vocal system for speaking words, rather than signals to move the arm or hand to enable typing or control of a computer cursor.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we want to note that this is very early work conducted with a single person as a proof of concept. This study participant &quot;Bravo-1&quot;, to whom we&#39;re extremely grateful, is a man in his late 30s who suffered a devastating brainstem stroke that severely damaged the connection between his brain and his vocal tract and limbs. Because he is unable to speak naturally or move his hands to type, to communicate he typically uses assistive technology controlled by minute and effortful head movements.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize the approach used in this study, we surgically implanted a high-density electrode array over his speech motor cortex (the part of the brain that normally controls the vocal tract). We then used machine learning to model complex patterns in his brain activity as he tried to say 50 common words. Afterwards, we used these models and a natural-language model to translate his brain activity into the words and sentences he attempted to say.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we hope this type of neurotechnology can make communication faster and more natural for those who are otherwise unable to speak due to stroke, neurodegenerative disease (such as ALS), or traumatic brain injury. But we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do before something like this is available to patients at large.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://tiny.ucsf.edu/zcNuQr\">Here&#39;s a UCSF press release about the study and how the technology works, including an animation of the setup of the trial.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMcf1fXdW8\">Here&#39;s a video on our study from UCSF.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027540\">Here&#39;s a direct link to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We&#39;re here to answer questions and, hopefully, to raise awareness of communication neuroprosthetics as a field of study and means of improving the lives of people around the world.\nAnswering questions today are the co-lead authors of the new study:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>David A. Moses, Ph.D., postdoctoral engineer</li>\n<li>Sean L. Metzger, M.S., doctoral student</li>\n<li>Jessie R. Liu, B.S., doctoral student</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hi, Reddit! We’re online and excited to answer your questions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
