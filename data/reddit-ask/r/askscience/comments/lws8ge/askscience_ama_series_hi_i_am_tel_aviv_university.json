They are better described as multicellular organisms. In each tumor there are complex interactions with immune cells, which cause inflammation processes in the connective tissue and blood vessels.\n\nIn my lab, we study these interactions to understand how tumor cells \"hijack\" physiological pathways and use them to support their growth. Additionally, we also study the link between cancer and inflammation,specifically how cancer cells metastasize and grow in distant organs from their original host.\n\nProf. Erez studies the biology of tumor metastasis, focusing on the metastatic microenvironment, cancer-related inflammation and the role of stromal and immune cells in facilitating the early and late stages of metastasis. Prof. Erez's work focuses on these crucial aspects of cancer. She uses mouse models of carcinogenesis and metastasis of melanoma, breast, and ovarian carcinoma. The main goal of her research is to identify and characterize key molecular pathways in the communication between tumor cells and their microenvironment that can be targeted by novel therapeutics.\n\nProf. Erez began her academic career at the Weizmann Institute of Science. She obtained her PhD in the field of molecular cell biology under the guidance of Prof. Varda Rotter.  Supported by a fellowship from the Cancer Research Institute (CRI), Prof. Erez carried out her postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Prof. Doug Hanahan at UCSF, working in the field of tumor biology (2005-2010). During her postdoctoral fellowship she demonstrated a novel role for cancer-associated fibroblasts in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation. Following her postdoctoral work, she joined the Department of Pathology at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in October 2010, and currently serves as the Department Chair.\n\nI will be on at 10am PT (1 PM ET, 18 UT), Ask Me Anything!\n\nLearn more about my lab: https://www.netaerezlab.sites.tau.ac.il/\n\nUsername: /u/IsraelinSF\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: Please note the correction in time.",
