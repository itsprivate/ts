I would have thought it would be the opposite (due to older people having weaker immune systems)? Can someone explain this phenomenon? Is this something of all vaccines? What&#39;s the biological mechanism here?</p>\n\n<p>Refer to table 1 of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm</a>: 64.9% of 18 to 49 report an adverse reaction. I thought perhaps it was to do with unequal category sizes (18 to 49, versus say 50 to 64), but I don&#39;t think it is as this represents 2/3 of the total.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I really don&#39;t want to get into a debate about whether or not people should take the vaccine or not (I think people at risk, definitely should). I simply want to understand why vaccines effect different age groups in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>(For some reason moderators removed this post... This is a legitimate medicinal question, but for some reason I&#39;m not even allowed to ask it)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
