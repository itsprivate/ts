  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in how science and art overlap? So are we! We are scientists and artists who use a variety of artistic media to create works of art that showcase microbiology in our world. Some of us use combinations of microbes &amp;quot;painted&amp;quot; on nutritional agar; others use more traditional artistic platforms like drawings and photography to express our ideas. What we have in common (other than our love of microbiology and art) is that we are all winners of the American Society for Microbiology&amp;#39;s 2021 &lt;a href=\"https://asm.org/Events/ASM-Agar-Art-Contest/Home\"&gt;Agar Art Contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://asm.org/\"&gt;American Society for Microbiology&lt;/a&gt; has organized this annual contest since 2015, inviting scientists, artists, and anyone with an interest in the intersection of science and art, to create and submit their microbial artwork. This is a rugged competition: each year there are hundreds of entries from around the world that are narrowed down through two rounds of expert judging to identify the winners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us today for a discussion about our individual artistic inspirations and creative processes. We&amp;#39;ll answer your questions about how to turn microbes (and microbial ideas and concepts) into works of art. We&amp;#39;ll be jumping on from 2 - 4 PM ET (7 PM - 9 PM UTC). Ask us anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With us today are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Sarah Adkins-Jablonsky, Ph.D. (&lt;a href=\"/u/EvolvedtoHibernate\"&gt;u/EvolvedtoHibernate&lt;/a&gt;)- Medical student, Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sonja Borndörfer (&lt;a href=\"/u/Sonja-1008\"&gt;u/Sonja-1008&lt;/a&gt;)- Student, University of Applied Sciences Weihenstephan-Triesdorf&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mireya Duran (&lt;a href=\"/u/tigerlily0423\"&gt;u/tigerlily0423&lt;/a&gt;)- Medical Laboratory Scientist, Texas Health (Dallas)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Judy Nguyen, Ph.D. (&lt;a href=\"/u/judynwin\"&gt;u/judynwin&lt;/a&gt;)- Administrator, Monarch Butterfly Friends Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Natascha Varona (&lt;a href=\"/u/NataschaVarona\"&gt;u/NataschaVarona&lt;/a&gt;)- Ph.D. Student, University of Miami&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://asm.org/Events/ASM-Agar-Art-Contest/Home\"&gt;https://asm.org/Events/ASM-Agar-Art-Contest/Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fems-microbiology.org/and-the-winners-of-microbeart2021-are/\"&gt;https://fems-microbiology.org/and-the-winners-of-microbeart2021-are/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/painting-with-penicillin-alexander-flemings-germ-art-1761496/\"&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/painting-with-penicillin-alexander-flemings-germ-art-1761496/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
