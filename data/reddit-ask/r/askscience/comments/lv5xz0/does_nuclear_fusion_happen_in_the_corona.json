The equation (3/2)nkT = e^2 /r gives a temperature of ~10^10 K, but taking into account quantum tunneling and using the de Broglie wavelength as the radius of the nucleus, you can get a much lower temperature of ~10^7 K. \n\nThat's pretty close to the temperatures observed in the corona. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem) even mentions that the corona is 10^6 K and parts of it can reach even of 10^7 K, though doesn't have a source attached to it. \n\nSo does that mean that there are parts of the corona the can fuse hydrogen? I'm assuming the answer is no, and that you need a relatively high pressure as well for fusion to happen, but pressure doesn't seem to appear in the equations. Are the calculations above just approximations to get the order of magnitude for the temperature?",
