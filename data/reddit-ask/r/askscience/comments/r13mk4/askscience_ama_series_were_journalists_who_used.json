Bernice and Michael <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/on-the-line\">have spent years reporting on the U.S. meatpacking industry</a>, while Irena used her background in bioinformatics to track salmonella infantis, a dangerous strain that&#39;s sickened tens of thousands of people, including some who died, in the past few years. Other countries have all but eliminated salmonella in poultry, but in America, infantis has been allowed to spread and continues to make people sick. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety\">The USDA knows about it. The meat industry knows about it. But the public? Not so much</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most people know that cooking poultry kills salmonella, but many studies found that cooks routinely cross-contaminate their kitchen surfaces after handling raw meats, which means that bacteria like salmonella are still a risk.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to publishing a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety\">huge exposé on the outbreak</a>, we also made <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/\">a database that lets anyone look up where their chicken or turkey came from, as well as how often dangerous salmonella was found</a> by USDA inspectors. We call it <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/\">Chicken Checker</a>. In spite of the name, Chicken Checker also lets you look up turkey. Happy Thanksgiving. Keep up w/ ProPublica on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/propublica\">Twitter</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=social\">Email</a>, and we&#39;ll see you all starting around 11 am ET (16 UT), AUA!</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. If you look up your chicken on <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/\">Chicken Checker</a>, be sure to fill out the information at the bottom of the page - it&#39;ll help us track supply chains and do more journalism that helps consumers).</p>\n\n<p>Username: <a href=\"/u/propublica_\">/u/propublica_</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
