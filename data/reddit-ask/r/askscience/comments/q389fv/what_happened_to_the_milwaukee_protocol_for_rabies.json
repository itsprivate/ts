It also appears that the success story from Texas that it cites actually involves someone <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5907a1.htm\">who was not treated with the MP at all</a> so its accuracy may be questionable.</p>\n\n<p>All that makes me wonder, is the MP a red herring as some people have claimed or is it a legitimate way to try to save a patient in a desperate situation? Most human rabies cases are in poor countries where a treatment regimen like this isn&#39;t a viable option anyways but for the occasional kid who gets bitten by a bat in the US and doesn&#39;t get PEP is it worth trying?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
