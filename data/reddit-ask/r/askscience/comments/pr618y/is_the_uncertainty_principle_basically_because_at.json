  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Basically my question boils down to the fact that to me at least it seems to intuitively make sense that the quantum scale makes measurement hard but I don&#39;t see many people talk about it like this and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;ve managed to get the wrong end of the stick. </p>\n\n<p>Like if I want to measure a javelin in flight I can use video. There are a crap ton of photons bouncing off it all the time that allow me to see where it is, I record these over multiple frames and bam I&#39;ve got both where it is and where it is going, easy.</p>\n\n<p>Now if we try that same thing again where I&#39;m trying to measure a photon in flight, well now if I was in a well lit stadium like for the javelin, it would seem to me at least to be a bit like trying to measure a snooker ball with another snooker ball with billions of other snooker balls flying around.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly when you think about it like that then the idea that if I carefully created a lattice of photons with a corresponding detector then if one of the corresponding detectors didn&#39;t end up receiving its photon we could say hey I know it was there but seeing as I&#39;ve blasted it with another photon, I have no clue where it is now. </p>\n\n<p>Given this complexity (if I&#39;ve even got it half right) it seems to me at least like most explanations of quantum experiments at least at the undergrad level don&#39;t really talk about the mechanics of measurement or observation and so it all sounds a lot more spooky and without those bits of info it&#39;s harder for people to reason about. Like the uncertainty principle sounds crazy until you start thinking that the only way to measure is to collide.</p>\n\n<p>Now I realise that even the term collide is potentially a massive over simplification of the interaction of forces at the particle level but I hope it conveys what I see as the problem. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah I had what felt like a flash of insight into what all the the uncertainty principle was explaining but then it seems weird that we just talk about experiments in simplified terms like observation, wave function collapse and kind of avoid talking about what they even mean by that and how they accomplish that. I mean I get that the maths behind quantum mechanics explains what we observe but I mean more about the experimental methods we use to confirm the maths and how we observe the quantum level from a macro level.</p>\n\n<p>So the crux of the question is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is the uncertainty principle basically because at that level, to measure the system you have to interfere with the system somehow?</p></li>\n<li><p>If that is correct, then it seems like the way we are taught about the experimental proof is very light on how we interfere with quantum scale stuff to try and measure them and I&#39;d love pointers to good science explainer that go into a good level of detail on this</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
