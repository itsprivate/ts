An outbreak of syphilis would wreck havoc in a pod of dolphins. There may be survivors that recover and possibly develop a resistance…. provided they don’t get reinfected, the disease doesn’t mutate, their reproductive organs aren’t compromised, etc. So, what’s the science behind a species surviving from an STD outbreak in the wild kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
