How can they remember everything of their lives if the number of neurons doesn&#39;t really change much after birth? (Or is this part already been proven wrong? The lecture is from 2012 and at that point the professor said that only the hyppocampus can create completely new neurons but not the cortex.)</p>\n\n<p>Now if instead, those people just have a brain that has a better ability to create new neurons, that would actually make a lot more sense.
