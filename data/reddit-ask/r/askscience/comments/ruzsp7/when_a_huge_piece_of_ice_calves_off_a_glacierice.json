Essentially, I have always wondered whether sea levels around the world rise simultaneously when something large enters the ocean (e.g. an iceberg forms in Greenland and sea levels in the Pacific rise immediately once the initial wave caused by the falling ice settles), or whether it takes a period of days or even weeks for the effects of the sea level rise to be felt thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m aware this may sound like a dumb question but I have been unable to find any clear answers to this and I am genuinely curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should clarify, when I say instant, I don’t mean it literally. I’m more meaning it as being a very rapid sea level rise rather than gradual/slow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
