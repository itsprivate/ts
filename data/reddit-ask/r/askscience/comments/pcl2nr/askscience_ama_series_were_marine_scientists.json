During the cruise we have used all this equipment to explore the deep sea through mapping, imaging, and sampling the seafloor and water column. We&#39;ve seen cold-water corals, sponges, fish, sea cucumbers, anemones, mud and rocky substrate!</p>\n\n<p>This cruise is part of the EU Horizon 2020 project <a href=\"https://www.iatlantic.eu/\">iAtlantic</a>.
