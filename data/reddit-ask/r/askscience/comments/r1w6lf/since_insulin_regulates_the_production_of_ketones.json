When insulin levels are cut too far down from a low carb diet, why doesn’t ketoacidosis occur? Do Type 1 Diabetics on keto produce more ketones because of this? And if so, does that mean that they can shred excess fat at a more effective rate than someone without the disease?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
