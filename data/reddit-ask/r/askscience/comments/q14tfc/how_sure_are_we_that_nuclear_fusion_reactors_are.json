Asked another way, I am wondering if fusion reactors are something that we can definitely make it is just a matter of figuring out the technology... Or if it&#39;s something that hypothetically can totally exist (thermonuclear bombs work, after all) but scientists are still unsure if the constraints of &#39;a continuous reaction that gives off more energy than it requires&#39; can be reasonably met.</p>\n\n<p>A sort of parallel idea here to illustrate what I&#39;m talking about: we know that small flying vehicles (ie: flying cars) can totally exist, but that they are totally impractical as a solution that everyone will use to get around.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
