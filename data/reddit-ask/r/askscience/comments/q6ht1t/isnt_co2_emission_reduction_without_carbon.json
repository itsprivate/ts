Right now the energy surplus from solar radiation on the earth is somewhere around 1 W/m², which leads to warming. If we hypothetically reduced our CO2 output to zero instantly, we&#39;d still maintain the same CO2 atmosphere content and thus radioation surplus and the same rate of change, so the earth would still heat up at the current pace, right? Am I missing something? And if I&#39;m not, isn&#39;t it then mandatory to also look into ways of reducing the rate of change of temperature, rather than only trying to reduce the pace at which the rate of change rises (=reducing emissions)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
