The Radium isotope with the longest half life is Ra<sup>256,</sup> which is an alpha emitter.  The longest lived Polonium isotope has a half life of 4 months and is also an alpha emitter.  She worked with Uranium and Thorium - much longer lived but also alpha emitters. So you should be able to store them in a cardboard box - you just don&#39;t want to handle them in ways that might cause you to ingest or breathe in radioactive material.   So what are they contaminated with that requires a lead box?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
