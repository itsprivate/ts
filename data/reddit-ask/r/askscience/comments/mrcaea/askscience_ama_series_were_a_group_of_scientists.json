Yet, many pose a hazard to human health and the environment, which means it's more important than ever to create safer, more sustainable alternatives.\n\nWe're exploring new applications for bio-based solvents, such as Cyrene™ - a dipolar aprotic solvent that is derived from cellulose and produced in one step from levoglucosenone (LGO), a versatile chemical building block. This solvent can be used for the production and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the engineering of plastics and the manufacturing and recycling of electronic components.\n\nIn addition to determining new applications for Cyrene™ solvent, we're also working on further developments for other LGO derivatives. These next-gen solvents can play a crucial role in more sustainable chemistry. For example, when compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolione (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), two solvents under increasing regulatory restrictions due to their toxicity, Cyrene™ solvent offers superior performance in some applications. Additionally, its low toxicity falls well below the hazard thresholds defined by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.\n\nHere to answer your questions about greener solvents are:\n\n+ Dr. Jane Murray (/u/GreenJanem): I am the global head of green chemistry at Merck. I have a background in chemical research-having completed my Ph.D. at the University of York, where I researched green oxidations of organosulfur compounds using hydrogen peroxide. In my current role, I enjoy partnering with academics to introduce novel green chemistry technologies to the scientific community. I was named an Environment+Energy Leader 100 Honoree in 2020.\n+ Dr. Jason Camp (/u/DrJasonCamp): I am the chief technology officer at Circa Group. Prior to joining Circa, I had over 10 years of experience as an independent academic at various UK universities, during which I conducted research and published extensively in the areas of green chemistry and sustainable solvents, including Cyrene™. In addition, I have served on the Society of Chemical industry's (SCI) Fine Chemicals Group since 2014 and am currently the secretary of the SCI's Science and Enterprise Group.\n+ James Clark (/u/GreenJamesClark): I am a scientific advisor at Circa Group, professor at the University of York and director of the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence. I have played a leading role in green and sustainable chemistry over the last 20 years, and have published over 400 related articles in that period. My activities in research, education and industrial collaboration have led to prizes and awards from the Royal Society of Chemistry, the SCI and EUChemS, as well as honorary doctorates from universities in Belgium, Germany and Sweden.\n\nWe'll be answering questions about our work on bio-based solvent developments from 11 a.m. EDT - 1 p.m. EDT (15-17 UT).
