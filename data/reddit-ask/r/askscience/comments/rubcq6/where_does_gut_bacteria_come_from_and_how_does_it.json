Are there shelters or locations where they harbour and multiply?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 3: For someone with damaged digestive bacteria, what are the challenges in restoring the bacteria to these locations once lost (from heavy antibiotics, say)?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
