  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve doing some research into non Newtonian fluids specifically dilatant or fluids that appear to be dilatant (have an increase in viscosity when force is applied).  Iâ€™m working on a project where I need a fluid that can be be liquid and easily allow a slow moving object to pass through but to provide resistant and to slow down a fast moving object.  My issue is I donâ€™t have a way of holding the liquid in place since any objects passing through a container would cause a leek and all the liquid would spill out.  My idea was if you can have a liquid thatâ€™s both a non Newtonian dilatant liquid and a ferrofluid then it could be held by magnets in place.  Is this something that is possible? Or does anyone have any suggestions or book suggestions. Iâ€™m not sure where to direct my research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: after reading some comments.  Iâ€™m looking for a sheer thickening non Newtonian fluid specifically and Iâ€™m not sure ferrofluid is the correct term to use but I want it to be magnetic so I can hold it in place.  Sorry Iâ€™m not super well versed in this topic itâ€™s quite complicated ðŸ˜…. I also wanted to provide some context Iâ€™m attempting to make a target for shooting practice that would use a sheer thickening fluid to slow the bullet but my issue is how to hold the liquid in place in a way where after the first bullet is fired the whole thing wonâ€™t simply leak everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
