We want to know why! And, we think the gut microbiome may hold some of the answers.\n\nThere are billions of bacteria in the gut. In fact, the gut microbiome has been implicated in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.\n\nTogether with my Hillman and Pitt colleague Dr. Hassane Zarour, we looked at the success and failure of cancer immunotherapy and discovered that cancer patients who did well with anti-PD1 immunotherapy had different gut bacteria microorganisms. So, what if we could change the gut bacteria? What if we transplanted the good bacteria from those who responded to treatment into the patients who did not respond? In a small first-in-human trial, we found that this just might work! A tremendously exciting finding.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of cancer treatment? We think altering the gut microbiome has great potential to change the impact of immunotherapy across all cancers. We still have a way to go, including getting more specific with what microbes we transfer. We also want to ultimately replace FMT with pills containing a cocktail of the most beneficial microbes for boosting immunotherapy.\n\nRead more about our study here - https://hillmanresearch.upmc.edu/fecal-transplant-boosts-cancer-immunotherapy/\n\nYou can find me on twitter [@diwakardavar](https://twitter.com/diwakardavar) and Dr. Zarour [@HassaneZarour](https://twitter.com/HassaneZarour).
