Or does it develop 1-2 mutations reproducing in A, and go to B and mutate a few ways, then C?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many mutations can occur in an individual host? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, how many mutations would omicron need to become another variant that’s being tracked by authorities as a new thing? I’d assume just one if that one meant it travelled more successfully than omicron? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s say we think of It like vehicles. Is this more like the Ford E350 where it can a bus or fire truck or ambulance or FedEx depending on what back you put on, but the core truck is the same? Or is more like a Toyota where each model broke off from another model by becoming roomier or sportier or fancier?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
