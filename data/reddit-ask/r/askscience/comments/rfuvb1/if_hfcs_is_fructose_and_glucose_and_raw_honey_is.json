So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that honey has enzymes, minerals and vitamins making it somewhat beneficial, but this doesn’t change how the body absorbs and metabolizes fructose whether in HFCS or honey. So what’s the deal here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is honey just as bad as HFCS or is HFCS not as bad as it is made out to be? Or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
