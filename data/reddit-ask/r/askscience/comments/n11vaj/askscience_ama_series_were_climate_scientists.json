We'll be around for the next several hours to answer your questions about climate change and more. A little more about us:\n\n[Michael Oppenheimer](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-oppenheimer/), Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton University: My [research and teaching](https://scholar.princeton.edu/oppenheimer) focus on climate change and its impacts, especially sea level rise and human migration. My research group examines how households and societies manage the impacts of sea level rise and coastal storms, the increasing risk these bring as Earth warms, and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase adaptation and limit the risks. We also model the effect of climate change on human migration which is a longstanding adaptation to climate variations. We project future climate-driven migration and analyze policies that can ease the burden on migrants and their origin and destination communities. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClimateOpp).\n\n[Corinne Le Quéré](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-lequere/), Royal Society Professor of Climate Change Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK: I conduct research on the interactions between [climate change (ePDF)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x.epdf) and the carbon cycle, including the drivers of [CO2 emissions (ePDF)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01001-0.epdf) and the response of the natural carbon sinks. I Chair the French High council on climate and sit on the UK Climate Change Committee, two independent advisory boards that help guide climate actions in their respective governments. I am author of three IPCC reports, former director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and of the annual update of the global carbon budget by the Global Carbon Project.

I'm committed to helping scale the technologies we need to achieve a path to net zero emissions by 2050, and thinking through the process of getting these technologies deployed around the world in ways that can both improve people's lives and protect the environment. Visit my [lab page](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeira-lab) and follow my [blog](https://kencaldeira.wordpress.com/).\n\n[Carlos Duarte](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-duarte/), Distinguished Professor and Tarek Ahmed Juffali Research Chair in Red Sea Ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in Saudi Arabia: My [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_M._Duarte) focuses on understanding the effects of climate change in marine ecosystems and developing ocean-based solutions to global challenges, including climate change, and develop evidence-based strategies to rebuild the abundance of marine life by 2050. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duarteoceans).\n\n[Julie Arblaster](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-arblaster/): I'm a climate scientist with expertise in using climate models to understand mechanisms of recent and future climate change.\n\nKaveh Madani, Visiting Scholar (Yale University) and Visiting Professor (Imperial College London): [My work](https://www.kavehmadani.com/about) focuses on mathematical modeling of complex, coupled human-environment systems to advise policy makers.

He is a reporter and editor on the Reuters enterprise unit based in New York City. His other work includes \"[Ocean Shock](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/ocean-shock/),\" an expansive examination of how climate change is causing chaos for fisheries around the planet.
