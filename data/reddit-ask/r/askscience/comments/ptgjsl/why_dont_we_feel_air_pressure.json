I understand that our bodies don&#39;t collapse (or at least squish a bit) because they&#39;re basically incompressible (cavities excepted), but I would still expect to feel it. According to Wikipedia the air pressure at sea level is around 1kg/cm<sup>2,</sup> which is a lot, but I can pinch my arm with far less pressure than that and still feel it clearly. It&#39;s been a few years now, but I&#39;ve also dived to a depth of around 12m where the pressure is significantly greater, and I don&#39;t recall a feeling of e.g. my legs being squeezed on all sides.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
