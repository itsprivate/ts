I have been studying the world&#39;s most threatened mammals for more than 15 years across six of the seven continents.</p>\n\n<p>I received a B.S. in Environmental Studies from <a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/\">Emory University</a>, a M.S. in Environmental Studies from <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/\">Yale University</a>, and a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution from <a href=\"http://e3b.columbia.edu/\">Columbia University</a>. I am currently a Research Faculty member at the <a href=\"https://bren.ucsb.edu/\">Bren School of Environmental Science and Management</a> leading carnivore research on the <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/stories-in-california/dangermond-preserve/\">Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve</a>. I am also a <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/explorers/rae-wynn-grant/\">National Geographic Explorer</a>, and a Visiting Scientist at the <a href=\"http://amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My latest venture is a podcast from PBS Nature called &quot;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/podcast/\">Going Wild with Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant</a>.&quot; In it I tell my stories from the field, from encountering giraffe poachers while tracking lion cubs in Tanzania, to discovering never-before-seen population of the world&#39;s most endangered lemur in Madagascar, to giving CPR to a hibernating black bear in Minnesota. My hope is to encourage the next generation of wildlife ecologists. Listen <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/going-wild-with-dr-rae-wynn-grant/id1583296781\">here</a> or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll be on at 11 am PST/2 pm EST/19 UT to answer your questions.
