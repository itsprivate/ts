  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a toy floating around my advertisements that looks like a small ball with a fan on the inside. You’re supposed to be able to toss it and it will come back to you. It’s called the fly orb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is though, is this single “propeller” enough to give this toy full flight capabilities (ex. up, down, left, right, etc)? OR is it not able to fly and control itself alone due to their only being one propeller and that’s the reason why the toy is advertised to just return to your hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit1: Could also ask in this way, is a single vertical propeller enough to create a drone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am asking this here because 1. I am no scientist and 2. I have no idea how to look that up because the search terms are just too long. Hopefully the question makes sense, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Thanks for the fantastic responses! For future reference the short answer is no, one propeller is not enough for quadcopter like flight. The replies below explain further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit3: Thanks again for the great responses. So the answer above is not totally wrong, however it should be noted that single prop. copters utilize multiple stabilization techniques to achieve flight. Links are provided by the wonderfully smart posters below!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
