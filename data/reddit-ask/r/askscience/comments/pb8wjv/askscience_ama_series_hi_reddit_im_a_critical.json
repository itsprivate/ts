My name is Marc Moss, and for the last 20 years, I have been studying the effects of stress on critical care nurses and other healthcare professionals.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Head of the Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and work as a critical care doctor.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, my colleague Dr. Meredith Mealer and I were honored to receive the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) Pioneering Spirit Award for our work studying the effects of stress on nurses and creating interventions to increase resilience among healthcare workers.</p>\n\n<p>Among these interventions includes work at the <a href=\"https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/coral/our-team\">Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab</a>, a research consortium supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. We are striving to create a vibrant, collaborative creative arts therapy community that is committed to enhancing healthcare professional well-being and alleviating psychological stress in the workplace and\nbeyond.</p>\n\n<p>While I&#39;ve been studying healthcare-related burnout for many years, this last year and a half during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a war zone for our healthcare professionals. I have never been prouder of all of my colleagues and the amazing hospital employees that we work with on a daily basis. They are working long hours in difficult conditions, putting on and taking off protective equipment, while trying not to get sick themselves, or infect their families and children. You would be honored to witness their extraordinary and relentless efforts to care for our sickest patients. However the relentless stress is taking its toll on all of us. I am afraid that the next wave will &quot;break our souls&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to critical care-related research, my research interests include identifying new treatment modalities for patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and exploring the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular dysfunction in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation.</p>\n\n<p>Additional Background:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Head of the Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine at the CU Anschutz School of Medicine</li>\n<li>Program Director for the Education, Training, and Career Development Core of the Colorado Clinical Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI) from 2008-2016</li>\n<li>President of the American Thoracic Society from 2017-2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Research Publications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6207112/\">The Cost of Caring: Emotion, Burnout and Psychological Distress in Critical Care Clinicians</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201604-0708ST\">A Critical Care Societies Collaborative Statement: Burnout Syndrome in Critical Care Health-care Professionals.
