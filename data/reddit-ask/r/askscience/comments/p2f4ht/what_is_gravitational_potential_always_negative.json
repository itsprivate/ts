What I do not understand is why does the gravitational potential not increase when an object approaches the source mass. The gravitational potential energy increases but the gravitational potential decreases. So, I think what my question really is about how gravitational potential is defined. ( i know the book definition,But I don’t understand how ....it works exactly)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: </p>\n\n<p>so as far as I understand now, it is that using 0 potential for infinite distance from the source mass is just a matter of convention as gravitational potential at any point is in reference to the gravitational potential at another point( its comparative) and hence it can be negative. If I am still not right, please help me improve my understanding</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
