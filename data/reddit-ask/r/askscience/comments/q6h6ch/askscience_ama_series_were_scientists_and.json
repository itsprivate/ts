On Oct. 16, NASA&#39;s Lucy mission is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to explore these small worlds for the first time. Lucy was named after the fossilized human ancestor (called &quot;Lucy&quot; by her discoverers) whose skeleton expanded our understanding of human evolution. The Lucy Mission hopes to expand our understanding of solar system evolution by visiting these 4.5-billion-year-old planetary &quot;fossils.&quot; We are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jeremy Knittel, Senior Mission Design and Navigation Engineer at KinetX Aerospace</li>\n<li>Amy Simon, Senior Planetary Scientist for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</li>\n<li>Audrey Martin, Graduate Research Assistant at Northern Arizona University</li>\n<li>Cory Prykull, Systems Integration and Test Supervisor at Lockheed Martin</li>\n<li>Joel Parker, Director at Southwest Research Institute</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All about the Lucy mission: <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/lucy\">www.nasa.gov/lucy</a></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll be here from from 2-3 p.m. EDT (18-19 UT), ask us anything!</p>\n\n<p>Username: <a href=\"/u/NASA\">/u/NASA</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
