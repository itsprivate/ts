He responded a bit later that he had &amp;quot;fallen for it&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t really have a visceral response when he read &amp;quot;POWs&amp;quot; but did when he read &amp;quot;prisoners of war&amp;quot; in my text, even though afaik he knows what POW stands for.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to find studies on how acronyms affect our thinking in situations like this but I mostly just find the list of abbreviations used in neuroscience with the way I&amp;#39;m searching :P can anyone help me out here? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first question is more neuroscience but the second is more psychology so sorry if there&amp;#39;s a way to add two flairs and I didn&amp;#39;t realize it lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
