  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe&amp;#39;s Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we&amp;#39;ve never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions. We are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Jane Rigby, NASA astrophysicist and Webb Operations Project Scientist (JR)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Alexandra Lockwood, Space Telescope Science Institute project scientist and Webb communications lead (AL)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Stephan Birkmann, European Space Agency scientist for Webb&amp;#39;s NIRSpec camera (SB)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Karl Saad, Canadian Space Agency project manager (KS)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dr. Sarah Lipscy, Ball Aerospace deputy director of New Business, Civil Space (SL)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mei Li Hey, Northrop Grumman mechanical design engineer (MLH)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA branch head for the Planetary Systems Laboratory (SDG)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be on at 1 p.m. ET (18 UT), ask us anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1470861166503096320?s=20\"&gt;Proof!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/NASA\"&gt;/u/NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
