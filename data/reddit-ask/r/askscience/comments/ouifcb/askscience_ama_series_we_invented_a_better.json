The improvements include increased editing efficiency enabling previously unfeasible large edits (1000s of base pairs) at a clinically viable level, in addition to lower cellular toxicity. Our Cas9-HR Platform represents an exciting step for gene editing.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to use our Cas9-HR Platform to develop therapeutics, specifically treatments for genetic diseases that are caused by a diverse number of mutations. Since existing high-efficiency CRISPR technologies are limited to small edits (1-50 base pairs), we believe this is an area where we can make a significant impact.</p>\n\n<p>Answering questions today are the two co-founders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chris Hackley, PhD, CEO: <a href=\"/u/chris-hackley-chr\">/u/chris-hackley-chr</a>: Chris has 11+ years experience in a variety of biological areas, with particular expertise in protein and genetic engineering. Chris earned his BS in MCD Biology from UCSB, and PhD in protein engineering from NYU.</li>\n<li>Richard Gavan, MSc, CTO: <a href=\"/u/richard-gavan-chr\">/u/richard-gavan-chr</a>: Richard has 8+ years experience consulting in IT for the life sciences industry. Richard earned his BA in Philosophy and Psychology from UCSB, and MSc in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (OMSCS).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll start answering questions at 19:00 UTC (8pm BST, 3pm EDT, 12pm PDT) on Friday, July 30th.
