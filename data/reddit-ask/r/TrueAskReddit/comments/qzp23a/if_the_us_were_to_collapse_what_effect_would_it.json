How would other countries react? A lot of countries like China and Russia would probably feel emboldened. Various conflicts like Israel-Middle East, North Korea-South Korea, India-Pakistan could flare up and potentially lead to nuclear war. Russia will set it&#39;s eyes on Eastern Europe and China will try assert itself as the new global superpower. Europe would have a lot of now defunct American military bases in their countries leaving them exposed.</p>\n\n<p>Would it be a humanitarian disaster? The US economy is 15% of the global economy. Could this mean mass famines and economic collapse sweep the planet? </p>\n\n<p>We are so used to a world where America is calling the shots that we never stopped to imagine what the world would be like if the US suddenly lost all it&#39;s power. I personally think that the earth would go into a dark age. A wild west where countries try to fill in the power vacuum which leads to war and destruction, possibly on a scale never before seen.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
