The reason i&amp;#39;m asking is because I remember visiting my parents home country and almost every day a guy came driving down our neighborhood ringing his bell, selling the most common fruits and vegetables, parking at the end of the neighborhood. (I think, it might also been once a week, I dont remember). What was really great was how convenient it was especially for my mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a side note there are also other benefits. I think this is also much more enviromentally friendly and healthy, in terms of simply buying what you actually need and it being readily available. This reminds me of food deserts around the U.S, how many of neighborhoods dont have access to healthy foods nearby. Just an example of how our enviroment can affect us. Another example is the city of SAN CRISTÓBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico, the capital of Coca Cola consumption, where people have access to it everywhere they go. (Even dedicated small neighbbhodd shops just selling Coca Cola)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
