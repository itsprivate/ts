I only began masturbating when I turned 19 and that wasn&#39;t because of any religious upbrining or abuse, I just didn&#39;t know how to and porn didn&#39;t work.</p>\n\n<p>Even though I enjoy masturbating in the moment, I always get tired and very depressed afterwards and regret. Not because I feel guilt but because I feel that it&#39;s wasted energy. </p>\n\n<p>About a month ago, I purchase cyproterone acetate (the anti-androgen drug), and tried some to experiment with a low sex drive. After a few days I noticed a significant decrease in sexual arousal. A month later, it&#39;s almost entirely gone.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s a bad thing at all but many of my friends are surprised why I&#39;d want to do this. </p>\n\n<p>In a way I feel that though sex and masturbation are amazing, they&#39;re &#39;futile&#39; desires that never get satisfied. Sensations like hunger and thirst are necessary for survival and will cause death if not fulfilled. They also aren&#39;t that hard to get. But horniness just seems like a powerful sensation which won&#39;t at all affect someone physically (perhaps mentally) if gone unfulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else think the same way?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
