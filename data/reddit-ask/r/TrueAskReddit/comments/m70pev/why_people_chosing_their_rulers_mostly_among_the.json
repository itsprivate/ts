All their campaigns would be based on simply who they are. \n\nI am not saying that people should vote for everyone who happened to be poor  - but it seems weird that people who chose to refuse money and power for various reasons (especially if those reasons are providing unpaid help for other humans) are not the ones everyone wants to see in the ruling posts.
