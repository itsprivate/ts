It’s like my whole world view and sense of self has been forced to adjust rapidly and it’s been more than I can take. Plus, my family looks down on me. I see a therapist but she doesn’t really get it and if I tell others about this they think I’m being a snob or something but it’s a huge shock to go from complete security and endless possibilities to the opposite. Can anyone share their stories? It would mean the world to me.\n\nThank you",
