If this were a business decision made with smart people, or with some game theory involved in the strategizing, there would be related costs and benefits associated with doing something right? Have we assumed that by throwing these resources at it we can tackle covid by a certain time? For example, maybe 4 years of spending and disruptions to the economy are worth keeping it under control, but at some point it&amp;#39;s not? Or is it actually a sort of situation where, no matter the cost... it&amp;#39;s better to get it under control? Or is it relatively not that costly so far (not like, say, WW2)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
