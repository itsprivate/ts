No matter how much they help the human race, they will eventually be forgotten. I have had this thought for quite some time and I wasn't able to find a satisfactory answer. I checked through other reddit posts, and they all said something like \"enjoy life\" or \"there is no point.\" I really want to calm my mind and that's why I ask. My life is decent, so I don't really know why I am so focused on this thought. It might be because report cards recently came out, but let's not go into detail on that.\n\nAlso, if you're not enjoying life, then why live? Many adults have barely any free time. They're always working and they can't do the things they like. So then, what's the point? You get around 80 years to live. In the first 25, you go to school, college, university, etc. In the last 20, you become really weak, fragile, and won't be able to do much. The middle years are when you can enjoy must, but it looks like adults have to work a lot and don't have much time to enjoy.\n\nI don't really see the point in living. As for my future, nothing interests me. I find nearly everything boring. It's hard to explain. I am sorry if some of what I said is unclear.",
