All my friends(straight guys and gals) say she&#39;s probably trans and i think so too but I&#39;m afraid to ask. If she happens to be trans that wouldn&#39;t be an issue for me but I&#39;ve heard most trans women keep their penises and sadly that will be a deal breaker for me. So how do I ask this question without offending her because I don&#39;t want things to go any further without me knowing this and also to avoid any future akward moments if it turns out she has a Penis.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
