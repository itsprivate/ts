Both times she has been passed out on her bed or couch, all of her stove burners on, clearly breathing but messed up enough to not be woken by a very loud smoke alarm and a stranger in her apartment calling out to her from a few feet away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a weird apartment complex where I don&amp;#39;t know the landlord and only put in work orders on a web form, which basically is just sent to the most incompetent repairmen I have ever met, so I don&amp;#39;t know how helpful that would be. I&amp;#39;m worried for my cat I don&amp;#39;t want to leave her home alone anymore for fear of this neighbor staring a serious fire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas of what I could do about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just called emergency services and a wellness check is going to be performed shortly. Thanks for all the responses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
