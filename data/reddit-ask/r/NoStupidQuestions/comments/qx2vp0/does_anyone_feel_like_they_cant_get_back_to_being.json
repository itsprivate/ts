I don&#39;t feel like I can just get up and go to a bar like I used to, it feels difficult psychologically even to just go out for a walk like I used to.  I can&#39;t do my travel plans because it looks like there&#39;s a fourth wave coming.  It&#39;s like I left my brain in the garage too long and now I can&#39;t start it up again.  I also think it&#39;s harder at meet up groups and stuff, because other people have also changed in the pandemic and socialising and making real friendships just seems beyond people&#39;s capability now, like everyone just wants to complain and then go home early.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else feel like this?  Are there any big or small ways to get going again?  (Please don&#39;t say volunteering, I&#39;m a full time carer and I&#39;m burned tf out.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
