They&amp;#39;ve successfully moved to the moon on their own accord, claiming no nation but that of humankind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it illegal? If so, under who&amp;#39;s jurisdiction would this fall? I&amp;#39;d assume the easiest thing to do would be to stop the resupply ships and cut off food/oxygen, but let&amp;#39;s assume the ships launch from random locations that can&amp;#39;t be found until they&amp;#39;re already launched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would someone try to bring them back to Earth? What if they refuse to go back? I think it would be a cool movie idea but wonder what would ACTUALLY happen or if there&amp;#39;s a protocol for something like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Folks are pointing out that it&amp;#39;s not possible to build a rocket undetected. This is a very fair point. For the sake of fun, let&amp;#39;s assume a tech billionaire with existing rockets and infrastructure goes rogue and stays on the moon indefinitely, lying about what was supposed to be a three hour tour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
