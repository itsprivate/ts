I&#39;ve seen others get irate or upset over &quot;swearing&quot; too.</p>\n\n<p>To me swear words are just that, they&#39;re words, they hold no inherent power or added nastiness. I <em>am</em> trying to stop using so called swear words because my parents don&#39;t much like it (I don&#39;t live at home and I am old enough and ugly enough to look after myself) but it frustrates me to no end that they would allow something so stupid to have such control over their emotions and feelings, I don&#39;t understand why anyone would allow anyone else to control their mental state in such a way with such a simple thing as saying &quot;fuck&quot; or &quot;shit&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Words only hold what power we give them, so why do people give such words the power to offend when they can choose not to? Why would anyone <em>choose</em> to get pissy over a 4 letter arrangement that holds no inherent power on its own?</p>\n\n<p>It is incredibly frustrating that I can&#39;t get my head around this, it seems inherently ridiculous to grant others the power to control your emotional state so easily, please help. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone that has commented, I genuinely really appreciate the time folk are taking to explain this to me and to challenge my views, it has helped me massively! Special thanks to <a href=\"/u/Freepurrs\">/u/Freepurrs</a> who has managed to nail it down to (at least in one major part) a matter of perspective, I genuinely believe I am getting a much better understanding here and that goes a long way to being able to break this habit and understand why people react the way they do to words that, to me, seem completely harmless.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
