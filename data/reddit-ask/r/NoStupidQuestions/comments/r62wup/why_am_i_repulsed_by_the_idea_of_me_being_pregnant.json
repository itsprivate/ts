When I was little and used to play house, I never wanted to pretend to be pregnant because I thought it was repulsive. Even seeing pictures of my mom pregnant brought me deep shame and sadness for both me and her. I thought that I’d eventually outgrow it but I never did. I’ve had two dream about being pregnant this week and both have been traumatizing and disgusting. It was awful, and I think it’s because I still see myself as a child (idk just a guess). I don’t want to see myself in that way, and I don’t understand why. Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
