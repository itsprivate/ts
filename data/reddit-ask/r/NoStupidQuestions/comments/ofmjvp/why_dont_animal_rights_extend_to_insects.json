My host mother when I was an exhange student was a fierce animal rights activist but what baffled me was how her feelings towards animal life didn&#39;t extend to insects. When she saw some weird looking spider she would just smash it without thinking twice and I started seeing it all around with animal rights activism is that no one protests for pests no one cares when mosquitoes and ants are sprayed dead and rats are also poisoned. Why doesn&#39;t they care about other species that are pests?. I know it sounds like I&#39;m trolling but this is genuine question. I know pests make life difficult but why can&#39;t they preach about finding ways of making pests go away without killing them?.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
