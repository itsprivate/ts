I tried not to cry, but his breathing was so laboured, I knew he was suffering. We then put him down, he passed in my arms.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards I learned that his lungs were filling with fluid. Before I got there, he was anxious, stressed, coughing and gasping for every breath. I had no idea, when I got there, he was so calm with me, and never coughed once. And he lay in my lap, a severley disadvantageous position for breathing, which most likely caused a lot of distress, just to calm me down and give me one final snuggle.</p>\n\n<p>Fuck man, I loved that dog</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
