When I arrived, the parking lot was packed and my reserved spot in front of my unit was taken by someone that didn’t even have a parking pass for the facility. I wasn’t about to go door to door asking everyone who’s car it was, and the owner was no where in sight. When I moved in (3 days ago) my leasing manger handed me a tow card that she said I could use if someone was parked in my spot. So upon seeing a car in my space I parked in visitor parking, went into my apartment, and called the tow company. Their car was picked up within 30 minutes and no owner ever came out to dispute the tow. My family thinks I was being a bit hasty but idk was I supposed to just wait until they theoretically moved?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
