We were walking home from dinner and unbeknownst to me she put a few white tic tacs in her mouth - she pretended to sneeze and spit a couple teeth out. It shocked me for half a second and took my brain a bit longer to figure out what happened and by that point she was laughing hysterically. She loved the prank so much.</p>\n\n<p>I of course pointed out that she just started a new phase in our relationship - a pranks phase. Her face immediately dropped as she realized our unspoken truce of not pranking each other has been broken. </p>\n\n<p>Enough time has passed and I want to “get her back.” I want something as benign and quick as hers, and I can’t think of friggin anything. Any master pranksters here that can help me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
