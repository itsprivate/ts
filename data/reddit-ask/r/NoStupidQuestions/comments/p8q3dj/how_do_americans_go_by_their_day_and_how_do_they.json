For eg: you want to drink water. Do you have water stored in a jug or do you directly fill your glass from a water purifier system? Please mention any other way, if there is any.</li>\n<li>What do people eat? I don&#39;t mean special dishes, just NORMAL food. Hell, tell me what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday.</li>\n<li>Do people use forks and spoon for everything they eat?</li>\n<li>Does everyone wash their own plates, or does one person in the house do everyone&#39;s? Also, what is the function of a dishwasher? Is it better to clean by hand or a dishwasher?</li>\n<li>Do most people live in houses or in apartments? Are people who live in apartments considered poor?</li>\n<li>When you go to bath, what do you do to the clothes you were wearing earlier? Do you throw them in the laundry or do you wash them with you in the bathroom then and there? Does everyone wash their own clothes or does one person in the house do everyone&#39;s?</li>\n<li>Do you have certain clothes you wear while sleeping?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have many more questions, but I will stop. I hope these questions don&#39;t alarm anyone, please, I am just overly curious and I don&#39;t mean any harm.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
