If someone is on a scale of 1-10 is a 5, then they will date someone who is a 5 and maybe a 4 or 6. A 10 will date another 10 or a 9, and a 1 will date another 1 or 2. And it is unfortunate, but finding someone physically attractive is an important part of a relationship, no happy relationship will be one where the other person says &quot;yes I find them physically revolting but he is so sweet&quot; </p>\n\n<p>So if you can&#39;t choose who you&#39;re attracted to, how do you find happiness in your life if you are a 4 who is attracted to 8s? I hear people say to lower your standards and stuff like that, but how do you just simply change what you find attractive to be happier?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
