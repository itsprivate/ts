But now, I’m really regretting it, I don’t like it at all, and derive no pleasure from it. It feels like words. He’s asked me a couple of times if I like certain things but words it in a way that’s hard to refuse like putting “right?” at the end so I tend to say yes. He’s asked me to say a lot of things I don’t want to say and when I say I don’t want to, he says, now I’m turned off and looks at me like it’s all my fault. I don’t know what to do now. I love him which is why I’m willing to put up with it but at this point he says it every time and it really bothers me. What should I do?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
