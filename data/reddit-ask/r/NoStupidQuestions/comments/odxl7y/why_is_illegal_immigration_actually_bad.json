The other person usually responds accordingly, but I’m just sitting there like “okay... and?”. Like people say “it depends on the immigrants, if they’re willing to work hard, it’s fine”. But why does that matter though? They’re just changing where they are located. What’s so bad about that?    </p>\n\n<p>I get the whole “you don’t want a stranger walking into your house, do you?”. Yeah of course because it’s my house. But is an entire country really the property of anybody in particular? Who actually OWNS a country? It seems a bit weird to make that comparison because if somebody illegally immigrates to “my” country, is everyone in “my” country supposed to collectively feel estranged like I am when a stranger walks into my house?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
