I’ve rarely if ever experienced this before tonight. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I was reading this self help article and suddenly I felt horrible about myself and then extremely agitated in this intense weird way that would not go away!</p>\n\n<p>But I can’t pinpoint what exactly I was feeling. The best I can explain it is that it’s like a kind of rage, but it’s not directed at anyone or anything. I want to hit things. Crawl out of my skin. My body is extremely tense. I can barely tolerate my mom’s friendly questions from the kitchen. I want to scream at her for asking if I want soup but I know I can’t. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not justified or righteous anger. I’m not even annoyed at anyone FOR anything. Just them bring them makes me irrationally rageful.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this is some of the parts from the advice column that hurt the most. </p>\n\n<p>“That Guy was never going to give me the time of day. He mattered too much to me; he could feel it. And also, honestly, he was into women who had <em>better things to do with their time than hang on his every word.</em>” (My reaction: everyone can sense that I’m pathetic, I have nothing better to do, most other women are better people and this more attractive) </p>\n\n<p>“He also had lots of projects, lots of adventures, lots of pressing shit to do. <em>I was too busy daydreaming and feeling rejected. But he was busy doing things that felt important to him.</em> Focusing on something outside of yourself is hot. It’s hot to work that hard.” (My reaction: I’m pathetic and not worthy, no one could like someone like that, like me)</p>\n\n<p>“You need to focus all this swirling, intense, imaginative mind-fuckery into something bold and bright and <em>useful.</em>” (My reaction: I am useless, I bring nothing into the world, have no value, waste of space) </p>\n\n<p>“<em>You can’t become a full person</em> until you learn to turn off the <em>pretty fantasies</em> in your brain.” (My reaction: I’m not a full person) </p>\n\n<p>“<em>You can’t hang out with people and have a good time until you show them respect.</em> That means you have to <em>stop putting yourself at the center of every picture.</em> (My reaction: I don’t respect people, I put myself at the center of every picture.)</p>\n\n<p>“That means you have to appreciate pictures even when you’re not in them. <em>Once you care about yourself, you’ll have room to care about other people</em> — <em>as human beings</em>, not as mirrors or escape fantasies or ciphers.” (My reaction: I don’t care about other people and can’t until I care about myself, which I worry will not be for a long time; I don’t see others as human beings)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
