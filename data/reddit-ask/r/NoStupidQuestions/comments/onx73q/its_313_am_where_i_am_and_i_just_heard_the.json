I thought I&#39;ll just deal with whatever it is tomorrow morning but then it happened again around 3:12 waking me up and again a few moments later. That last one took my breath away it was so damn loud and scary. It scared the shit out of me and I&#39;m worried. The first time, I thought it was a big branch fell and hit the front porch but 3 times within an hour? It&#39;s too late/early to call a friend. What to do?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
