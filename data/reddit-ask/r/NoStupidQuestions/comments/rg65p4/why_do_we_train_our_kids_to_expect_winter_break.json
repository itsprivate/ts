The suggestions to &amp;quot;work harder so you can afford it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;be a teacher&amp;quot; make no sense. If everybody worked harder, then we would all still be in the same place. I make enough to take the time off, and I get 6 official weeks of vacation, and I live in North America, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I expect everybody to be a be to afford to do the same since we simply don&amp;#39;t have an economy structured to allow for everyone to get what they want if they work hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I guess my edit answered my own question.
