While it only applies to public areas, it&#39;s still incredibly invasive. </p>\n\n<p>It would be really cool if there was some law that required you to gather consent. Something that accounted for and accommodated security footage but required people to stop recording if you said &quot;I don&#39;t consent to being recorded&quot;. What happened to the whole &quot;respecting the privacy of individuals&quot; thing?</p>\n\n<p>Edits to clarify:</p>\n\n<p>• The point is to have some recourse if you get recorded and have your reputation ruined for whatever reason. Proven false narratives regarding recordings have ruined reputations and it could help  people with mental disorders that cause them to act irrationally to have recourse for their reputation damage as a result.</p>\n\n<p>• Laws like this exist in other countries such as Germany. Private residences can&#39;t even be recorded and don&#39;t show up on Google street view when zooming in.</p>\n\n<p>• We can make provisions to prevent exploitation by public officials and officers of the law so that they can still be held accountable for behavior. </p>\n\n<p>• Accommodations can be made to make sure this law still allows for security footage to be recorded, such as only being enforceable if the footage is posted online or publicly shared after consent has been withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>• We can make provisions to allow footage of active crimes or even hate speech to be posted without consent so that those people can be held accountable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
