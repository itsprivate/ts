I should have known better but I for some odd reason just ignored the red flags and went straight in. I guess the money blinded my view or something. I will totally accept you all calling me dumb. I accepted a $3,000 check from this man and deposited it. I was in contact with him back and fourth, all I gave him was my first and last name, which bank I used, and my email. I even sent him a screenshot of the check pending. Thankfully my bank saw through the scam and stopped it from going into my account, they also put my account on sort of a lockdown type thing (I forgot what they called it) and they told the police. Totally embarrassing and caused me a minor panic attack. But even with them doing that am I ok? Like am I not gonna go to prison for a forged check? And is he going to be able to do some funky business with my account? \nI wasn’t sure if this should go into asking legal questions or not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
