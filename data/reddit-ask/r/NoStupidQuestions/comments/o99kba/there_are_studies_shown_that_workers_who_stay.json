However, why is it that if I work at Company A and get paid $100k a year, then I can switch to Company B at the same title and get paid 120k, and then Company A will backfill that position with a salary of 120k? It makes no sense to me. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if you stay at a company awhile you have SOO much institutional knowledge which is helpful at your role and saves the company way more time. You would have to pay lower costs for recruiting and signing bonuses if you just give people drastically bigger raises. I feel that if I have 5 years of experience at Company A and someone else has 5 years of experience at a different company, but just got hired at Company A, I should be paid more since I&#39;ve stayed at the company longer and am better at that specific job. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone else have a good counter to this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
