  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I know he only dated me for sex. I was very experienced and he was raised in a conservative family. His mother is a scientist and the father an engineer. This guy is also working in nuclear field and is highly respected. He is 26 and already has a well paying job. Anyway, he was career focused and only wanted someone to bang. He never said it like this, but I knew it. He has always been mommas good boy, good looking, well mannered and to be honest girls liked him a lot. We started sleeping togheter last year. I am 21 and work at the local supermarket. ( I need to say this because I want to make sure why I feel weak comparing to them)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I got pregnant and he became almost hysterical that his mother will kill him. I thought he is so childish but somehow I thought the problem was simply that he was not ready for this. But... he told his best friend his problem was me. He did not want his mother to know he fathered a child with a whore ( and here I will quote) that was used more than google. I decided to simply told him to f... off and give birth to my baby. I am not very concerned. I know I will be a good mother and I will love him( I already know it is a boy) But his mother found out and called me. He gave her my number and she called me a hoe for seducing her son. Nothing was his fault, only mine and she somehow forbid him to talk to me anymore and she is going to take over. Her request is that after I give birth I MUST give the baby to her and dissapear. She offered me money. I will not that this. I love my baby. I tried to call him and beg him to make her leave me alone but he blocked my number and though a friend told me he is very sorry but he cannot say anything to his mom. Now, I have no one. My mom doesnt care about me and my father is ill. I have nothing and no one. My question is... can they actually take my baby from me? It would be illegal, no? </p>\n\n<p>I know where he works. It is a well secured plant because of the field, but I could try. Would it be worth it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
