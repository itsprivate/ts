  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother and I are separated and recently I&amp;#39;ve been getting him for 6-9 days at a time after not really being too active or involved before. I&amp;#39;m in his life now and plan to keep being. It&amp;#39;s great to teach him, watch him learn and become smarter. Since I only have one bedroom for myself right now (sharing the house with family), he sleeps in my bed. I usually get the half towards the floor and he&amp;#39;ll get the side towards the wall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the intimate bonding time we have when I&amp;#39;m putting him down for naps and bedtime. I like to cuddle him while he falls asleep (I know the mother sleeps with him too) and I also like to give him lots of kisses throughout the day. I just want to show my love for him, make him feel love and I genuinely feel happy with him here. He&amp;#39;s a cute, strong, smart lil man lol &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also tough on him at times and it&amp;#39;s kind of a way to kind of connect with him and just be with him. I know I won&amp;#39;t be able to forever, I&amp;#39;ll have to teach him to sleep on his own as he gets older, but he just turned 2 a few months ago and he&amp;#39;s still learning. It just feels great to be in his life like this and being here for him. I love him but I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m being overly affectionate and clingy to him? He seems to like being in my arms and watching TV or just sleeping and I like being here to protect him and make him feel safe and happy. I&amp;#39;m also 25 and deal with some separation shit myself lol. Am I in the wrong or weird for this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
