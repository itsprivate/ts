Me being a kid and meeting a pregnant woman for the first time, I assumed either that's just the way they smelt, or it was a coincidence. \n    \nAs I grew up I met very few pregnant woman face to face, I had a very isolated childhood, but I did notice that smell only appeared when I was in a crowded place, and frequently I would be able to spot a pregnant woman somewhere in the crowd, or a woman with a baby. \n\nI always assumed that the reason nobody mentioned it was because it would be rude, but as I've gotten older I realize that I have never in my life heard anyone mention it. Not even an acknowledgment of the smell. This is strange to me considering it is a VERY strong smell. Virtually any room with a pregnant woman in it has smelt like that throughout, and considering its kind of a gross smell, I can't imagine EVERYONE staying silent about it.\n\nI brought it up to some friends recently, and they had no idea what I was talking about. This prompted me to Google it, I found nothing regarding this, many articles spoke of increased B.O but this smell is completely unique, not like B.O. \n\nI justified it as a coincidence until just a few days ago, I was in a Starbucks staring out the window, waiting for my drink. When I smelt the smell, I turned around and in the doorway was a pregnant woman. This confirmed it for me, I now have no uncertainty that all pregnant women smell like this. But NOBODY I've spoken to can relate.\n\nI come to you Reddit, please tell me that my super power isn't to smell when someone is pregnant. Everybody's just being polite right?",
