Are posters still a thing? Reason I ask is I saw a SportsCenter tweet about one basketball player putting another basketball player “on a poster.” For those who do not follow the basketballs, this means the former player dunked viciously on the latter player, usually with the first player making an expression like &amp;gt;:O and the second one being more like (:o and the implication is that this scene could, in theory, be captured and marketed as a poster for youths to put on their bedroom walls. It just made me wonder if the term is outdated. Like if it shouldn’t be replaced with like “GIF’D” something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
