I have spent an almost inifinite amount of hours in my bed struggling with pain, systemic infections, and depression. My only escape was listening music thinking \"this too shall pass\".\n\nI'm finally about cured now at 25 (haven't had issues in 4 months for the first time) but I can't get disability help here because I'm cured.\n\nI never never had any job, I don't have skills nor experience, nor friends, nor driver's license. I have completed one year of college in engineering (chemical) with satisfying results before I got ill. I had good grades in high school. I failed 3 times my 2nd year of engineering school because I was too fucking sick (and I really was, was in hospital for 6 months on the first year) so in my country they won't allow me to apply again even though I have proofs I was seriously sick.\n\nI have a bit of inheritance money (20k$) on which I'm living at the moment. I can't get governmental help anymore because of being too old.\n\nI wished to become an engineer but it feels like it's too late and when I am at the schools won't take me anymore because of age limit at 25 so maybe I could consider moving abroad if I spoke the language. Ageism is known to be strong here and I can't find success story of anyone entering a job at more than 30 which would be the age I could complete a degree by.\n\nI have applied to some entry level jobs (50+ resume sent) but I'm getting discarded every time. Never got an interview. Basically here the government will fund entry level jobs for people under 25 so you needed to start before that.\n\nI'd like to do something interesting with my life and not be stuck with entry level jobs forever.\n\nI can learn a language if needed. I speak Spanish and English.\n\nWhere do I start ? Do you know any country that would be welcoming and without massive ageism ? Any job or sector which would be welcoming?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : I hate anything IT, I tried to get into it some months ago as I was getting better, but I really hate that.",
