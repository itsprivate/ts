So that would not be a good example for many reasons (I see that now, it was just the first that came to my mind).</p>\n\n<p>The best (or maybe the most convenient, at least) example would be Youtube. There&#39;s just this aura about the comments and videos uploaded many years ago that immediately gives away it&#39;s not a recent one. It&#39;s hard to describe it, but the content back then seems to have been more &quot;innocent&quot; and more &quot;spontaneous&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing them makes me think that we&#39;ve passed some period of &quot;innonence&quot; when everybody was just enjoying themselves and didn&#39;t really stop to think about that. Therefore, some of those comments/videos (like &quot;Numa Numa&quot; by Dork Daily or &quot;Me at the Zoo&quot; by jawed) just feel weird.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just me, but I get the impression that the Internet has become more &quot;direct&quot; and less &quot;spontaneous&quot;. In some ways that makes it less infantile, but in others, it loses some of its charm.</p>\n\n<p>Hope I am making sense here.</p>\n\n<p>Edit nr 2: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qtAWgPGxo5w\">https://youtu.be/qtAWgPGxo5w</a></p>\n\n<p>And check the 11-year old comment by Jared Viazanko.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc\">https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
