Recently, he went on a vacation with his friends and his friends got super drunk and horny. My boyfriend was tipsy and he was also horny. One of his friend which is a girl, wanted to have sex or something. So my boyfriend decided to cuddle with her telling her this is the closest she can get to sex. During the cuddling, he got a boner from that but he did not cheat on me or something. The next morning, they cuddled again and he got a boner again.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The next day, he told me about this. To me, cuddling another girl other than your girlfriend is cheating and he knows that. So, I reacted differently and I started crying. I explained how I felt. But he said he had no choice. And he also told me it was his body reacting. Is this normal? for a guy to cuddle with their girl friends other than their girl friend? And is it normal for them to get boner? Or am I just overreacting?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
