I said I wasn’t really attracted to darker women, though I have been a few times but it’s rare.</p>\n\n<p>She damn near threw her drink on me, called me a racist and stormed out. I was really caught off guard. Everybody told me I didn’t do anything wrong but I left shortly after just to clear the air.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> After seeing many posts and all different takes, I just wanted to say thanks. Also, It’s not just skin tone I guess. African features? I don’t know how to tell someone “I’m not attracted to the facial structure of most African women” so just saying skin tone seems like the easiest and nicest way. I don’t know. </p>\n\n<p>Also, there is BEAUTIFUL black women. The musician Megan Thee Stallion without make-up is one of the most naturally pretty women I’ve ever seen. Her body, her face, her hair when she wears it naturally. I’d love nothing more than to have a bunch of little mixed babies with her lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
