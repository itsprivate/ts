My neighbor won't stop buying junk BMWs, I am not exaggerating the dude has like 23 of them, and takes almost all of the parking on our street. They aren't nice cars at all.

I'd love it if he kept them ALL on his lawn or in front of his house. But I'm annoyed that I and my family have to walk about 2 blocks away just to park(we have multiple working adults in our household and I let my elderly parents get the two driveway spots). His cars seem to have up to date tags (although I am not sure how legitimate they are) and street sweeping isn't really enforced. I tried talking to him but he's a huge narcissist and does not give a fuck. I've tried reporting \"abandoned vehicle\" but he just shuffles them around. It's been like this for years.. what can I do if none of the legal methods work? Please help me.",
