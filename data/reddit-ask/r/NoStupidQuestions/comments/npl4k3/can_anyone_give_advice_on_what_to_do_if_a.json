I'd love it if he kept them ALL on his lawn or in front of his house. But I'm annoyed that I and my family have to walk about 2 blocks away just to park(we have multiple working adults in our household and I let my elderly parents get the two driveway spots). His cars seem to have up to date tags (although I am not sure how legitimate they are) and street sweeping isn't really enforced. I tried talking to him but he's a huge narcissist and does not give a fuck. I've tried reporting \"abandoned vehicle\" but he just shuffles them around. It's been like this for years.. what can I do if none of the legal methods work? Please help me.",
