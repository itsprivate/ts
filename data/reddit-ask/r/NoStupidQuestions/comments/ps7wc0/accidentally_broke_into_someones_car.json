I drive a silver Nissan Altima. I get out to hand the customer their food, and I walk back to what I think is my car, and it wouldn’t unlock. I have Triple A Roadside Assistance so I called them to unlock the door, and when I got in it I realized that it wasn’t my car. This car was literally the EXACT same as my car, from the color, model, and year. My car was parked 2 spaces down but there was a big black truck in between the 2 cars so I couldn’t see my car. I didn’t take anything out of the other person’s car, and I called the police to let them know what happened. This was a complete accident. Do you think charges will be pressed against me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
