I got an email three days ago (didn't even open it until now, I because I rarely check my email), from a person who I don't recognize. They said said that they hacked my phone, stole my contacts, filmed me masturbating, and will be sending it to all my contacts unless I give them like $1500.\n\nThey sent a google doc outlining extra details, like how they are demanding the money through bitcoin. At the end of the doc, they said that they would receive a notification of when I opened it and that I would have to send the money within 96 hours or they would send the video to all my contacts. It was probably dumb for me to open their doc at all, but it was 3am and I was hungover so not really thinking clearly.\n\nSo I think this is probably a scam, but I'm also pretty scared? I have no idea how this guy got my email. Ultimately, there's no way I'm sending him the money because I don't even have it. But I'm like, is there actually a chance that he filmed me and could send it to people? Does he actually have my contacts?\n\nI would appreciate any help I can get",
