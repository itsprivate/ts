Now that I have my license my friends have started saying that it’s super weird driving with me because I don’t talk, and won’t let them play music. I thought that everybody had that same rule growing up, but none of my friends had that rule so idk. I feel like it’s definitely quite common, maybe my friends parents just didn’t enforce the rule that often? Is this a common rule or is it a bit weird?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
