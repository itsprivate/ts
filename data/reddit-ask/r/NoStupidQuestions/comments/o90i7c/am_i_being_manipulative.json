We had no common friends. I ended up finding her account through our program&#39;s student Instagram page where she was featured that same week I was looking for her. Through that, I found her Spotify linked in her profile. From both of those platforms, I found out that we both play guitar and and like the same music. Anyway, the whole semester I was looking for ways to talk to her, but the prof had turned off the chat so I couldn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>The day before the last day of class, I posted a song on my story that I knew she also liked. I followed her when the class ended, and to my surprise she replied to my story right away saying how much she loved that album less than an hour after I followed her. The next week, I posted another song that I knew she liked, she responded again. Now I feel kinda guilty because I feel like maybe I&#39;m being manipulative and creepy? Should I stop?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
