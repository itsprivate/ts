My family is dirt poor and we just got kicked off of Medicare.\nFuneral costs are going to be a bitch and none of my family can help pay for it. I&amp;#39;d be asking for too much.\nI hung up on the doctor because I needed a moment to myself. Now I&amp;#39;m stuck in the bathroom crying on the floor because I can&amp;#39;t handle this. I&amp;#39;m having an anxiety attack, I have no parents. She was all I had left.\nPlease tell me where to go?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
