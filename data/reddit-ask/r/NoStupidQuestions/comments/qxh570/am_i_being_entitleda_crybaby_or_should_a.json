And not only that, but they will spill coffee all over the keurig that it&#39;s my job to clean up, my job to refill the water in it that I don&#39;t use, basically clean up after these adults for messes that I&#39;m not making. I feel like that&#39;s a bit degrading, but this is also my first office job so I don&#39;t know if this is the norm. There&#39;s also tons of other little minor tasks they have me do that literally takes more work to ask me to do for them than it would if they just did it themselves. And I&#39;m starting to get really annoyed by it, and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m the problem or not.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Am I overreacting?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
