She&#39;s isolated and alone most of the time and can&#39;t drive herself anymore. Would it be weird if I offered to be her friend? She likes to talk a lot and reminds me of my grandparents and I like listening to their stories. She said she just wants someone to visit because she doesn&#39;t have anyone. I don&#39;t know any details.</p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t have many friends (2 + my bf) and most of my family is super far and I can&#39;t visit with them often. I have a difficult time socializing because I don&#39;t talk often and it puts people off. But she&#39;s super nice in the office and I always chat with her before and after her appointments. She wanted me to be her caretaker (mainly driving her around) but at the time I didn&#39;t have my own car to be able to do that. </p>\n\n<p>So now I have come to reddit because I&#39;m bad at social norms and am wondering if it would be inappropriate for me to offer my information and offer to be her friend. Thanks in advance!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you everyone who replied. I&#39;m gonna make sure it&#39;s fine with my boss first and discuss it more with my bf (mainly so he knows where I am if I leave). She has said she&#39;s lonely and doesn&#39;t have anyone to visit, and I know how much it sucks being isolated and not having anyone to talk to. I&#39;ll post an update if things go well and put the link here :) thanks again!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
