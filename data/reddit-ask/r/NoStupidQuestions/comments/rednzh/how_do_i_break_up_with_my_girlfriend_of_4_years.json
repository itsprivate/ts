For various reasons I know she is not the one I want to spend the rest of my life with but I really don’t want to hurt her. She is 23 but we are at super different stages in our life. I really just want to do my own thing for awhile and not have to weigh anyone else’s opinion while I’m starting to get my life together (move away, buying a house etc.). I feel very selfish for wanting to break things off. I’m not sure how to go about this so naturally I will ask strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
