You don&amp;#39;t have that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no clue what to say. I&amp;#39;ve never had that. There&amp;#39;s no words in here, I&amp;#39;m pretty damn sure I&amp;#39;d know if there were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is haunting me. Holy shit, I need answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Asked another friend, she says she &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; hears words, and couldn&amp;#39;t imagine it being &amp;quot;quiet.&amp;quot; She described it as similar to &amp;quot;a friend watching a movie who won&amp;#39;t shut the fuck up&amp;quot; and oh my god this is confusing me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Okay, not sure if I should trust what the second friend says because she just told me she sometimes thinks in the voice of Sans from Undertale&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: Asked my mother of all people. She says I probably do have it, and that it just goes so fast I don&amp;#39;t recognize it. Ha, ha, ha. Hilarious. ._.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
