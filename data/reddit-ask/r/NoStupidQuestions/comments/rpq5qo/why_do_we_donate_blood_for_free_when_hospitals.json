I guess that&amp;#39;s pretty dumb, because how else do hospitals get blood?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever somebody desperately needs treatment in America, the first thought is how much it&amp;#39;s going to cost. The hospital and the insurance companies argue, and you may not even get the best treatment because your policy holder wants to save a few bucks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when any sort of responsibility is placed on the individual, all of sudden it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;America NEEDS your blood, aren&amp;#39;t you going to donate?&amp;quot; If people need my blood to live, and I&amp;#39;m giving it to you for free, then why are they allowed to use it as leverage to put someone in a lifetime of medical debt? I know a blood bag alone probably wouldn&amp;#39;t do that, but it definitely contributes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I don&amp;#39;t want to be paid for blood, I just want it to be given at cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
