Little did I know she&amp;#39;s been making videos on the hard drive, saying crap like &amp;quot;Like and Subscribe&amp;quot; lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I do what the streamers do? I.e. Record the screen while also video recording you. What software do I need? Will a Ryzen 3600 and a 1660 be up to the job?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want her to be putting videos out to the public at this age, but is there like a way to make your you tube videos private?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help, I&amp;#39;m good with PCs when it comes to building or gaming, I just don&amp;#39;t have a clue where to start when it comes to streaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
