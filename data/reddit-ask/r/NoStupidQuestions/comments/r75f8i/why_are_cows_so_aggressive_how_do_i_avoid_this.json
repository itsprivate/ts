They didn&amp;#39;t have calves, I didn&amp;#39;t come close or split them from their group. I didn&amp;#39;t run or move in any kind of anxious way, I didn&amp;#39;t turn and run when it charged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole issue seems really dumb to me, I&amp;#39;ve worked with other livestock (sheep and rams, horses etc) and I&amp;#39;ve been around my fair share of dangerous dogs but for some reason cattle seem unpredictable on a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not willing to stop walking on the off chance there are cows. They huddle around the footpaths causing us to have to walk through bogs etc to maintain a safe distance around them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the local farmers and they treat their animals well, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s anything to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
