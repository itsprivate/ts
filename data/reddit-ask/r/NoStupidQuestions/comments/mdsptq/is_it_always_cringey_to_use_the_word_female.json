I mean..is it just me? \n\nI thought maybe it didn't have anything to do with man vs. male, I thought maybe \"man writer\" just sounded weird to me because my 'default' is--unfortunately--male and I just feel weird clarifying it, if that makes sense? But no. Male writer sounds completely okay.\n\nBecause when I was learning the language I was taught the translations of all these words in my native language, and there is a very clear distinction there between which ones are only nouns and which ones are only adjectives. \n\nNow with people correcting me about my use of \"female writers\" I'm starting to doubt that it's the same case in English.\n\nMale and female are adjectives, to be used when you're referring to the sex because it's relevant. You can have a male writer. A female octopus. With lions \"the females will hunt while the males sleep\". These are all okay. Man and woman are nouns. For humans. You can't have a woman octopus. A man writer. If you say \"females do this, males do that\" it goes back to being an adjective emphasizing sex, and I totally get how that's dehumanizing. Women do this, men do that. This is how it's used. Or--NO?\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nPlease help.",
