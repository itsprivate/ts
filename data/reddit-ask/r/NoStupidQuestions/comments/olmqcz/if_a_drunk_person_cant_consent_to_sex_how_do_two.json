But if someone gets drunk, and they come on to another person and end up sleeping with them, it&#39;s generally considered that the sex was non-consensual. Please note that I&#39;m not arguing that point, I&#39;m just curious why people tend to view it differently, as someone who has never gotten drunk, never had sex, and both topics are rather taboo in my family.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
