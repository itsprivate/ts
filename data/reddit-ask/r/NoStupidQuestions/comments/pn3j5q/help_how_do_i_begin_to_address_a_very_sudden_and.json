Greeted the dog, as is tradition, she was very excited to see me. She sleeps on the bed all the time, she&#39;s getting older. </p>\n\n<p>As I approached the bed, I see something very unusual surround ing my bed at the sides and foot area. Didnt remember spilling rice all over the damn bedroom. Wtf?</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t rice. It was thousands of maggots. Like apocalyptic. Wtf??</p>\n\n<p>Immediately checked the dog ( who seemed concerned about my sudden concern).</p>\n\n<p>I ran to my nearly empty trashcan in the kitchen. Nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Checked every book and cranny around the bedroom, drains, fishtanks, under the bed while squatting over and amongst the hoarde of maggots surrounding it. Just let that sink in. It was fucking terrible. </p>\n\n<p>I ran like a fucking maniac from corner to corner, room to room, trying to figure out what in God&#39;s name would have spawned these maggots? My house is really clean, I recently spent a couple days  organizing and decluttering the week before. There is no food source nor smell of decay. </p>\n\n<p>And then it hit me. The opossum that had been breaking and entering, to eat dog food often in the mornings. I played cat and mouse, or human and marsupial, I guess, sealing off every entry point he managed to make over the past several months. Haven&#39;t seen him in a couple weeks now. </p>\n\n<p>He just is trapped, and rotting, somewhere inside of the walls, floor, ceiling? Where and how do I even start? </p>\n\n<p>Removed my dog and quarantined her with family, for obvious reasons. Sprayed the many hundreds of maggots in the bedroom with insecticide and dumped salt on them. Left. I&#39;m waiting for them to dessicate for a couple hours, and then hypothetically vaccum them up before burning the vacuum ceremoniously. </p>\n\n<p>This is a fucking nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had something like this happen? How did you fix it?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the most likely plan of action will be burning down my house and assuming a new identity. Please talk some sense into me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
