  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a 22 year old female who lives with her dog in a apartment. I work from home and probably leave the house 3 times a week. I’m single and have been for 2 years. I do the same thing over and over again. I would hangout with my friends but I have 2 and they’re both married and one has a kid. I also live paycheck to paycheck and over all my life is just pretty shitty at the moment. I’m overweight, but I have lost 35 pounds but I just don’t feel like it’s enough. I need to lose more. If it wasn’t for my dog and my family I wouldn’t be here. I also got diagnosed with border line personality disorder a month ago and I smoke weed on a daily because that’s the only thing that makes me feel some type of serotonin… so my question is; Does life get better? I’m just so lost in the world, I know nothing about me, I’m not sure of my purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
