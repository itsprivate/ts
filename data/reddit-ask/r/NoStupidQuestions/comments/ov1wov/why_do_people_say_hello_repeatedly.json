The work environment means that you&#39;re constantly moving around a big lab, and bumping into the same people over and over.</p>\n\n<p>I will always say hi, good morning at the beginning of the day - obviously, this makes sense to me. But when we&#39;re all moving around the lab, every time I bump into people they will greet me again. Why? We already said hello, I know you&#39;re here! </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not in a funny &#39;we meet again lol&#39; way either. It&#39;s an earnest hello. It gets so exhausting for me because I can&#39;t just move around the space finding what I need, I have to constantly reply back to people. It&#39;s like walking through an assault course tbh, being in an unfamiliar space trying to concentrate and if you don&#39;t reply back to random greetings, you&#39;re rude.</p>\n\n<p>Another behaviour I really don&#39;t understand that keeps happening is the following exchange:</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m approaching someone as we walk down a corridor from opposite ends.</p>\n\n<p>Person: hi!\nMe: good morning!\nPerson: how are you? \nMe: I&#39;m good thanks, how...</p>\n\n<p>And at this point where I&#39;m trying to be polite and ask them how they are in return, they carry on walking so I can no longer ask them. There will be other people around so I look rude in front of them. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly this work placement after a year of WFH has reminded me of why I dislike being around most people. There are so many things that can make you look rude and make people dislike you... I&#39;m just trying to come in, be polite, do my work and go home. The interactions I have with people are taking up more energy than the actual work itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
