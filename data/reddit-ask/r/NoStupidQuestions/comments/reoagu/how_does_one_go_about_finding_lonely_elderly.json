I remember how happy she&amp;#39;d be when I stopped by, she&amp;#39;d give me some candy, or make me some toast, she&amp;#39;d want to hear all about my life and activities. She was always eager to tell me stories aswell. I&amp;#39;d often bring my friends to her house too, which she really enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then when I&amp;#39;d leave, she&amp;#39;d always tell me how much of a delight it is for me to come over and give her company, and every time she would always tell me to be back soon. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about her, and nowbI realize how much it meant for her to have some company. At the time, I didn&amp;#39;t realize how lonely she was. It makes me sad to think that there&amp;#39;s lots of people like her, spending the last of their days alone, feeling as though they don&amp;#39;t exist to anyone, desperate to interact with people, but having no one ever come over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, both of my parents and grandparents are dead, I don&amp;#39;t know anyone with any wisdom to offer. Every young person would benefit from talking to old people. How do I find lonely old people?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
