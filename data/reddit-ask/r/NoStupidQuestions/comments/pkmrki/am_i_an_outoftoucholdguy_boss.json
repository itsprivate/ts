I have several teams that work for me, and each team has a team lead who reports directly to me. My best team (8 individuals ages 23-27) is managed by a lesbian who is engaged to another woman within our organization. </p>\n\n<p>Today my best team was hanging near my office having small talk. I heard “that’s fucking gay” from one of the females on the team. I have heard “that’s gay” several times from several members of this team; only in passing or when they are shooting the shit. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I pop out and ask the whole team to come into my office. I bring up how “gay” used in a derogatory manner could be offensive, and oh ya, have you guys forgotten your team lead is gay? The female who I heard say it tells me she identifies as LGBTQIA and she doesn’t care about it, but she also has never asked her boss how she felt about it. Ok. “How would you guys feel if I was in front of all the teams and said ‘that’s fucking gay’?” Everyone agreed it wouldn’t be cool. </p>\n\n<p>I didn’t tell them they couldn’t go around saying that, but I spoke to being professional and being cognizant of who is around. I think the general consensus was “that’s fucking gay” was no big deal to them.</p>\n\n<p>Am I out of touch? Was it wrong I used their team lead as an example?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
