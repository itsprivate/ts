Is it normal to not even have the desire to kiss someone you like until you know them for a long time (maybe even a year atleast) and trust them fully? I don’t feel any desire to do anything sexual with someone even if I like them unless I know them very very well and am certain they love me and wouldn’t leave. Is this normal? I’ve read the average time for a couple to make a relationship “physical” in terms of kissing can be 1-3 weeks and in terms of sex can be 1 month but I wouldn’t want to do it until atleast a year but does that mean no one would want to be with me long enough to wait or am I just pressuring myself for no reason? Thanks in advance for any advice.",
