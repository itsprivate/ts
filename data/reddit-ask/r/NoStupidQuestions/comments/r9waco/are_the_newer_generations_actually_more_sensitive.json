I dunno. Either way, are there any people from the 80s or 90s who can share their experiences and confirm or deny? Any good articles that talk about the subject? What are your guys opinions on the matter? I feel like there’s so many different factors that come into play that just saying “we’re too sensitive” is an overstatement?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
