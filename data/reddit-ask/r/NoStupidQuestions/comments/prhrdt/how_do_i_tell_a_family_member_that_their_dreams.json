I (17M) would love to support his goals but this just seems absolutely absurd to me. He has an extremely small following and is terrible at the games he streams. He does not help out around the house, he does not pay any kind of rent, and eats all of our food. I am very annoyed by this because my mom is single and I help her out as much as I can with absolutely everything, and half of my check from my part time job goes to rent, groceries, and bills because she cannot do it on her own. Should I just blatantly tell him to get off of his ass and do something with his life? Sorry, I just don’t know how to go about this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
