It&#39;s like 5&#39;3 and looks very realistic. </p>\n\n<p>I bought it when I was drunk like 2 years ago and didn&#39;t cancel the order the next day as I forgot I even ordered it; it showed up on my doorstep like 10 days later in a huge box... I tried to use it once but it is impossible to use because its so cold lol. I have it buried under clothes that I don&#39;t wear anymore in my walk-in closet for almost 2 years and every time I have a girl over I have to keep the closet locked and I even have to tell my cleaner to clean all rooms aside from my walk-in closet as I am embarrassed by it. </p>\n\n<p>I NEVER litter but I don&#39;t know what to do with it. I really want to put it in the back of my truck and dump it in the woods somewhere but I know that is a shit thing to do and will not do it. </p>\n\n<p>How can I dispose of it in a environmentally safe way without driving to a dump and looking like I am disposing of a dead body or having the workers laugh at me? I can&#39;t cut it up into pieces and put it into trash bags as the skeleton is metal and I just don&#39;t have the tools to do it; its a really legit sex doll it is super high quality. </p>\n\n<p>My apartment complex has a huge dumpster but its all on camera; should I just go there super late at night and throw it in there? The dumpster is on camera and its for &quot;trash only&quot; it says no metal and no boxes. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone have an answer on how to dispose of this thing by myself, quietly and without anyone seeing me? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks !!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
