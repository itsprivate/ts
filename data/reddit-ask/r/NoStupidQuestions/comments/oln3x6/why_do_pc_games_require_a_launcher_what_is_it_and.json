Anyway, all three games required a completely separate program to “launch” them. I don’t remember that being a thing. More recently I started playing WoW Classic and had to download Blizzard’s launcher first. Again, I don’t remember that being a thing.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly is a game launcher and what does it do? I get that steam is a marketplace for games that has largely replaced brick and mortar stores, but why can’t I just buy a game from them and run it without also downloading their launcher?
