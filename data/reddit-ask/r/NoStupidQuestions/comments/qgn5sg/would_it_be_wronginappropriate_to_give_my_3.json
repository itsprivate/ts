I was 20 when I got hired and they’ve put up with me a lot and have also mentored me a ton. We’re all super close as well. </p>\n\n<p>Over the last year I’ve been trading a fair bit on the stock market and have profited a comfortable amount. Recently, my coworkers have told me about financial troubles they are dealing with in their lives and would like to give back to them. One of my coworkers even lent me $1750 in the first month that I met her, so that I could pay the security deposit on my first apartment. They’ve really been there for me, especially when I was still trying to get situated in NYC last year when I ran out from my parents. </p>\n\n<p>So I was thinking since Christmas isn’t too far away that I would give them $5,000 each as thanks. The issue is I’m not sure if that’s an inappropriate thing to do. Also just the idea of a 21 year old giving a 45 year old that much money. Also is that too much money? And whatever other implications. I don’t know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
