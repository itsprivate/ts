Or basically a harmless joke since weed itself doesn&#39;t necessarily cause any harm? I have my own opinion, but just curious to see what others might think (and if you&#39;re curious what I think, I think it&#39;s a tiny bit fucked up, considering they may or may not have had their own moral beliefs towards the plant, but worse things can definitely be done)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
