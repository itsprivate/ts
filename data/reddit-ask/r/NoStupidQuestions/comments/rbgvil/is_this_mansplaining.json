Thanks everyone for their responses and feedback. About to depart so won&amp;#39;t be able to respond to anything for at least a few hours.  Moral of the story I suppose is that everyone is different, everyone can read what you say differently, and when in doubt do not comment on the price of beverages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
