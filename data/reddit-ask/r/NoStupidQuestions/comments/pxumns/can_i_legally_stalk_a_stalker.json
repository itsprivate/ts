My friend is afraid, he has destroyed her sense of safety. He sits in her section at work for hours, follows her into the parking lot,messages her on every app he can find, and has started randomly showing up at places she goes. If that is something he can legally do can I take up stalking him? I want to strip away his sense of safety. I want him peeking through curtains to see if I&#39;m outside. I want to follow his bitch ass around and take pictures. Whatever he LeGaLly does to her I want to do to him. So are the rules the same? Can I relentlessly stalk him until he fucks off and leaves her alone?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
