It’s disgusting and really unnerving. A lot of them are fetishizing me (many of them make comments directly to my face) since I am a young, small Asian female, and it’s come to the point where I’m wondering if getting a ring to wear when I’m out will help make them back off. \nI would always use the “I have a boyfriend” excuse and have even used coworkers to help pretend to be said “boyfriend,” but these men will not leave me alone. My manager has had to chase off multiple men, called security on those who were particularly…determined…to get me to say yes to them, and also asked my coworkers to escort me as I walk out to the parking lot after shifts. I feel dumb for wanting to pretend I’m engaged just for creeps to leave me alone—I also carry a stun gun and 2 pocket knives on me anytime I’m out—but I’m not sure what else I can do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
