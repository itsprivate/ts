This is a genuine question I am asking, and I want to know some of your personal experiences with this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you to everyone that responded to this. I asked this question because I have been trying to become more motivated to push through and bust my ass every day with good assignments, so I can leave ASAP while keeping my time occupied and not losing interest in persevering. I’m taking online math, geography and chemistry right now and I’ve been very working very hard on assignments. I want to put more time into it too (whole school day during lunch hour too and bus rides there and home) and working until 11:30 at night on assignments. So that I can get this done. I left 4 classes last year gr 11 so I’m with people a year younger than me in Chem trying to earn these credits. I’ll read more of these tomorrow. I gotta go to sleep for school.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
