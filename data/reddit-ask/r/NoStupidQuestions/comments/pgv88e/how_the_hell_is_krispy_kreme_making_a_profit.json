But NOW they&#39;re giving away TWO FREE DONUTS to the vaccinated. How are they doing all of this without crashing their business? I ate there once when I was eleven, and now I go there every day to get the free donuts and nothing else, and I can&#39;t be the only one like that. At first I thought this was started as a drug-dealer-esque &quot;first hit&#39;s free&quot; but I&#39;ve gotten more than enough hits to let me know that Krispy Kreme donuts taste good. How are they not bankrupt?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if the language I used made this sound like a rant. I&#39;m not angry, I&#39;m genuinely confused.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
