Pretty much perfect hundreds of 5-star reviews at both locations for over a decade now. </p>\n\n<p>Out of the blue, a few days ago, a tiktokker came in. She falsely made claims that my parents&#39; restaurant is racist <em>to its own native people</em> and that they only serve whites. She is literally trying to cancel the only restaurant in the city that represents her very own people.</p>\n\n<p>So, my parents&#39; place is being bombarded with 1-star reviews because of this one-sided story. It&#39;s tearing my mom&#39;s heart apart because this restaurant is all she ever wanted. Is there anything I can do to stop this? Any advice I can relay to them?</p>\n\n<p>They are so so so not racist, my parents are the kindest people I know and have literally built a school in their homeland and they can&#39;t wait to retire and move back. Yet, someone thinks they&#39;re racist against their own people.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for the responses. Never been in a situation like this, I usually am able to research my way through things but I couldn&#39;t find a way to navigate this without a subreddit like this. I&#39;ve been spending time contacting support on Google/ Yelp. I won&#39;t be doing anything to her socials.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thankful for the requests for me to share the restaurant so you can visit/review, but unfortunately revealing the name would make me identifiable (military so not ideal).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
