One night it was just rapid fire and got really annoying. </p>\n\n<p>For example my girl was going upstairs to get something and said &quot;Stay here &#39;John&#39;&quot; to indicate she would be back quick. Her dad, from the other room, said &quot;Sit John. Lay down. Bark. Good boy&quot;. Later I was getting up and my girlfriend said &quot;put my phone on the couch for me?&quot; and her dad replied &quot;Who&#39;s the man in this relationship?&quot;.. Even though I was doing my girlfriend a simple favor like anyone would. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s more stuff, like asking &quot;what are you made of?&quot; if I say I don&#39;t like wasabi, pinching my arm between two fingers when my girl says I&#39;m getting stronger at the gym, etc. I usually just ignore but I&#39;d rather he just act with me like he would with anyone else. That kind of thing is annoying to me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
