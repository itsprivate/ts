He explained that the 3 angles of a triangle always add up to 180 and 180 is half of 360. I said “yes but why 360 degrees?” And the teacher said “because 360 degrees makes a circle!” And the whole class laughed at me. I think they either all misunderstood the question or I am the stupidest person on planet earth and haven’t figured out this obvious issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
