Thought this was a weird movie thing but was cleaning up with my partner (white Australian), and he picked up my soapy unrinsed bowl to dry it!! I was grossed out that he'd just do that but he told me it's normal???? Do you put your soapy dishes on the rack ? What if they have food grease on them ???? Is this normal ????????",
