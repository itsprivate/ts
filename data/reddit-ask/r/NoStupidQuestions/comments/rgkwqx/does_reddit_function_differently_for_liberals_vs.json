I have quite literally never seen a post in &lt;a href=\"/r/politics\"&gt;r/politics&lt;/a&gt; that paints conservatives as anything but evil. I don’t agree with a lot of their policies and beliefs, but I REALLY don’t like only consuming one side/opinion of every story. Conservatives are not wrong on every single issue and liberals are not right on every single issue. In fact there are plenty of liberals that are just as much of corrupt POS’s as the worst conservatives. I really don’t like that I’m seeing nothing but good news about them. Just makes it feel like I’m being fed propaganda… So my question is: do conservative redditors see a different newsfeed than a liberal redditor would?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
