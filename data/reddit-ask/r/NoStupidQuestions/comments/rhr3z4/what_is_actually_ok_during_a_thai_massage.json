  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since september, instead of going to a therapist like recommended I decided to spend my money on thai massages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am NOT searching for happy endings; I just want the kind of painful massages since I’m struggling with my shoulders because of climbing and I think that could be the cause of being constantly stressed out. Well, one of the causes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But during my last visit, some things happened. First of all, I want to be open minded and prepared for a difference in culture. Me, being a white man grown up in Belgium, we are very closed off. Our personal bubbles are tiny. I want to expand mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway here we go: when my hand was hanging a bit from the table, she pushed her crotch against it, pretty obviously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she was standing behind me massaging my torso her breasts were pushed against my face a lot. I’m ok with that but I can figure that some people will either make a problem of it, or expect more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started talking near the end and because I was ticklish at my feet she started to tease me by testing out other parts of my body. Again, no problem, no boundaries were crossed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my leg massages her hand/arm repeatingly touched my balls/penis, this is something that I think just happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So; is this all sketchy? I wonder because I don’t want to give the impression I’m coming for more than a massage. I also don’t wanna be lured into stuff. Well I won’t, but it could make things awkward and I kinda like this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a Belgian I’m afraid to ask them openly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
