I am Black and elements of my culture are apparent in all things that I do. I play gospel music on Sundays when its time to clean, make \"soul food\" for Christmas dinner and even do a lot of volunteering for Black organizations. I don't really want to stop those things but I'm worried a fusion might put these kids in an awkward spot growing up and they could be bullied. \n\n I love these kids and my best friend too. My friend was in a transracial adoption and part of her reason for being estranged from her adoptive parents was because of the isolation and bullying she dealt with being forced to ignore all aspects of where she came from. And so when she had children with her Korean husband, she was super excited to teach them about her community. Its important to me that I try to maintain that with the kids as well even as they are raised by two Black parents. This isnt the same as growing up with parents who don't have a culture like my friend. They are distinctly going to be raised by two people who have a culture and that culture is far from their own. I just want them to be happy. I want them to know that I love them and I want the kids to love their backgrounds too.\n\nMy struggle is because I'm not sure where to start. There aren't many resources for non-white people who are in transracial adoptions.\n\nedit: Clarity",
