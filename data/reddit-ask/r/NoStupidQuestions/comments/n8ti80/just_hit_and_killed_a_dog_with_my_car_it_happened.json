I don't even remember seeing the little chihuahua type dog run out in front of my car, it ran out from behind a parked car and it had no leash on and I think it basically ran right in front of my bumper because I really don't remember seeing it at all just hearing it. I stop my car and get out and I see a little dog dying behind my car and the teenager girl is crying. Her dad (I think) was there and said I was driving too fast, I don't think I was.\n\nI stuck around for 5 long minutes while the girl was crying and calling people. The dad walked up to the dog and it kinda twitched a few times but seemed to be dying. There was blood and poop and it seemed like the dog got rolled beneath my front right and rear right tire. I took a couple pictures. A lot of cars drove by while I was standing by so to me it's pretty obvious the little dog should not have been in the drive way without a leash on with all the traffic. The dad again said I was driving too fast, I said I was driving slow.\n\nWhat should I have done? I didn't even apologize profusely or anything, didn't want to assume liability, may have just said sorry once while I stood there. How are these things supposed to be handled? After 5 mins I just got in my car and drove away.\n\n100% sober BTW. I was just on my way to buy some groceries. Happened in NV.",
