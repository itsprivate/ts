I have nephews, but no kids of my own. So I don&#39;t know all the secrets of being a parent. What I do know is that some kids are monsters. I could definitely see some bratty 6-yr old kid throwing a tantrum in public (store, park, whatever) and then exclaiming &quot;you&#39;re not my dad/mom! I don&#39;t know you! Leave me alone!&quot; or something like that, because they know that words like that can get you in shit. They just don&#39;t realize how big of shit.</p>\n\n<p>So now some concerned employee/customer/stranger has gotten themselves involved. WTF do you do!? Do you get a certificate of ownership when you have a kid or something? A secret branding mark on their butt? How do you prove to a stranger that this child is your offspring or you are responsible for them? How do you prove the same to an officer if things escalate?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
