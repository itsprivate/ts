While learning the language I&amp;#39;ve learnt how to write it and even the way I phrase things is not the most &amp;quot;English&amp;quot; way I almost never make spelling mistakes... Or at least I&amp;#39;m aware of them. We learn that pronunciation is very different from writing in English, so we learn how to write.\nAt the same time I can write in my native language without struggling, and same goes for almost everyone: the ones who can&amp;#39;t write correctly are mostly not educated people, or very old ones. But what I&amp;#39;m noticing is that young educated English speaking people have an hard time with spelling as well.\nWhy is that? Is it a school thing? Like, you don&amp;#39;t focus on the writing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some examples of mistakes I keep on seeing: your/you&amp;#39;re, should of instead of should have, their/they&amp;#39;re, ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.s. I don&amp;#39;t mean to be offensive in any way, so sorry if I come across as judgemental. I&amp;#39;m genuinely baffled and I would like to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
