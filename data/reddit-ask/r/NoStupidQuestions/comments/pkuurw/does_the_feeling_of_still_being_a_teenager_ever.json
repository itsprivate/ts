I don&#39;t feel mature for my age and I&#39;m shocked at seeing people in my age group who actually look and act like adults. Sometimes I even forget that I&#39;m above the age of consent and feel weird when guys around or older than me hit on me before I remember. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like I need to buy a house decorated in all white with live-laugh-love and have little gatherings with wine and cheese to be an adult. And I hate that, because I like video games and lava lamps and glow in the dark stuff, but that&#39;s not what an adult is about.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: just to add on, I turned 19 and 20 during the pandemic so that could be a contribution factor for a lot of us who became adults. Thank you everyone for sharing how you feel and your experiences with age!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
