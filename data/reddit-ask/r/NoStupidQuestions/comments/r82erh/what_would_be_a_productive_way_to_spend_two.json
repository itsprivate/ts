During this time I would like to be able to be productive instead of wasting that time just watching TV, reading, etc. I should also note that I should (hopefully) be lucid and not hopped up on too many drugs, so my mental capacities should still all be there. However for the life of me I can’t figure out what would be the best use of the time. I don’t have a job that would allow me to accomplish anything from working remotely. So I’m turning to Reddit to see what y’all think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
