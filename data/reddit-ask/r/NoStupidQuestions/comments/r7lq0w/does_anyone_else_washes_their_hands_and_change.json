I have never come home and lay down on my bed with the clothes I wore at school or going out. I just think it’s gross that people would be comfortable walking in their house with shoes on, not washing their hands first, and just not changing their clothes prior to sitting or laying down. I’ve seen it with my non-Asian friends all the time when I would come over to their house. I thought I was weird, until my ex-Girlfriend(non-Asian btw) lived with me and she pretty much did the same hygienic practice as I did. I don’t understand, can someone explain?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
