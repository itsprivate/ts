They taught us how and when but they never really enforced it - like I've seen / heard most parents do - and so I never got into the frequent or steady habit. I don't know about my siblings.\n\nBut because of this, plus my family's really trash diet, I've always gotten a lot of cavities.. tooth aches. Jaw aches. Bleeding gums. You name it. So as I'm growing older, I want to get into a more routine habit of brushing teeth. \n\nOther than frequency, I'm worried about honestly getting into that frequency. I go to bed late from work and schooling, but I'm usually so wiped that I don't want to.\n\nHow do I get into this habit?\nHow have you guys maintained this habit or at least do it relatively frequently?\nAny tips for brushing teeth you wanna share or weird methods ya got?",
