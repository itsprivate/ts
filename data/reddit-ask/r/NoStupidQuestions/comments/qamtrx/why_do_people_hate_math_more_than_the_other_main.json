I follow a YouTube channel who put up a community poll asking what the worst subject was and the results were unanimously (like 75%) for Math! That bothers me because growing up, I actually used to think Math (and Science) to an extent, was easier than English and History because the &quot;answers were concrete&quot; and I didn&#39;t have to put things into my own words. IDK, maybe it was because I was socially awkward. I never really understood essays either, I wrote a bunch of filler. I was a weird kid. But what are other people seeing that I&#39;m not seeing? Is it that I&#39;m &quot;left-brained&quot; or something? I&#39;m also left-handed, maybe that&#39;s part of it. I just wanna know what&#39;s wrong with me for this and many other unpopular opinions.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention an extremely key point. I said that as a kid in Elementary and Middle School, by High School I stopped saying it. I don&#39;t know why, but I know that the people who say Math is hard are probably not taking about arithmetic and geometry, are they?</p>\n\n<p>Why am I holding onto something I said as a child anyway? As if it reflects my current views?ðŸ™„</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
