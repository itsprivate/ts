I’ll be asked to click all the buses, and find that I’m also expected to click on coaches, too. A coach is different to a bus, but I guess not in America. I’ll be asked to click all the traffic lights, of course I know what a traffic light is. Or do I? Because apparently in America “traffic light” means “yellow box.”\n\nIt just seems bizarre. Of all the thousands of things that exist which have the *same* name and *look the same* in every country, why on earth do CAPCTHA tests seem to *exclusively* ask you to identify things that only apply to the United States?\n\nIs it to stop Chinese/Russian attacks on websites?
