I excelled in school, got honors, went on to do very well in college and graduated with my BA in English. I was consistently told in high school to get a degree, any degree, to land a job, and I thought I wanted to be a teacher. Quickly came the realization that the pay and work sucks, so I ended up not going into that. I struggled to find any kind of job that paid well for several years, finally found something I did love doing but could not advance in that field without a masters, so I went back for that. Well, now I have two degrees under my belt and I’m not really making much more money at all. I work my main job and two-three other gigs just to keep afloat. I do really love my main job but it doesn’t pay enough. I’m constantly worn out and just want to be able to live a quiet little life working one job. Covid wiped any sort of savings me and my partner had, and it’s impossible to get ahead. We do not live extravagantly, and it’s hard to find more places to cut back.</p>\n\n<p>I see my friends, and my peers, saving and getting married and having kids and buying houses and it just depresses me. My partner and I are engaged, but we can’t afford any kind of nice wedding. I don’t want kids, but it’s tough to see people being in the position to have them. Buying a house is out of the question since little one room shacks go for half a million in my area and most people buying them come in with hundreds of thousands of dollars over asking price and buy in cash. </p>\n\n<p>I’m 32 in January and I don’t know how to go on with this grind. I guess I could back to school? Im trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel here but I’m just not seeing it. I’m stuck working 50-60 hours a week just to break even, forget about all the hallmarks of being an adult. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone relate? How do you deal?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
