I recently learned that apparently non-binary people are not necessarily 'in-between' or 'intermediate' but [may have multiple genders, either simultaneously, or in series](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary) .\n\nI understand the concepts of male, female, transgender, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, androgynous. If those are categories that people feel they are, that's up to them. We shouldn't be treating people differently on the basis of sex or sexuality anyway. What I don't get is the declaration of 'non-binary *AND*...', e.g. 'non-binary *AND* male'; 'non-binary *AND* female' ; 'non-binary *AND* female *AND* male' etc. So you're saying that you are both 'x' *AND* 'not-x'? Or that it may change by the day? If I compare that to sexuality then an individual would simply be considered bisexual, perhaps serially monogamous, polyamourous, or promiscuous, but still simply 'bisexual'. There are [many gender identities one may find listed](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Category:Gender_Identities). We might suppose that not all of these labels are sincere, but regardless I can't imagine that many people will have heard of many of these, still less be able to negotiate them. There's 219 categories on that page, so 47961 possible combinations of any 2 individuals. It does seem from the outside a little like children saying 'I'm an angel! I'm an eagle!'.\n\nCan someone offer an explanation that makes sense in the context of fully adult life, not simply academia or student-hood where we all like to set the world to rights, but where we work 40 hour weeks, have a family etc, aren't trying to judge or be unkind but simply don't have several years to do a pHD in gender studies?",
