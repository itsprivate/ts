I would have posted to the r/cybersecurity but I had too low of karma to post there.\n\nSo I am in a undergraduate Cybersecurity program. This is my second week of college and I already have 5 assignments. I need to choose a fairly recent security breach and write an assignment from **Laws and Security policies** point of view.  Honestly I would take my time to google and research the topics to choose myself, but this one is due in 5days and already have 4 other assignment. I have already wasted 2 days looking for topics and got overwhelmed.\n\nThere are so many topics to choose from and so little time. So please can cybersecurity/netsec guys  reading this help me choose a topic that already has lot of analysis done.\n\nThank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:- This is the most helpful community I have seen so far. I got so many helpful responses in such short time. I have shortlisted to  Anthem, Equifax, JP Morgan Chase, Adobe. I will choose one of these and hopefully complete it before due date.\n\n**You guys are awesome.**",
