My husband got attacked by a raccoon and refuses to get rabies shots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I get rabies from him if he were to be infected?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks everyone. Husband doesn&amp;#39;t believe rabies is REAL, I obviously do, and am deciding how to deal with such a ridiculous scenario for my protection and our kids. I am not worried about my husband biting me, but worried about him spreading it through kissing or living in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: my sweet boy made it out of surgery, recovering, and begins the doggie rabies exposure protocol today. He may not walk the same anymore due to the muscles and nerves being damaged but he should heal okay. Unfortunately, I also found out that rabies is endemic in my area so now I will be anxiously waiting for him to get the all clear from the vet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last update for awhile: husband still refuses to vaccinate. The kids and I will be seeking vaccines and staying away from him and I guess he&amp;#39;ll either die or live. He doesn&amp;#39;t care what anyone else says as he is still refusing to believe it exists, even if it hurts us. This will be my last update for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
