Personally, I think that&#39;s crap. Have you seen what math majors do in their upper level math classes? Have you seen the stuff that science majors do? Chem majors take just as much math as engineers, physics majors take more. Bio majors may not take the math, but they apply a lot of the chem to pretty complicated systems. </p>\n\n<p>Even non stem majors can be very labor intensive. A friend of mine was a global affairs major and he was always writing 30 page papers several times per semester. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t get it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
