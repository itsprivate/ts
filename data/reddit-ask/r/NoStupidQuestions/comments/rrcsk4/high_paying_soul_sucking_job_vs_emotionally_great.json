After months and months of trying I finally have heard back from some job offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Job A pays a lot more than I’ve ever made over 100k. No health insurance, contractor work, lots of OT.  It would suck but I have a lot of debt and it’d help get rid of a big chunk fast. It’s also help me save for a house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Job B is one I emotionally really care about. The pay is 55k, but with insurance and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve weighed the pros and cons, but for some reason I am still going in a circle. The idea of getting rid of my debt and being able to save for a house for the first time in my life seems amazing. However I know it’ll be soul sucking and I won’t have much free time. On the other hand I know I would like job B but I’m so anxious with over 70k of debt from school and no savings to start a house fund it’s a burden. However I’m sure I’d be happier and feel like I’m contributing to society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these can be temporary or longer. However both rarely have openings and have made it clear if I say no now there will not be another chance with either for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any input or advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
