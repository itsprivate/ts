But do you think that is actually true? I am a woman, and when I&#39;m sat at home on my own on a friday/Saturday night, I don&#39;t do my make up and hair, and wear a skimpy dress. If, hypothetically, I went for a drink with a girlfriend and knew we wouldn&#39;t see a single other person the whole night (like empty pubs and streets), I wouldn&#39;t dress up. But if I go on a date, or for drinks with friends, I dress up and do my make up, because I want to look nice, and it&#39;s nice to feel a bit attractive. Could you honestly say you only wear make up and dress up for yourself?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
