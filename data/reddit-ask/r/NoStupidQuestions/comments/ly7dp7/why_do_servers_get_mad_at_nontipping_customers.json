And I want to say that I am genuinely curious about this AND I always tip at least 20%. However, I don't really understand why some servers get very upset at non-tipping customers rather than at their employers. I understand that it is a hard job, and that some workers don't get paid very much so the tips help make up for that, but I feel like the responsibility should not be on the customer to pay additional money for the server's wage. My friend worked as a server and would get paid $2.70 an hour and rely on tips for her wage. I see countless rants from servers on Social Media about non-tipping customers and I am just confused. Why isn't that energy redirected at the employer paying them $2.70 an hour? Why haven't more people and servers tried to pass laws to ensure that servers are paid a better wage, and do not have to rely on tips? I have wondered this for years.",
