I don&#39;t do anything in my free time and am solely focused on finishing school (hopefully by the end of this August) and getting my career off the ground. I&#39;ve had long-term stable employment for the last 10 years, no criminal history / clean background. Currently in Greater Orlando area but thinking about moving to GA (Metro-Atlanta) as I have more resources are there. I don&#39;t know what to do in this situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m 30 years old and transitioning careers. Currently a senior finishing a degree in computer science (attending remote / virtually) and hope to be done by August of this year.</p>\n\n<p>I lost a part time job at the beginning of the year and found myself living with my aging parents who assured me I can finish school while I stay with them. Unfortunately, they elected to move to Florida on a whim. They told me I needed to help them move or to get out... having little to no notice and few resources available I caved, I needed a roof over my head so I can get this degree done.</p>\n\n<p>My parents didn&#39;t plan for this life change accordingly (they&#39;ve always struggled financially) and it has become apparent that they&#39;ve screwed up. I&#39;ve drained my checking and savings account and am nearly maxed on a credit card by living with them and having to support them. My mother is full on in hysterics about how she needs to get a job again (both of my parents are retired living on social security / retirement). The only way she interacts with me is screaming about how I need to stop being lazy or get the fuck out (despite 10 - 12 hour days working solely on school). There is an expectation that I start working and provide for both of them.</p>\n\n<p>This situation has greatly hurt my relationship with my parents. I don&#39;t want to be around them or associate with them. I know and appreciate they&#39;re getting older and probably having a tough time with that, but at this moment I cannot even support myself.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m suffering severe financial, physical, and emotional distress by being here. I currently reside in the greater Orlando area. I previously left Metro-Atlanta (Georgia) and I am considering moving back as I may have more resources and sleeping in my car worst case scenario.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what to do or where to turn. I&#39;m willing to sleep on the street as long as I can move in the right direction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
