We have more people in the world, so we have more traffic. Why have all of these people go in at the exact same time and leave at the exact same time? Imagine if most companies ran on a 24hr schedule. You wouldn&#39;t have to worry about making in time before closing to deal with whatever emergency you have at the moment. I understand that a lot of humans operate during the day and thats just the way it is, but all of us dont. So whats the downside to a 24hr society?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
