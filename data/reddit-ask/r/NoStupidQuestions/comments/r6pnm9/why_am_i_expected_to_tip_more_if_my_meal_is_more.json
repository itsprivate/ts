This gets me a few side eyes, and I get to thinking &amp;quot;shit, is that not enough?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sparks a conversation. My understanding is the waiter keeps all those tips. I&amp;#39;m told tips work on &lt;em&gt;percentages&lt;/em&gt; of the total amount of your meal. My question is why? They&amp;#39;re walking that plate out the same way, no matter what&amp;#39;s on it. Are they cooking that food? Are they doing the dishes in the back? Why tip the waiter more?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m buying more stuff, shouldn&amp;#39;t the back of house get the extra percentage of the tip, if anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
