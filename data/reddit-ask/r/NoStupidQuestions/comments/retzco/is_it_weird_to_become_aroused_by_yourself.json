It usually comes in waves, though. I get pretty turned on from seeing myself naked, then I’ll bust out a load to myself, then not be turned on by myself for about another 6 months then I start getting aroused from seeing myself naked and just stand by a mirror looking over my body. I’m pretty much fully straight too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
