If i were to go to the mall and give out handmade stuffed animals to random people (probably children since they’d appreciate it most), would this be seen as suspicious or just nice? I like to make people happy and my creations are taking up a lot of space so it would work out really well as long as it’s not seen as weird or suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
