Now there’s been a car parked at the very end of my driveway with the front facing my house for the past 3 hours. Throughout those 3 hours the headlights have come on for around 3-5 minutes and then turned off at random times. Most recently, I noticed the headlights turn on but as soon as they saw me they turned back off. Should I be worried or am I just overthinking and assuming things?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: The car left a few minutes after this post was made. Best case, it was a completely innocent neighborhood watch. Worst case, I’ve got a serial killer/stalker after me lmao.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
