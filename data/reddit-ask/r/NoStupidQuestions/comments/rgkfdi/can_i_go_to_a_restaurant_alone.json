I just don’t know if the servers will think I’m weird, or if they would straight up just not serve me because I would be wasting a table or something? Or maybe I would just be perceived as a weirdo from everyone else in the restaurant? No idea at all, but i’d like to go if it’s possible and not a total social no-no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I did it! I enjoyed myself and it wasn’t as bad as I had expected even though I was super nervous. Thank you guys for all of your comments, it really helped encourage me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
