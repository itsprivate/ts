Do they just don&amp;#39;t care? Do they have zero to none relationships with friends and family? I&amp;#39;m curious on how a person could decide &amp;quot;Ok, I&amp;#39;m going to show my whole nude body to the world, and I&amp;#39;m also going to show my face&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: The reason I&amp;#39;m asking this is that my gf and I are thinking about going in the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot;. But we are very scared that people would recognize us if we show our faces on camera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: We also think that showing your face is an important aspect of online cam-shows, like people who also show their faces get more views. So that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re in such a dilemma about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
