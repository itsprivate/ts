I began doing this as soon as I turned 18 and decided I wanted to turn my life around. </p>\n\n<p>And eventually...across Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Discord, etc, literally NOBODY was left...</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t try to reach out to those people several times either. They just left me on read every time, or left a one word response that left no room for actual conversation. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, it kind of sucks to know that all my &quot;friends&quot; till today were never that close to me, and that I wasn&#39;t close to them...but since graduating high school I haven&#39;t seen any of those people ONCE anyway. Not even through text, since they all just left me on read.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
