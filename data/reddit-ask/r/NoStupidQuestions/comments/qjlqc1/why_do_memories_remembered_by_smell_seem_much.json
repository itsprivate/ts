I used it for about a month or two, and then kinda stopped using it.</p>\n\n<p>However, at that time, I had just graduated from college and I decided to watch anime for the first time. I bought the lotion right as I was finishing Attack on Titan and starting to watch Naruto.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, every time I use that lotion again (once in a full moon), right as I smell the coconut, I get a massive rush of memories about that time (only a year ago). I can vividly remember how I felt, where I spent most of my time in my old room in our previous apartment, and I specifically have this weird feeling of remembering watching anime for the first time and how I felt so hooked on these shows at the time.</p>\n\n<p>These memories seem to be soo much more intense than usual memories where you just remember something randomly about an old time in your life.</p>\n\n<p>Even sounds can also be included in this phenomenon, as listening to an old song you used to listen back in the day can really bring you back to that era and make you remember even how you <em>felt</em> at the time, along with a bunch of other things associated with the memory.</p>\n\n<p>We humans seem to be very visual by nature, but in this case I think the sense of smell seems to bring the most intense memories out of all the senses. Then, hearing specific sounds, and only then, seeing specific things.</p>\n\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any replies (:</p>\n\n<p>Edit: typo. As someone pointed out, my grandma is not Gaara of the Sand. She makes desserts, not <em>deserts</em> lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
