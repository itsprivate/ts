Ive tried schedules, I barely smoke pot anymore (bc that made it worse). I let myself naturally wake up, I use alarms, etc etc. \nsleeping with my gf or in a different bed doesn’t seem to have an impact either. \nIts a roll of the dice of how Ill feel when I wake up, and it carries over through the day. I sleep solid through the night never waking up. \nI went to a dr. and had bloodwork - im fine, and it cost $400, so before you say go to a sleep specialist.... </p>\n\n<p>Maybe its phone/screen usage? My job is mainly on a computer and I game a bit, but I never have an issue falling asleep. I can literally fall asleep on command if I wanted to bc im usually just that tired.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
