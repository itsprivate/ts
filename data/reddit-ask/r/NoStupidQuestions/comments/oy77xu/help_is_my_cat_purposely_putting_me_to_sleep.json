Like, when I lie in bed with her, I&#39;m not even tired. And I don&#39;t even feel myself dozing off. There&#39;s no warning. The minute I get into bed, and she starts purring, I open my eyes and it&#39;s the middle of the night.</p>\n\n<p>Like yeah, okay.. Maybe I&#39;m just lazy. Maybe I drink too much caffeine.</p>\n\n<p>Or <em>maybe.</em> Just <em>maybe. SHE&#39;S DOING IT ON PURPOSE.</em> Like some sort of evil sleep witch. <em>MAYBE</em> she knows exactly what she&#39;s doing. So I lie down, wanting to take just a five minute break.. And five minutes turns into five bloody hours.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
