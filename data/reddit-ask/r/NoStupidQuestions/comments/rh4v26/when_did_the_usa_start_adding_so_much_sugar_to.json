An example is I used to buy &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; applesauce which has lots of sugar added to get kids to eat it. I switched to unsweetened applesauce and it tasted so bland at first! But after a few months of eating unsweetened I accidentally bought the regular version again and I couldn&amp;#39;t eat it at all. It tasted like liquid sugar and was disgusting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was this change to get people addicted to certain foods? To please kids? I&amp;#39;m curious!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
