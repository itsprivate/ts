I am not one for forcing people to do anything, even if you &#39;think&#39; you are helping them. My friends fiancé expressed that she wouldn&#39;t help anyone, doesn&#39;t feel sorry for people like that and it&#39;s his money he earned. I was trying to explain I get all of that but also trying to explain to her that he wouldn&#39;t be able to spend all of his money in his lifetime if he tried. So what harm would it do trying to make the world a better place? She kept ranting about why she doesn&#39;t feel sorry for the less fortunate kind and I just gave up. I was just curious on how others felt about things like this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
