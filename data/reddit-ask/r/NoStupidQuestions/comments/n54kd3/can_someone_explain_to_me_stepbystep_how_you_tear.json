NEVER been done.\n\nI've seen other people do it as if god gifted them with the hands of Bruce Lee's 3rd cousin, moving gracefully like water and 1, 2, 3 - perfect piece of cling wrap, unwrinkled, and ready to be wrapped around their dick. I've seen it float through the air, miraculously not sticking to something or ruining it, and lay it on their sandwich like their tucking that shit to bed with a cling wrap blanket.\n\nI mean COME ON PEOPLE. It's like the maker of Saran was laughing his ass off making those stupid boxes with aluminum teeth, knowing full well that piece of shit cling wrap is gonna stick together and make a plastic wrap fucking burrito sandwich. At this point I feel like big Saran is purposefully not inventing a more intuitive way of getting this cling wrap off the roll just so you fuck it up. Then you have to try at least 4-5 times before it looks like a geriatric's scrotum sack after they've taken an ice bath but is by some measure is still usable. Next thing you know you're out of cling wrap and it's back to the store to buy another fucking roll. I wouldn't be surprised if some easy-to-rip cling wrap box inventor was suffocated by one of their hitmen, and I'll bet you they didn't do it with cling wrap. And let's not even mention how the price went up by a buck. What a fucking joke.\n\nThis is not a rant or troll post. I legitimately want to know how to tear it off the roll without it furling. How do you do it, step-by-step. I can't be the only one here.",
