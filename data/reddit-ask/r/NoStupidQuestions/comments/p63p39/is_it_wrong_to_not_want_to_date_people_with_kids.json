I was talking to someone and found out through IG that they have kids. They went off on me and said I was selfish and wrong. I have dated with men with kids, even ones who promise there is no drama, there always is. I think it&#39;s a huge responsibility to date someone with kids and if it ends up serious, it&#39;s a responsibility I don&#39;t want!</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: I am a woman. I think people just assume a woman wants kids and I&#39;m selfish for not. So some men with kids think it&#39;s selfish of me or there is something wrong with me because I&#39;m supposed to want and be around kids.</p>\n\n<p>Edit3: I asked because it has happened multiple times! I&#39;m like am I the asshole? üôÑüßê</p>\n\n<p>Edit4: I&#39;m 33. I&#39;m pretty firm on this stance of no kids.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
