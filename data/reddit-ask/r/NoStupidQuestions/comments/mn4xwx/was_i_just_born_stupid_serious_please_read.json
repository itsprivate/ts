While I am an all A student, most the time I can only pass tests/quizzes that consist of slightly modified problems from a practice worksheet/notes. I have a really hard time \"inferring\" what a best solution would be. For example, I have a really hard time with problems asking \"based on the text how does x feel about y\"? In other words, I cannot just think up of the best solution, or ever see a best solution out of a set of certain answers. \n\nA lot of my friends do so much better than me in school, jobs, relationships, etc and most the time they seem like they do is seamlessly. I work and study every night for school/SAT and some of my buddies do jack and still get all A's and 1400-1500+ scores first try. The only reason I have good grades is because I work almost endlessly and just barely grasp concepts (plus online school has come in clutch). \n\nMy parents have told me that they noticed I was a fairly low scorer even in my youth. While I was never behind on it, I never read or showed intrest in educational things such as that. They have and still wonder if I am on the spectrum, though. It does not help that my brother (he is on the spectrum) is extremely talented and does almost everything better than me. Both him and I are piano players, but he was playing year 6 stuff on his 3rd year while I am pretty bad compared to the time ive played for (and I practice consistently). He is much better at grasping acedemics, and if he actually had a work ethic in school I wouldn't doubt he could've gone to Harvard. In conclusion, I am very slow at picking things up. \n\nI also struggle at almost anything strategy related. Whenever I play games such as Risk, Catan, etc. that involves planning and problem solving I almost always lose/fall behind. I am so incredibly bad at these things it makes me look, well, STUPID.  \n\nI could go on a rant of a lot of other things I just can't grasp but these are just main problems I have. Are these just signs that I was born unintelligent? I mean I don't think its wrong that some people are smarter than me. While I am jealous of some peoples intelligence, I don't think it should be stripped away from them just because its unfair. This sounds like a whine post, but I am just genuinely wondering what others think.",
