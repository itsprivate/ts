I don't know if and when I'll be able to see her again.\n\nThe relatives who live close to her say that she has good days and bad days, talking on the phone is difficult, sometimes she is her usual (or old) self, clear and focused, but other times she says things which are just absurd or wrong. She recently sent me an email where she says her life feels different each day and that she feels her mental capabilities are much worse, but what's left is still interesting and full of richness.\n\nIs there any \"right\" way to communicate in writing to a person with Alzheimers? Should I consider visiting her in person when possible? Of course I'd love to see her and do that, but I'm scared she wouldn't recognize me, or that she'd be embarassed by her mental state. In short, I don't want to do anything that might harm or further confuse her.",
