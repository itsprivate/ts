I beat myself up for it. My dad passed away, and I know he’s either looking down and understanding, or really upset with me, or not looking down on me at all because that’s not even logical. But the thought hits me hard just the same. </p>\n\n<p>Like the other day she swore that my cousin didn’t have any kids. I’d say, the cousins in that particular family were closer to their grandparents than I was. Not that I wasn’t close, but their mom was the only girl and she’s very close with her mom. Anyways. How am I supposed to maneuver a conversation when I’m telling a story about my cousins kids, and my grandma is telling me they <em>do not</em> have kids and she’s never met them. She acts hurt that these are her grandkids and she’s “never met them”. So I obviously want to let her know that she has met them, a bunch of times! But how crazy would that make you feel, if you were her - and someone was telling you people existed and you had relationships with them, and you don’t remember them even existing? </p>\n\n<p>I never know what to do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
