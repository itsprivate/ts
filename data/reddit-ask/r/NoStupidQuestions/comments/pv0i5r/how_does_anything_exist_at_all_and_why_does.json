Like there should be nothing but what would nothing look like or be? It wouldn&#39;t just be blackness because that&#39;s something. So moving past how anything at all exists, from a 3rd person perspective, I can sort of see how life can be created and exist but it&#39;s a total mindfuck that I am me. Like I myself am a thing come from nothing. I can&#39;t stop thinking about this shit every day and the only logical thing is there is a God and we are in an existence of rules we can only comprehend and life outside of this universe has a whole different set of physics, rules, etc. That explains existence. Something that we can&#39;t even think of. Which doesn&#39;t really make sense but is the most sensible reasoning. Anyways. I just can&#39;t stop thinking about it all the time and I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m the only one it seems truly bothered by this constantly</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
