I watch American movies, British movies, hell even Netflix shows like maybe squid games and I really couldn&#39;t care less if they include someone from my country, my region, me ethnic group, or my skin colour. Yes there are white people in the movie but assuming that I&#39;d identify with that just cuz of skin colour is actually pretty small minded. Mention of my country is always cool, but I don&#39;t care in the slightest. What do you think? Do we really need to represent every race / ethinc group / whatever in every big movie / series?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
