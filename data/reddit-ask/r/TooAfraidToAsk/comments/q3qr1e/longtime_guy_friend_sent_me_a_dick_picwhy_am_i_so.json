I have no attraction to him at all, and I’ve said I’m not interested in dating…especially not now….\nSo yesterday, I open up his message on Snapchat and there it is. His dick. And not just a picture…oh no. It was a video.\nI was so shocked and pissed that he would just do that. Then I just had the overwhelming urge to cry. I felt violated somehow.\nI feel like I’m majorly overreacting…but now I don’t even want to talk to him. I don’t understand why he thought something like that would be okay. Especially with the situation I’m in with being newly divorced. I feel violated and completely disrespected.\nAm I overreacting?\nBut also, why do guys do this shit?!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
