How do couples forego protection, ejaculate inside of the woman, then act shocked &amp; surprised when the woman becomes pregnant? Do people not understand how pregnancy happens? Obviously I&#39;m not talking about couples that use contraceptives only to have them fail. I&#39;m talking about people who actively avoid the use of contraceptives. If I drive while under the influence of alcohol &amp; I get into an accident, I&#39;m not going to act bewildered that my actions caused an accident. There&#39;s a chance it <em>won&#39;t</em> happen, but there&#39;s a chance it <em>will</em> so I can&#39;t be surprised if it does. I&#39;m sorry if I sound bitter, but a family friend just got the news he&#39;s going to be a dad &amp; he&#39;s freaking out about it because he doesn&#39;t want kids. I understand deception happens, but from what he&#39;s told us, he &amp; she consciously didn&#39;t use protection.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
