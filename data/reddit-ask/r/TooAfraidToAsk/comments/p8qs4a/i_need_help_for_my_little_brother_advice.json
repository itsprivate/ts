And then I was like &quot;yeah that&#39;s awesome! What was the bet about?&quot; Then, he told me that she would give 5 bucks to him, if he could get a girl to send him personally a nude pic, so, he contacted (on reddit) a girl that posts nude on reddit and claimed to be an artist and asked her for a free nude pic to make an artwork, the girl accepted and she sent the nude by email on a secondary email address of my brother. So he won the bet. After he told me the full story i was like &quot;dude! Congrats!&quot; and we just laughed and joked for the rest of the day. But when I was about to sleep, the adult instinct kicked in and i thought &quot;shit, he shouldn&#39;t have done it, he&#39;s a minor after all, he&#39;s smart and all, but still a minor&quot; so i woke up this morning with the intention to tell him to not do that again, but I am trying to find the right way to tell him, i don&#39;t wanna be too harsh since he is in a bad moment right now, but i don&#39;t wanna be too soft either. What should I tell him? And second question, should I tell my mom? Shes gonna beat the shit outta me even if I&#39;m 26, i introduced him to reddit like a year ago. Are we in some kind of trouble? He and his sister are staying with me in this period so I&#39;m the adult of the situation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
