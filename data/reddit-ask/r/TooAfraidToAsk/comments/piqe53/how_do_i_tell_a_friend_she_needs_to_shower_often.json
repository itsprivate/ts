She’s the most fun person to be around and I love talking to her but she STINKS. I’ve been slightly telling her some of my hygiene tips and what I do along with breaking his down like showering everyday, flossing, using mouthwash and washing your work clothes everyday. So that hopefully it will rub off on her and she’ll get the hint that she needs to shower more but it’s not working. We have sleepovers at my house and that seems like the only way I can get her to shower. She didn’t one time and I could smell straight butt and vagina the whole night. I even offer to do her hair and at least brush it for her. We got to talking and she straight up told me that she wont shower for 5 days because she gets lazy. I bluntly told her how gross it is and she just brushed it off. I love her to death but she smells and looks filthy all the time and it’s quite embarrassing when we go out. Can someone give me some tips as to how I can tell her in a sensitive way without hurting her feelings that she needs to take showers??</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
