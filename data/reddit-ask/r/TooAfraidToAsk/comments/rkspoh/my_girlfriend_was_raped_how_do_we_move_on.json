  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was across the country on work travel when my girlfriend (Jane Doe) decided to go out to dinner with a few of her friends. When she arrived, she noticed her ex boyfriend (John Doe) was also invited and had shown up. John proceeded to get incredibly drunk and was unable to drive home. Jane wanted to be the bigger person and drive John back to his house so he wasn&amp;#39;t left stranded. They arrived at his house and she helped him get inside. From there things got heated. Their previous relationship was toxic and John insisted on touching her and getting physical. Sparing the details, Jane was raped - full vaginal sex. She did not fight back, rather just sobbed throughout and accepted what was happening to her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came back from work travel 3 days later. She tells me this story in tears driving back from the airport. This is her third rape (first one with me as her partner). Through some internet detective work, I am able to find the guys facebook and place of employment - I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with this information. I feel a mixture of guilt, livid anger, terror, and uncertainty for the future of our relationship. I don&amp;#39;t know how we are supposed to move past this as a couple and return to our normal life after this. He took away something that was supposed to be an intimate act between two loving people forced it upon her with violence - tarnishing the magic of sex. My sex drive is at an all time low just thinking about it. Jane does not want to file a report, she tried with her previous two offenders and claims it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything (she lost the restraining order hearing both times). How do I/we move past this as a couple?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
