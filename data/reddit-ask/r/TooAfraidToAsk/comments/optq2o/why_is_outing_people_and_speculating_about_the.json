There are literally two possible outcomes. Either the person in question is the sexuality they claim to be and you‚Äôre bringing undue attention to their sexuality through baseless speculation, or, probably even worse, the person is gay or bi and is hiding their sexuality and you‚Äôre bringing attention to it before they‚Äôre ready to discuss it. These are both bad outcomes with no benefit to you whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>Say you‚Äôre right and someone really is hiding their sexuality. Congratulations, you played a part in shining a light on something they weren‚Äôt ready to publicly confront. </p>\n\n<p>Shouldn‚Äôt LGBT people be especially sensitive to the potential discomfort someone could have about their sexuality? You would think that, but everything I see from LGBT spaces makes me think the complete opposite. Why is this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
