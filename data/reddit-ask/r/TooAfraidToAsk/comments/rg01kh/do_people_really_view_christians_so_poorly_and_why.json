I guess I ignored it and don&amp;#39;t tell people I am christian, but I, a roman catholic always try to be as good a person as I can be. I try to be nice to everyone else and I try to make sure everyone else is happy. And I can say the same for the other few Christian friends I have. So why do people seem to hate the concept of Christianity and Christians so much? Genuine question out of curiosity I don&amp;#39;t want to stir the pot with this or anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t attack anyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
