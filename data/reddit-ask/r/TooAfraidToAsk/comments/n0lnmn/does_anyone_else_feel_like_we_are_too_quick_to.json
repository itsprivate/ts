There are certainly race issues, but it doesn’t seem like many people are addressing actual facts and most of the information I see circulated is anecdotal. I personally don’t see any good in touting something as racism unless there is clear evidence that suggests that, because otherwise you can claim any altercation between two races is fueled by racism. Just saying that it feels like racism seems like a useless argument to me. I think these movements get pushed and everyone jumps on because people have the urge to get up in arms and pin the blame on something and it’s easy to do that when you boil events down to racism. What’s more is it’s difficult to call out some of this behavior without being labeled a racist yourself. I find it difficult to bring this up because it seems like few people around share this concern. Does anyone agree or maybe have some other perspective they would like to share?",
