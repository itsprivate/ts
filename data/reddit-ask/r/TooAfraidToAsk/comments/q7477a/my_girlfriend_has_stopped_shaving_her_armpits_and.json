My girlfriend had always been on and off about shaving her armpits regularly which I was fine with early on when we first started seeing each other - at least she kept up on it every now and then. But recently, she just kinda stopped and she essentially has full bushes beneath her arms, and it&#39;s secretly begun to really bother me.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>She says she lets it go because it&#39;s not a big deal, nobody really sees it, is starting to kind of &quot;like it&quot;. I know it&#39;s her body but it&#39;s honestly extremely unattractive and distracting to me.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The thing is that I feel like I keep up my appearance and personal grooming in a frequency and manner that suits her preferences, because I naturally like to be considerate of how my loved one views and prefers me. So, I feel like something like this should be a small favor to return and something she should be willing to make an effort at for me. Obviously my attraction to her doesn&#39;t hinge on just this; she&#39;s very attractive to me otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I get that she shouldn&#39;t have to cater everything to me, and I really don&#39;t make any effort to control her appearance in any other way because I like her individuality but is there any way I could convey my feelings on this to her in a way that would be constructive?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Just as a preemptive aside, I get that body hair is natural etc., but my preferences are still my own and I can&#39;t just flip them off. This also obviously isn&#39;t something I would see myself breaking up over either.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Just wondering how others would approach this?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have made passing comments about it to no real avail but never really fully brought it up to her yet. Also, I can&#39;t say for sure, but just knowing her, I do feel like at least a small part of keeping it beyond just liking it is driven by the urge to make a kind of political statement or trying to be &quot;free from gender norms&quot; just for the sake of it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
