(Throwaway btw)</p>\n\n<p>But anyway on to context. My boyfriend and I have pretty much been spending time almost exclusively with each other since the start of the pandemic with very little time socializing outside the house as his family is local and very high risk. Now that we&#39;re all vaccinated and feeling safer, I&#39;ve been starting to have a much more active social life with my childhood friends who have moved to the area. However, my boyfriend only knows a few people in the area and hasn&#39;t kept in touch, nor is he trying to meet new friends or start a social life. This is likely because he&#39;s very stressed and busy, but he is also quite lonely and craving a circle of friends again.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been inviting him to some of my plans with my friends, but not all of them. While we&#39;ve had friend groups in common before, my group of childhood friends is kinda more of &quot;my&quot; group. He gets along with them, but he doesn&#39;t quite click with them on a deeper level like I do and is more casual friends with them. Tbh, I&#39;ve been finding it really refreshing to hang out with my friends just as myself rather than as a couple thats glued to the hip and operates as one person, and its nice to not feel like I need to be a buffer for my boyfriend to make sure he&#39;s entertained or finding people to talk to.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to think that its normal and even healthy to be able to go out and socialize without always having and inviting your SO to everything you do or every group of friends you make, but I&#39;ve also seen a lot of people say the contrary that as a couple, you become a unit and are expected to be invited together to any event or gathering. Is it wrong of me to be hanging out with friends without my boyfriend? Even if they&#39;re not really friends in common and are mostly friends with me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
