I rehearse conversations I&amp;#39;m about to have, I re-do conversations I just had, I practice anecdotes, I will talk as though someone asked me a question and answer it. These aren&amp;#39;t big or important things either, and most of the time I never end up talking about this stuff because it&amp;#39;s all in my head. Imagine all the things I could do if I dedicated half my brain power to something else. Sometimes it makes me feel inauthentic because if I&amp;#39;m talking to someone for real, it feels weird because it isn&amp;#39;t a genuine reaction - I&amp;#39;ve probably gone over and over this moment already. Am I the only one?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
