But... has anyone else sort of had the opposite experience?\n\nI'm not talking like your sibling was so toxic that you had to cut them off, because that would be a different situation, but does anyone else just sort of have a really \"meh\" bond with their sibling? Like with my sister, even after many years, I just don't really know her that well and even though she's family, she just feels kind of like a stranger. And it's not because she's a bad person or either of us dislike each other, we just find it kind of boring to be around the other. When we were kids we would fight a lot, I think possibly even more than the average siblings, and since we never really had a real bond, when she moved away it just kind of completely fizzled. She feels like an acquaintance at best that I can have lukewarm small talk with.\n\nI'm fine with that, I'm perfectly fine with just calling on birthdays and having 5 minute conversations with her, but I was wondering, is it the same with anyone else? You never really found your sibling to be your best friend or your worst enemy, they were just sort of... there? I feel like I can't really ask this question in real life, because everyone always expects everyone to have either a wonderful or absolutely horrible relationship with their family. And whenever I've said it out loud, people always sort of look down on me for not being super super close to my sibling.\n\nBut I really want to know, since I never see it shown online or in TV shows, does anyone else have the same experience? It's just sort of a \"meh\" bond with your sibling? They just kind of feel like a coworker you wouldn't really be interested in hanging out with, but you're fine with seeing occasionally?",
