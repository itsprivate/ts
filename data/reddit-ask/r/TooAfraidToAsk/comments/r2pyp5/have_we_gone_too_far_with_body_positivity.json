To love your body is one thing but to legitimise it to the point that you don&#39;t try to get fit is a whole different hypocritical space brands/people/influencers are owning. Everyone&#39;s favourite thing to say is, But I can dance, so I&#39;m fit. But are you dancing away the triglycerides, too? As someone who suffers from hypothyroidism,  I am a little familiar with the amount of effort it takes to not put on weight. So, I&#39;m obviously not talking about those who put on weight owing to some underlying condition. But I do think there is a huge population of plain unhealthy people with poor lifestyle who go the extra mile in the discourse of &quot;embracing your body&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear your views, and change mine where I&#39;m wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am not talking about pointing it out to anyone or &quot;shaming&quot; them in anway. I&#39;m simply asking is it ok to not encourage this thinking?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
