When a man and a woman are arguing about whatever it is they&#39;re arguing about (regardless of whatever the circumstances are), the woman would try to escalate and physically assaults him when it is proven that he did absolutely nothing wrong beforehand... and then they get surprised and even more pissed and call him out for hitting her when all he did was defend himself (which is a perfectly natural response). This is just something I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever understood. I mean, y&#39;all women know this is very much not legal, yet some of you do it anyway. I just don&#39;t understand this logic.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, I don&#39;t endorse men being the aggressor against a woman in any way just like how I don&#39;t endorse the other way around. Even if a woman hits you first, and what you do in response is send her to the hospital, then that makes you the aggressor by default. So if they try to start a fight with you, it only makes sense, and it is perfectly legal that you only treat them accordingly. I know some of y&#39;all are going to say &quot;Oh just be the bigger man and walk away!&quot; Yeah no. That doesn&#39;t work 100 percent of the time. </p>\n\n<p>So in general, this is just something that I never understood, and I&#39;m hoping that some of you could shed some light on this and help me alongside others understand. And if there are some tips about situations like this that you feel we should know about, then please feel free to share.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
