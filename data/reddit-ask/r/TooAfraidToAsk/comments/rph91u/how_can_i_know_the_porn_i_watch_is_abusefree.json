Also, trigger warning I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I read a thread on &lt;a href=\"/r/greentext\"&gt;r/greentext&lt;/a&gt; about the GirlsDoPorn case. What I found was some of the most despicable things I ever read. Rape, doxxing, suicide and lots of awful things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I became a bit paranoid on how much of the porn I consumed was indeed rape or abusive, so I stopped watching porn altogether. I never really consumed hardcore porn, casting couches or the ones where they pick up people from the street, mostly because I assumed those are the most shady. But apart of that, I truly don&amp;#39;t know how to tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to see which producers are abusive? Are there production houses that abide to safe porn? Or maybe I should just keep going and never watch porn again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if it seems a bit alarmist but the thought of me enjoying others pain is something that scares me and want to avoid it as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for everything. Have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
