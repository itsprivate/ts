They have been constantly telling me different theories trying to drill an idea into my head that the vaccine is bad, though I know it isn’t the case. I don’t want to disappoint them or make them upset at the same time either because I still love my parents.</p>\n\n<p>Just looking for advice I don’t want to get political on this, thanks guys</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
