Me and my partner always wipe everything and shower post-sex, before getting to the shower we use tissues to stop any ‘leakage’. There’s no wet spot unless we were very sweaty and even then, just switching positions can help avoid that. </p>\n\n<p>Is this not standard?

I have little sexual experience so I’m not sure what the ‘societal norm’ is, but I would very much like to know.</p>\n\n<p>Also this is my post ever, pls b gentle.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
