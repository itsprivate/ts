More discreet: I absolutely hate going into someones bathroom and unleashing a stream of piss so loud that everyone in the house can hear it. Sitting while peeing is near silent.\n\n2. Less mess/more hygienic: standing to pee has a lot of room for error. Even if you don't miss any, the splashing will undoubtedly get on the rim of the toilet or farther. Sitting is cleaner. You also don't have to touch your dick at all.\n\n3. Less of a chance of falling in: I don't know about you, but on a few late night trips to the bathroom to drop the kids off at the pool, I've gone to sit down only to realize too late that the seat is up. Any chance of quickly falling back asleep is ruined when your life flashes before your eyes.\n\n4. More courteous: the women in your house will think you put the seat down for them *every time* without fail. Major brownie points.\n\n5. More convenient: if you've got to go number 1 and 2 at the same time, it's possible with more ease than ever!\n\nLet me know if you guys think I'm insane or not.",
