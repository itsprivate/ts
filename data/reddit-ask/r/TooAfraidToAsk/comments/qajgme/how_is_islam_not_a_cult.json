I grew up in a muslim household and was taught Islam. I know the subject. I&#39;m also not trying to insult muslims. They are free to believe whatever they want.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway like I said, my parents taught me Islam as a kid which made me a &quot;muslim&quot;. But, as I matured and got to do my own research on religion, I discovered many things about Islam which conflicted with my personal set of beliefs and morals.</p>\n\n<p>I also realized that what we are told when we&#39;re kids about Islam is basically &quot;the good stuff&quot; while all the dark, violent, discriminating parts of it are cast aside until you&#39;re too deep in the religious psyche to actually question it.</p>\n\n<p>Which makes me ask this question: how is Islam not considered a cult ?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a complete and thorough brain washing of (young) minds that makes them adhere to extreme ignorant ideas that at best lead to discrimination and at worst to abhorrent violence.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also completely against any modernization and insists on applying every word of the Quran as is, because it&#39;s seen as the literal word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Even questioning such concepts is considered blasphemy and apostasy. And guess what, apostates are to be executed, most Islamic scholars say (there is a hadith -a Muhammad quote- which indicates the death penalty for ex muslims).</p>\n\n<p>I have seen first hand what Islam does to a society. My country is deeply misogynistic and antisemitic. Don&#39;t even get me started on homophobia. Average people here rely on faith healers more often than they do on physicians, especially when it comes to psychiatric pathologies. They firmly believe in eccentric paranormal phenomenons such as sorcery and possessions and get extremely hostile against anyone who isn&#39;t muslim.\nRecently, with the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, I have seen a vast majority of my fellow countrymen cheer for the Taliban and wish for such a fate to our nation. Because apparently we strayed too far from God, hence why we are poor and &quot;rotten&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So really, what makes this religion &quot;typical&quot; ? Why is it considered okay ? How is Islam not a cult ?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
