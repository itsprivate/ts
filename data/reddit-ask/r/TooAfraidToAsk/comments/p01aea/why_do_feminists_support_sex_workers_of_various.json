If I wanted to learn about sex slavery and trafficking, I would&#39;ve asked about that. This is a question about a situation like in the Netherlands and the Amsterdam red light district, or professional escorts, not some Vietnamese underground sex dungeon for pedos. If you want to answer in regard to sex slavery and rape then this is not a thread for that. This is strictly about women who decide on their own to pursue that line of work, be it they want money or they like it.\nIf someone is raped, abused or forced to do things against their will, then it is 1000% deplorable. But I am not asking about those situations. Not about some lawless hellscape in some part of the world where people don&#39;t give a fuck about human rights, but a civilized business transaction between two consenting adults, consenting being the key word. No physical or psychological abuse on any side. I agree that there are numerous instances where sex workers are abused, but, to reiterate, we are talking about the, rare or not, instances where they used their free will to do those things without coercion. No pimps involved, just type of self employment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
