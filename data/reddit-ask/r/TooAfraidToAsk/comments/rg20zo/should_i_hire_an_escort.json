  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (34m) have been devastatingly single for at least a decade. My last girlfriend and real relationship was when I was 22 with only about half a dozen random flings thrown in here and there since. I’m an introvert for sure but I have learned how to be sociable and am very comfortable being extroverted, even without alcohol. I’m fairly personable, affable and truly enjoy interacting and relating with people. I also, very fortunately have a healthy, broad and diverse friend group and on top of that, the majority of my friends are women. I definitely want a long-term, monogamous girlfriend, probably more than anything else. While it’s been hard being single for so long I have coped with the perspective that at least I am not in a mediocre/stale or even toxic relationship like I see most of my peers in. Pretty much I’m bummed I don’t have a significant other but at least I’m not settling. The pertinent problem though is sex. I have a healthy libido but I have been going years between getting laid. So for the past couple of months I have been researching and seriously considering hiring an escort. My main deterrent is sex trafficking but looking at the profiles of the more higher end providers I’m feeling pretty ok about it morally. Just hoping for some input one way or the other before I pull the trigger&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
