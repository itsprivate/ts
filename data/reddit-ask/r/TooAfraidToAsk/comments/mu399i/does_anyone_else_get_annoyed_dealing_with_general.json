I just get annoyed sometimes with the general maintenance the human body requires.  For example, when I'm starting to feel tired and it's getting late, I never actually want to go to sleep, but I know that I have to because I need to sleep.  Sleep takes up a lot of time, and I want to use all of that time to do things, so whenever I go to sleep I'm usually thinking to myself \"damn, I wish I was already awake tomorrow\".  Same thing with simple hygiene like brushing my teeth or taking a shower.  It's time I want to be using to do other things, but instead I have to dedicate some part of my day solely to cleaning my body.  I still do it, but it's one of those things I just want to be over ASAP so I can get back to my life.  There are so many little things that take up time like shaving, clipping nails, brushing hair, etc., and I've always felt like \"damn, I really gotta take up some time during my day just to make sure that I don't end up all gross and smelly\".  And yes, I realize that these things (aside from sleep) take up very little time in the whole of a day, but it still makes me feel annoyed that I have to spend time on them instead of spending time on what I want.  Does anyone else feel this way, or am I just a little weird?",
