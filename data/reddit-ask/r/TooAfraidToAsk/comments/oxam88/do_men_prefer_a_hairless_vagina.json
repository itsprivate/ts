I wouldn&#39;t have much of a problem with doing it but for a hairy woman whose hair grows back fairly quickly, it&#39;s just not worth it for stubble to show up the next day. and not only does it take so much time and then grows back very soon, when it starts growing back its so damn itchy. just overall its not really worth it for me so I&#39;m always wondering if men are going to be unhappy with it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you everyone for the lovely replies! I definitely feel more secure in my choices now, I&#39;m also glad to know that I&#39;m not the only woman who finds shaving a hassle. have a good day/night guys!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
