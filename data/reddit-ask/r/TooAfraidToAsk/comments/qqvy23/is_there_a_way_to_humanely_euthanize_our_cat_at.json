We were going to take her to my father in laws for thanksgiving for her to live out the rest of her days before passing on but this morning she seems to be in a good amount of pain and can barely walk. Over night she really seemed to of taken a down turn. I only have one vet office within a 2 hour drive and they won’t see any pets (even euthanasia) unless a prior appointment and that’s usually two weeks out. I do hunt but I don’t have any close public hunting grounds or areas I could shoot at to put her down that way, nor do I really think I could despite trying to think of something that would be very quick for her. It would be too hard I think for me mentally. </p>\n\n<p>So is there anything I can do humanely at home? Sleeping pills? Anything? I wouldn’t want to give her anything that would just cause her more sickness or pain. It’s a messed up question but I don’t know who ask or what to do. I just don’t want her to suffer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
