I need get out of my house, have a reason to see people, interact, and be outside. </p>\n\n<p>Being able to commute, be out in the city gives me reason to just be outdoors and see the world, no matter how banal it can be. I don&#39;t want to restrict that to time where I don&#39;t work (weekend) </p>\n\n<p>Obviously it&#39;s necessary during these times, but people seem to want to stay that way. Why?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Maybe I should have posted this in <a href=\"/r/unpopularopinion\">r/unpopularopinion</a>. I&#39;d like to clarify things for people that seem slightly offended. I don&#39;t wish for people who like working from home, to have to go to work. I had to work from home in 2020, luckily this year I haven&#39;t, so I&#39;m fine. If everyone wants to continue to stay at home working, I&#39;m not against that. For me at that time working from home was miserable and I hated it. I was just curious how people feel about it. </p>\n\n<p>To the few people kind enough to pm me with slurs, I apologize if I hurt you with my question.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Reading everyone&#39;s comments has been truly interesting, and I definitely see how it all comes down to circumstances and the different situations we all are in. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I&#39;d like to mention, I keep seeing how people think I&#39;m an extrovert or people lover. Funny enough it&#39;s the opposite! I don&#39;t like people just as much as everyone else claiming to hate humanity. Importantly I like separating work life and home life, and it&#39;s hard to do  when I&#39;m working at home. I like being in this space where I never have to think about work. A buffer, a gap, a space in-between those two things. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that everyone can get the work environment they thrive in best!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
