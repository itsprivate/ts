Heck, she’s the first girl I’ve ever thought of proposing too. My mother literally lost her mind. She went on a rant how the science is against it and how it’ll make our kids “umpure”. Keep in mind I am still in high school. My grandfather found out and said some things that make me never want to speak with him again. My mother also said that our kids will be at danger due to society not accepting it. Just curious if there’s actually any science to back up anything that my mother or grandfather said. Thanks, and I hope this doesn’t offend anyone in anyway.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
