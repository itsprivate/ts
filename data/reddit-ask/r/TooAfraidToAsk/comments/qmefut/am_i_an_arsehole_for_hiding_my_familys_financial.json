It was a girl who said her bf had lied to her about his family having money and she was pissed off and wanted to break it off with him. Everyone was on her side, saying to leave him immediately and that he couldn&#39;t be trusted, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is, I do this. Not to the extent that the guy did in the post I saw (she said he was inventing stories of them being extremely poor and making her pay for things, claiming he had no money and such, for five solid years). In my case I usually hold off for about a year as far as actually taking them to my parents&#39; house and them getting to see it etc. I live in a pretty normal flat, drive a 7 year old car, and I don&#39;t pretend to be skint or anything, I&#39;m just an average university student basically. I never make girls pay for anything but I don&#39;t flaunt in any way that I have more money than any normal person. I just sort of leave out the details I don&#39;t want them to know, and put off showing them anything that could give it away. </p>\n\n<p>I did this with my current gf and she did seem a bit confused by it at first but after I explained why she seemed to understand. I do it because if I&#39;m really into a girl, I want to be sure she actually likes ME, and isn&#39;t just tolerating me thinking I&#39;m her personal ATM. My gf seems to have reacted well, we&#39;re still together and she appears to still trust me. The only issue was it seemed like it made her kind of insecure for awhile. But I haven&#39;t noticed it lately. </p>\n\n<p>If what I&#39;m doing is wrong, what should I do instead to weed out people who wouldn&#39;t want to date me except for the money thing?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
