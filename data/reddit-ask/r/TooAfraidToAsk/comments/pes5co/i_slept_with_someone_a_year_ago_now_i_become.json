Back then, we had sex after a party at our mutual friend&#39;s party. We both weren&#39;t stupidly drunk, just little bit tipsy. It was a build-up since we had been flirting since the party started. We were talking and ended up fucking inside a guest room.\n---fast foward one year---\nI met a woman randomly while buying coffee and we became friends not long after. She shared a story that she has a husband (married for 3 years) and they been trying to have a baby for the last 2 years. When they started to try to have a baby, her husband became so easily to get jealous and it&#39;s been stressing her out. Her phone lighted up when she got a message, I saw her lock screen picture and suddenly I had the urge to throw up. I tried to hold myself and asked her &quot;awww how cute both of you! is that him?&quot; and she said &quot;thank you! yes this is him&quot;. IT WAS THE GUY WHO I HAD SEX WITH AROUND LAST YEAR!\nI knew it right away it was him because of the same piercing on his nose, but I needed to make sure it was the same guy so I asked for his name. SAME NAME! Oh god....</p>\n\n<p>Hearing the fact that she&#39;s been stressing out that her husband gets jealous easily started 2 years ago and the fact that I had sex with him last year......it makes me angry and sad. Please give me some advices, should I tell her? We&#39;ve known each other like, one month! Am I invading their privacy by telling her my story? Should I just keep it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
