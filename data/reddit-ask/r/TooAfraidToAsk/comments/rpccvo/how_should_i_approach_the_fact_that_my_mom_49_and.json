  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom went on a trip cross country. My younger brothers 22 and 17 are now under my supervision. We tend to eat out but when I cook they complain. I spend a lot of money buying groceries for them and spend hours cooking. They tend to judge and make fun of the food. Either saying it’s not good or that it could be better. Basically eat everything and insult me. I taste my food, I know when it’s good or bad. My mom also does the same thing and has turned it into my personality. She goes out of her way to compliment my brothers food in-front of me even when it’s too salty or undercooked. When I don’t cook they get upset, when I cook the insult me. I’m tired and have decided I don’t want to cook for them anymore. My mom and I got into an argument over it. I don’t want to cook for people I can’t please, who insult me, and break my confidence. I don’t even like cooking for my bf because I’m now insecure about it and unsure if I can actually cook or if I’m just being teased by them. It’s excessive and starting to get on my nerves. Should I continue this route or do you guys have other ways of approaching this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
