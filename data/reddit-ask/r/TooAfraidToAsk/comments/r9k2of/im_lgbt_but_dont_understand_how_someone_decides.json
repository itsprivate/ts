  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I ask a genuine question? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s sex is female. I grew up wanting to be a boy. I wanted my breasts to not be there because they ruined the aesthetic I wanted. I had feelings for girls from a young age. I felt far more comfortable around boys and felt uncomfortable around girls. Being strong physically has always been a value of mine. I have never had any maternal desire to either give birth or be a mother. As I got older I struggled accepting all these masculine traits about myself due to feeling like I had to conform to my parents ideologies and societies expectations. I feel like I can really really relate to a lot of the non binary experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m in my 30’s I accept my masculine side fully but I also love my feminine qualities. I am still envious of the male form and I doubt that will ever change. It just took me a long time to realise that i was no less of a woman even though I related so strongly to males/male traits and the lack of wanting to be a mother. It was my own feelings about what a woman should be and what a man should be that caused my distress and confusion. Once I stopped caring about society’s views and  realised that I was no less of a woman everything fell into place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no need to disagree with the biological science. There has been research that states that the level of masculinity and likelyhood of a woman being a tomboy comes down to how much testosterone they are exposed to after conception. This suggests that biology does in fact contribute to gender and possibly expression. I fully accept that I am a woman both biologically and in gender even though I express myself in masculine ways, for example, the way I dress or even sit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like had I had that education and definitely therapy or at least some who I could trust to talk to then I could have understood and accepted far quicker. It would have saved me a lot of misery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where I struggle to understand and would really like an open minded response. What is the difference between me and someone that feels the need to go one step further to identify as non binary, use terms such as AFAB, AMAB(which to me suggests the view that doctors determine sex and gender not biology), and go on to create pronouns?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it reasonable to suggest that a person who identifies as non binary is locked in their own beliefs about what a man should be and what a woman should be. therefore because they can’t accept their own personal anomalies within their gender or lack therapy to work through their beliefs, they then feel forced to look for alternative solutions such as the labels of non binary and gender fluid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not looking to upset anyone. Please don’t respond unless you want a mature open and honest conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
