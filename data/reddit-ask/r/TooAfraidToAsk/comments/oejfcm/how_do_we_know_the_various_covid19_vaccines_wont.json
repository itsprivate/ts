If the first vaccines have been out for a year or so and were rushed to hospitals as an emergency, surely they haven&#39;t had long term testing.</p>\n\n<p>If a medicine for the common cold came out tomorrow, but had no long term testing, I would be concerned. Theres been plenty of times that things that seemed great at the time turned out to be a problem in the future (Asbestos was great, until it wasn&#39;t. Thalidomide seemed to be the perfect way to cure morning sickness, until it caused huge complications.).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in a bit of a rut, I don&#39;t believe the ridiculous conspiracies that some throw out, but how can we be sure there won&#39;t be an issue that arises in the future? Theres been plenty of medications that seem to work wonders (i.e male birth control pill) that end up failing long term trials, yet how has a vaccine made within a year and a half had that long term testing?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any information that can educate me further on the matter, seems it&#39;s hard to ask questions these days without running into misinformation or being labled an anti-vaxxer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
