Also, occult magic and stuff like that is super interesting.\n\nI went to a magic shop today with some friends where they sold crystals to heal you or give you luck and shit, they had tarot cards, books on witch stuff and the occult. I found it super interesting and cool and the shop keep was really interesting to listen to and talk about it. However, I don't believe in it all. I don't think tarot cards can tell the future and witches don't exist. Yet, it's just super cool to learn about. I wanted to buy some stuff there but I needed to save.\n\nWith religion, I don't believe in any of it but I look at it the same way I look at folk tales from different cultures and learning about different philosophies. I love learning about tales from different cultures, I love learning about their history and I treat religions as the same.\n\nFrom small tribal cults to global religion, the stories that are told in them are just really neat stories that kind of just got out of hand and people began taking them seriously. There was this video Wendigoon made and it was a Christianity Iceberg and I highly recommend it, it proves that Christianity as a story and lore is super interesting and that's the same for all religions for me. Its not real, just cool stories. Eastern philosophy and religion are super cool to learn about too. It's literally the same feeling I get learning about video game or movie lores. \n\nPlus, religion does have good life lessons in them that are true. I just don't think it's real. Sorry, I'm rambling but does anyone think like me here?",
