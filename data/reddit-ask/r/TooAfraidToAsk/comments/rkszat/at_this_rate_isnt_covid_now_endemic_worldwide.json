  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to preface this by saying I am fully vaxxed + booster and I wear my mask out in public everywhere, and I encouraged my hesitant parents to get the vaccine, etc. I want people to make safe choices for them and everyone around them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But its been two years now and 2022 will just be the same. Tons of people everywhere will always refuse the vaccine and refuse masks. Pretty much anyone who hasn’t gotten the vaccine by now will never get it. People will continue to fight against mask mandates etc. We will never get 100% cooperation at fighting covid, and especially as new variants evolve it will continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the flu, people with covid who do get vaxxed and boosters may have to go to the hospital. My mom had confirmed Flu and not covid last year, and even though she had gotten her flu shot, she almost needed to go to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s awful that so many people have died from covid, and that so many of those were preventable. But are we really going to be like this 2 years from now? 5 years? At this rate aren’t we going to end up having yearly boosters just like the flu? When will the world move on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, as this drags out, my mental health continues to decline. People in my area are still hesitant to go out and when I go out it doesnt feel the same. It’s been extraordinarily difficult to make friends when everyone’s either at home or wearing masks, and loneliness is taking a big toll on me. Virtual calls like Zoom make me feel like im talking to an AI or something, i need a real person in front of me. I dont see local leaders taking into account mental health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me knows the right thing to do is be as safe as possible for the sake of everyone else. But another part of me is just exhausted and I want the world to move on….&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
