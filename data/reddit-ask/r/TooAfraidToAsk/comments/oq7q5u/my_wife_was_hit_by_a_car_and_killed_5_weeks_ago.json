  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This happened 5 weeks ago.  She was out by herself in the everglades on a 2 lane gravel road and had her truck stopped with her hazards on. While she was walking around her truck, a car came speeding by and hit her, throwing her body about 20-30 feet from her truck. Died instantly we&#39;re told. Here is what we do know so far... her truck was running with the lights on, it was dusk, around 8:30 at night.</p>\n\n<p>Her truck was facing east, the car was heading west. The story goes, she was walking around back to her driver door, she came out of no where and the car hit her at full speed. The speed limit out there is 20, but they suspect he was doing atleast 40. His licence was revoked 3 years ago for refusing a dui test. It was not his car, it was his parents car. He also had alcohol in his system, and since he was taken to the hospital for a headache(I believe he was just trying to avoid going to jail that night) they automatically took his blood for the toxicology, which has not come back yet after 5 weeks. As of right now he is a free man still. </p>\n\n<p>Here are my concerns. This may have been 50/50 to blame here. My wife not paying attention, and this man driving too fast without a licence and some type of narcotics in his system. Whenever we are in the glades and see a parked car, we always slow down and go around them because you never know whats behind the vehicle, a deer, my wife etc.  This tragedy was 100% avoidable on his end. This is a 33 year old man who still lives at home with his parents, no car, no licence, nothing to sue over. Is he going to prison for this? Are the family liable for letting him drive their vehicle on a revoked licence?</p>\n\n<p>To add insult to injury, this man comes from a very fucked up family. Just a few years ago his brother was shot and killed by police after trying to attack a cop with a screwdriver. His family successfully sued the county it happened at and won $550,000. Yet the idiot brother kills my wife, still free from prison, and all I am getting so far is a lousy $25k from their car insurance company, which my lawyer is getting a huge chunk already. Life fucking sucks. Can anyone enlighten me and give me some hope that maybe some justice will come out of this in the end? I know the investigation is still ongoing and I am being a little impatient but I am a widowed father of two now getting royally fucked while his family can walk free and kill and sue anyone they want and get away with it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: If this is the wrong sub for this subject, or if anyone can recomend another sub for additional info that would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
