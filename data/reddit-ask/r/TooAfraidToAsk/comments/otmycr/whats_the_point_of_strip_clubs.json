How do people not get a boner? But what I really don’t get is, why would someone go to a strip club just to see? Wouldn’t it be better to get some? Aka go to a regular club, get a few numbers etc etc.? </p>\n\n<p>Next topic: private dances. </p>\n\n<p>Yo lmao if I don’t see the point of strip clubs, much less private dances. I REALLY don’t see how anyone does not get a boner from that, essentially you’re just blueballing yourself throughout the whole experience and idk about you guys but personally, being blueballed doesn’t feel pleasant</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
