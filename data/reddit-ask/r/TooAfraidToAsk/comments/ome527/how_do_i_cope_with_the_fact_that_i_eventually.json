(this was all part time) I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life and I realize that I eventually have to be like most adults and go to school and eventually get a job/career.\nI can barely emotionally handle a part time job how do I accept that I will eventually work full time and just be an adult in general. I don’t know if I’m getting my thoughts across well enough so apologize for any confusion. :p</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
