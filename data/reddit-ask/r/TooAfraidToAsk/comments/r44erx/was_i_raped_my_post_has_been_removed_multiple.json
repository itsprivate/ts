But I&#39;ve been told by a few commenters that i was raped. I just want to ask here, hoping that the answer is no</p>\n\n<p>This is a little explicit, but bear with me. </p>\n\n<p>So i met person X via a dating app and we agreed to have some cuddling time and light sex. Before we met up, i did emphasized that i do not want penetrative sex/ no penetration and X agreed. </p>\n\n<p>After we met at place Z, we cuddled and stuff, then X started asking me if i had tried anal. I said no and im not ready for it, while X started to kiss and finger my ass. I retaliated and said no repeatedly and X continued for a while until i hit X hard on the face. So we went back to light stuff and i thought that was it.</p>\n\n<p>After some time, X pulled me over aggressively, put on a condom and penetrated me. I told X to stop as it was very painful, while X continues to push it in harder and explained that it was an attempt to prepare my ass for anal sex. I screamed NO, it is painful. As i was scared, i said... &quot;Use ur finger first&quot; (knowing that X might not give up). </p>\n\n<p>Slowly, i got used to it. Then we had anal sex.. At that point, it wasnt painful, but i didnt want it..(but i didnt verbalized) and i ignored X thrusting me. Except that it felt great and i was kinda moaning?? It felt like my body was dominated and wanted it, so i went along. I was confused. </p>\n\n<p>After we finished, i was kinda relieved that it was over? So we climaxed, cleaned and part ways.</p>\n\n<p>Idk if that is considered rape...? Just want to hear some thoughts on this...</p>\n\n<p>Here comes the weird part. When X texted and asked if the session was okay. I said it was great. I mean i said that cos i just didnt want any trouble or further complications. Ngl, it felt good, but i feel like burying this whole incident cos it felt &quot;good&quot;, although i didnt explicitly gave any consent.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts are like, since i kinda &quot;enjoyed&quot; it, maybe it wasn&#39;t rape? Idk..?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
