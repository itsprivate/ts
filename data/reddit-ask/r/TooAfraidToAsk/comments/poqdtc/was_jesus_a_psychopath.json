  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just read this book called Evil Religions Unmasked where the author made an analysis on the Sermon of the Mount. My question arose when I understood the evilness of Jesus’ preach “love your enemy.” In that phrase, we have two strong words, love and enemy. Be sure that if you have an enemy, he will never rest until killing you, don’t think he will avoid your presence, it’s like you are an American living in Afghanistan, ok? And about love, instead of telling my words, I use the own Jesus’ below.</p>\n\n<p>“But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.”</p>\n\n<p>Before this phrase, we read, “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” The meaning of Jesus’ “righteousness” is that above.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s put this in our true perspective.</p>\n\n<p>From Jesus’ teaching, if Hitler or any other dictator have told you to do all that evil to others you should do that, once, for Jesus, not only you must put yourself in the hands of your enemies, but everyone else because the aim is to reach “the kingdom of heaven.”</p>\n\n<p>So, for Jesus the fight against Hitler was wrong, people should have walked two miles with him, having him asked for one!</p>\n\n<p>To everyone who wants to tell me, “You need to interpret his sayings” I can tell you if you want to know how to interpret the Bible, read the book. And, please, remember that the first Christians did 100% which is in that sermon, so there is no way to deny the meaning of it.</p>\n\n<p>As my question left clear, I’m asking for a psychological analysis of him. Jesus’ “love your enemy” is so malevolent that people push for an “interpretation” trying to turn it into something good, since we have the word love, and you know, love is so good. Psychologically, this people’s behavior toward the Bible’s teachings seems like a wife’s that is being abused by an evil husband, but she tries to find herself wrong and her husband right and doing that due to a love of her, isn’t it?</p>\n\n<p>The author of that book made a Bible’s analysis in many aspects concluding that it’s a diabolic work to put all of us living in hell and, following the instructions of Jesus in that sermon our lives would become a hell. He understood that the purpose of Christianity is to put us to die on a cross, when and where we will discover in our last minute that who we are worshipping is actually a demon, as Jesus screamed, “Father, father, why have you forsaken me?” He concluded that Jesus was created by a demon.</p>\n\n<p>But the Sermon of the Mount doesn’t seem a commandment of Jesus’ God, it seems from his mind, and this is why I’m asking if he himself was a psychopath. More than this sermon we have other scaring words from him like in John 14, “Believe in God; also believe in me.” And “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” In Mathew 28 we read, “All authority in heaven and on Earth has been given to me.” What a modesty, ah?</p>\n\n<p>If you are a psychologist and facing someone speaking like Jesus, what would be your diagnosis of him?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, Jesus was a psychopath, could you imagine what a hell is this, advertising a psychopath as a savior? And people falling into it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
