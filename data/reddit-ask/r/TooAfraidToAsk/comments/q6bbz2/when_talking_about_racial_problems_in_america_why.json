These aren&#39;t real issues. These things are not killing innocent black people. Why do we spend so much time focusing on such trivial things that aren&#39;t affecting the lives of black people? I&#39;ll be fair, it is black people as well focusing on stupid shit like this, but I gotta be honest, anytime I hear somebody bitching about these stupid things, it&#39;s almost always from young white college kids who think they are making a difference in the world. Instead of talking about pointless shit like this, why aren&#39;t we talking about redlining, gentrification, police, inner city public schooling?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
