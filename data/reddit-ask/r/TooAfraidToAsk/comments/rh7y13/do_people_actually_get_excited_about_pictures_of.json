In reality, I don&amp;#39;t give two shits about that baby and most babies aren&amp;#39;t even that cute to me.  I love my sister&amp;#39;s kids and that&amp;#39;s about it.  I confessed this to my other child-free friends and they all agreed that they&amp;#39;re faking it.  One of my friends WITH kids said they were faking it because they understand that high of becoming a new parent, but they don&amp;#39;t think their co-worker&amp;#39;s baby is all that cute.  I&amp;#39;ve seen co-workers who go &amp;quot;show me pictures!&amp;quot; and their reaction feels genuine... but now I can&amp;#39;t trust anybody because I&amp;#39;m a liar too!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is--are we ALL faking it or are there people who genuinely enjoy seeing other people&amp;#39;s baby photos??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
