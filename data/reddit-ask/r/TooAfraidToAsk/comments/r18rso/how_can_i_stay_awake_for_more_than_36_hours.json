Any tips on how to make it work? I don&#39;t have family to run to anymore as they have passed during the pandemic and I also don&#39;t have friends as I am in a new location. I am on my own. Willing to work hard but would be thankful for your tips on how to make this happen.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am aware it is unhealthy but I just need to be able to pull this off for about 3 weeks to be able to afford treatment. The treatment will be good enough to last me for a year so I can continue to function without disability.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
