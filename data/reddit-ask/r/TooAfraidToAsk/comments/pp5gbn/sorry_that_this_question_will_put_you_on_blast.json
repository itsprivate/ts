I’m small compared to the average size, and while I don’t have a girlfriend now, it’s definitely a thought that I contemplate a lot especially for the future. At my age, 19-22, sex is a big thing for most people and especially in relationships, they crave that physical intimacy. I haven’t dated before and am still a virgin. So it’s a thought that I am constantly worried about, that my performance is a factor for whether or not a person of interest will or will not want to date me. I know that relationships are more than just sex but eventually it will and have to be brought up in any relationship. And I myself don’t want to be in an open relationship, but than I feel that’s me burdening my partner. \nFor people who have been in that position and have a successful relationship, how were you able to overcome it with your partner if sex is a big deal for them?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
