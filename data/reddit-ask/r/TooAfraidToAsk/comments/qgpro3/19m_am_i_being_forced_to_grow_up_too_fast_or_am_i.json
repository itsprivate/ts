I&#39;ve been working my new job for 2 months and I should have over 2k. But instead it was 1k and some extra. He told me I am working for nothing if I keep spending it.</p>\n\n<p>I told him all of this is just a process and I thought to myself I thought he knew this better than anyone. Bills of my own come up. Like I was forced to spend 229 for a new phone because my old one was losing support from boost mobile. And not to mention phone bill and unexpected shit. </p>\n\n<p>I just feel like shit is moving so fast and nothing is just gradual. I&#39;ve been working so much with 2 jobs that neglected cleaning my room. I was so fed up that I ended up rearranging all my furniture, mopping/sweeping the floor and throwing away all the built up trash and let me tell you, it was so liberating! I was listening to some good 80s music too. It&#39;s crazy how I miss this music and I didn&#39;t even grow up in that era lol.</p>\n\n<p>I felt super happy when I was done and now my room looks ten times better! I feel so much more relaxed. But anyway, I&#39;m just trying the best I can to make it in this modern society. We all are. Sometimes I just wanna escape that. And meaningful work, friendships, and music is doing for me right now. Any advice?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
