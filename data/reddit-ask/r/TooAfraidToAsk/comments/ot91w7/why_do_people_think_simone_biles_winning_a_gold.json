I don&#39;t understand the outrage at her taking care of herself instead of competing for some chunk of colorful metal that almost no one in this country has any stake in. Who the fuck cares? She&#39;s a human being, her humanity should matter more than some competition. Not to mention that she&#39;s <em>already</em> won the US several medals, she already did the thing people are mad at her for not doing now. What else do you want? She&#39;s already a world champion, why can&#39;t people leave her the fuck alone?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
