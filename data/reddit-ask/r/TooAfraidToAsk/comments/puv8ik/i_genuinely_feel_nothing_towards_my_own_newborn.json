If you feel this way please educated yourself. Don&#39;t be afraid to seek help, and talk to your partner.</p>\n\n<p>2) this feeling is in fact ok. It takes time. As long as you don&#39;t want to harm yourself, the child, or your partner, nor neglect any of the above, give it time and make the effort. Baby&#39;s are people. Meet them. Sometimes you have to learn to love them, it doesn&#39;t come natural to everyone in every scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Let me preface this by saying I in no way have any intent nor desire to harm nor neglect him in ANY way.</p>\n\n<p>My son was born Wednesday morning and we just got home from the hospital. From the time I&#39;ve seen him his mom (my girlfriend) has been wanting to hold him, see him, be around him etc. Same with all of her family. My family has been out of my life for quite some time. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been a &quot;stay at home step dad&quot; for the last year to her two older children, and whilst they apparently have an emotional attachment to me it feels like more of a job to watch them. A job I enjoy, but still a job. No emotional connection really. I look forward to the weekend when they go to their fathers like any other job feels..</p>\n\n<p>When my son was on the way I thought &quot;it will be different, he&#39;s mine&quot;. But it doesn&#39;t feel that way at all. Looking at him I feel no love. Nothing more than the feeling I have taking care of newborn animals or whatever. Is this normal for guys? Is this ok? Is it something I should seek help for? My best friend just had a kid and he&#39;s so infatuated and it&#39;s all he can think or speak of and I&#39;m just feeling like, meh. It&#39;s another person. Even in the delivery room I was more concerned with my girlfriend than the baby, I only really went to him because the social cues of the nurses.</p>\n\n<p>Edit; Update, I finally got the nerve up to speak with my girlfriend about this, using this post and everyone&#39;s comments as a &quot;helper&quot; for the conversation because trying to say the words &quot;I don&#39;t love him&quot; felt wrong. She is completely understanding. Tonight I&#39;m going to try and do skin to skin with him. She also let go of her own story, how with her middle child of the now three, she was wanting to leave the father and didn&#39;t find out she was pregnant until 7 months. She had the same feelings as me. Now he&#39;s with us 5 days a week, and recently had a health scare where she&#39;s almost in tears saying she will give him her kidney if he needs it. </p>\n\n<p>She also pointed out, with her having a c section with complications, my worry for her may be overshadowing any bonding I could have with him.</p>\n\n<p>I will be doing research into postpartum in father&#39;s, and if I feel it doesn&#39;t get any better or gets worse in any way, trust me I&#39;ll be the first one to get help. I genuinely do WANT to love the little guy in a traditional sense. And I will one day. Thank you everyone for the support and kind words.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
