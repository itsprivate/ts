A 1st class ticket might be a better option for him if it&amp;#39;s less than twice the price of a single ticket.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, if you can&amp;#39;t afford the second ticket right before lift-off then off the plane you go.  Airlines don&amp;#39;t open tabs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really big when I flew once years ago and I was so afraid this was going to happen to me, but it didn&amp;#39;t.  If it did, I would have totally agreed with being charged two tickets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
