Now things have become so one sided I just can&#39;t get motivated to have sex and when it does happen I&#39;m always thinking in the back of my mind that she&#39;s not into it - pity sex. She&#39;s like &quot;Want me to just bend over?&quot; or &quot;we can just do something quick&quot;. I guess when I was younger that didn&#39;t bug me as much, now it&#39;s killing me. I feel depressed and lost. We&#39;ve talked about it and either she doesn&#39;t get how important it is to me or she doesn&#39;t think she can change. I know she cares about the issue so it&#39;s not a lack of empathy.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess my main question is, how can guys stay relatively happy with a dead bedroom? I&#39;d appreciate answers that don&#39;t involve cheating or getting divorced.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
