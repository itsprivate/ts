I understand that there are people who enjoy pain and stuff like that but I&#39;m sure everyone has their limits, possibly?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so sorry if this is rude or anything, there is no kink shaming here or anything like that, I&#39;m just super curious. Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
