  "selftext": "I am 23 year old male. My first love was \"self imposed isolation\". It feels so much better. Since 16, I have isolated myself in my own room watching TV, video games, maladaptive Daydreaming and eating.\n\nI genuinely love isolating myself and love to eat alone. I love being abandoned and always find it bizarre when I see people cry for being lonely.\n\nWhy people cry or feel sad for being lonely? Why people crave human attention? Why people want new friends? Why people want to date, have a family and be successful or rich?\n\n\nMY GOAL IN LIFE\nMy goal in life isn't to be rich, successful or have a career. I just want a one room apartment, a normal job, eat and die alone. \n\nI don't want to get married, live with a family or have friends.\n\n\n\n\nFAMILY nd FRIENDS\nI don't need anyone to love me or crave their attention. Even on my birthday, I don't celebrate it and just love to eat alone. I never made a friend, since 2014. \n\nI avoid my school friends, when they call. I never felt lonely or depressed because of being alone. \n\n\nSEX LIFE\nI don't crave romantic partner or even have the personality or desire to have a girlfriend. \n\nI have been Daydreaming, since childhood. I create my own porn in my head and masturbate.\nFor me, \"masturbation is much better, than sex\". \n\nSo I don't need any partner. \n\n\nHUMAN CONTACT\nI engage in maladaptive Daydreaming and create characters in my head just to maintain my social skills.\n\nI have a girlfriend, mother, father and own a company. I talk to them and play their roles.\n\nIt helped me in real life, to atleast communicate or survive by communication.",
