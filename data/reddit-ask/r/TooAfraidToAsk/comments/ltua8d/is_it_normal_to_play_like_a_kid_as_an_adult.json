Ill grab a pellet gun and walk around pretending to be a sniper, envisioning and acting out finding a spot, setting up, waiting, talking with my \"spotter\". Eventually ill take my shot and move on. Sometimes ill grab a wooden walking stick and imagine myself as a witch/wizard going on adventures. Or act out my own versions of shows I like, Money heist is a good one. \n\nA scene can last for days or weeks. Itll have the same characters, running plots, all kinds of stuff. Whenever i get a chance to not be around people I just pick up wherever I left off. Im embarrassed about it, but if I dont get the chance to for a day or two it has a noticable effect on making me stressed and tense. Theres often times where im talking to someone and thinking basically \"I want to leave so that I can get back to my world\".\n\nIm sure I take it too far, but is it normal to still desire to play like that when youre an adult? Like do other adults feel it too and just mutually supress it all the time to be \"mature\"?",
