And shes super obsessive over everything and controlling even though we aren&#39;t dating. I talked to her about her actions and I told her they were creepy which she said they weren&#39;t. Some of these actions include screenshotting my parents instagram stories (whenever I am in one of the stories), she somehow has a picture of my closet with my clothes (she has never been to my house), etc. I feel as if because she is younger than me and a female and I am a male, most people will view this as fine. But if the roles were reversed and I was doing this I think I would likely be classified as a pedophile/perv. Do you guys think her behavior is creepy/obsessive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
