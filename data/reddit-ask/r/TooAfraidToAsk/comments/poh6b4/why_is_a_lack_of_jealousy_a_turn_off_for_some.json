It&#39;s like not viewing a girlfriend as properity is a bad thing. Not being overprotective is a bad thing. Understanding your girlfriend has a social life outside of you is a bad thing etc. Apparently me not feeling jealous when my gf talks to another man means I don&#39;t care about her. Me not feeling jealous when she brings up ex&#39;s means I don&#39;t care about her etc. </p>\n\n<p>Why would you want your bf to get jealous? Why is it a desirable trait?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
