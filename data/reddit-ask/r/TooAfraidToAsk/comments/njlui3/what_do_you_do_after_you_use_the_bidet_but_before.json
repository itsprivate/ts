Surely you don’t just hose off your dirt cave and pull up your pants with a soggy ass, right? And while we’re on it, how direct is the stream? Do I have to position my ass hole so it gets a direct shot? Or is it a wide spray that just covers the whole tush? Cause it seems like you’d have a soggy crotch all together which I feel would require I bit of dry cloth to deal with. I need answers. Also, as far as home attachment bidets that fit on a toilet, what is the cleaning like? How often do I have to remove a shit covered apparatus for cleaning? Folks claim that bidets are the only way and that tp is for cavemen but when I play the process out in my head it seems like a disaster. So what gives?\n\nEdit:a typo",
