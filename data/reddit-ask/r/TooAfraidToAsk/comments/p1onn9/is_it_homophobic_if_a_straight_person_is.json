My straight sister is always saying &quot;ew&quot; whenever she sees a gay couple expressing their love for each other like kissing. I always binge-watch series and movies on Netflix and I mainly watch on the living room. Since Netflix&#39;s shows has lgbtq+ representations, there are mostly gay couples or other members from the community being represented.</p>\n\n<p>I found that whenever such romantic scenes involving those members are on the show or movie Im watching she keeps saying &quot;ew&quot;. Mostly on the kissing scenes. I always stare back at her and say &quot;wtf&quot;. These representations help me as well since im closeted lol. So now I wanna ask if my sister is homophobic? I may be overreacting since straight ppl have other preferences(?) Like yeah i get that theyre not attracted to gay relationships...But she also got me confused as she supports the lgbtq+ community as well. So im like you support it but you dont really want to see it??</p>\n\n<p>I mean no offense to anyone. I just wanna know if its considered homophobic. Like dude. theyre just kissing?! If so I think ill just stay in my closet for my whole life and just enjoy the lgbtq+ reps on Netflix lol.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I saw some comments if she acts the same to hetero couples: NO she does not. She even watches those Korean dramas that mainly have straight couples. I see and hear her squeak or swoon over the main couples&#39; romantic scenes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
