I&#39;ve never in my life understood why adults act condescending towards children and don&#39;t see how that is simply not the way to go about things. I mean, don&#39;t they remember what&#39;s like being a child? I witness this far too many times, like how older relatives talk to younger relatives (and I&#39;m talking about pre-teens here) as if they are stupid. Using that voice that you use to talking to pets, not treating them as equals in a conversation, constant interruptions, not taking their ideas seriously... the list goes on. Later they&#39;re left wondering why the kids don&#39;t like interacting with them.</p>\n\n<p>Man, I remember DESPISING that behavior from grownups as a kid. It just made me hate them, so I&#39;ve always been confused when people do that and act as if it won&#39;t have any negative consequences. To be frank, I don&#39;t like kids that much but I&#39;m usually a kid magnet at social events and I&#39;ve noticed that it might be because I treat them like I treat any other person and they seem to respect and like me way more than they do with other adults. So if you&#39;re trying to interact positively with a kid (or your own) why not treat them like humans, no better or worse than yourself? It&#39;s not rocket science, <strong>kids see RIGHT through your bullshit, just saying.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
