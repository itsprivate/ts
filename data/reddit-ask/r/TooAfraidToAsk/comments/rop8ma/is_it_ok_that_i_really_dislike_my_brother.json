  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother is 13 and autistic. I usually avoid saying that because he and my mom use it as a scape goat for his behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is actually a manipulative spoilt brat and I cannot stand being around him. I came home for the Christmas holidays and ended up staying because I landed temp work nearby and I fucking hate being here. My brother manipulates us by saying he wants to kill himself whenever anything minor happens. He screams kicks and shouts when he doesn&amp;#39;t get what he wants and if I have any opinion of him other than pleasent then I get in major trouble. At 13 my mom would smack me for swearing or playing M rated games but my brother swears to her face and played R rated games as he pleases. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we bought everyone a chocolate thickshake because it&amp;#39;s so hot and when the straw was jammed he screamed and cried that he wanted kill himself and then threw away the entire thickshake. He screamed at mom that he &amp;#39;fucking hates his life&amp;#39; due to the straw being jammed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of everyone using mental health as a scape goat for him. If I even show I have any form of depression and anxiety my mom tells me to grow up (despite being depressed and anxious herself). I am routinely used as the &amp;#39;bag guy&amp;#39; complex. &amp;#39;oh it&amp;#39;s all OPs fault&amp;#39; all because of my brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I genuinely dislike him as a person but I&amp;#39;m scared to tell anyone that because he is just a kid. If he continues this behaviour I&amp;#39;m definitely never going to interact with him as an adult. He is a spoilt, disgusting, manipulative, narcissistic young teenager and I cant stand being around him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to post on &lt;a href=\"/r/AmITheAsshole\"&gt;r/AmITheAsshole&lt;/a&gt; but I feel like I might get a response from here. I really hate living at home for this temp work and I miss my apartment in the city&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
