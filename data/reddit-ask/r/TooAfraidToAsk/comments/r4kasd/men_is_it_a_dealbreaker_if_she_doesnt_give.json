I would always try with past partners because they seemed to be into it but it always really turned me off bc I had to try so hard not to throw up and I would often gag and have actually thrown up on penises before, [GROSS WARNING] but they never noticed cuz when there’s something blocking it just goes back in where it came from, fucking nasty stuff. Totally ruins the whole experience for me, but every guy seems to want blow jobs. Am I SOL?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
