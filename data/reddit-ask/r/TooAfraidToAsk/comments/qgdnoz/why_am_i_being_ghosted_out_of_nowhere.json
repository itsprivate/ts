We had great chemistry, hit it off really well. Ended up both being cheesy little basterds with each other after the party was over with a (not so) little making out session here and there. Everything was great, I noticed her looking at me when she thought I didn&#39;t see, and post-party we went into the city to find a afterparty. We didn&#39;t succeed, so I dropped her at a busstation, me kissed a bunch and she went her merry way home. We did agree on seeing each other from drinks some other time right then.</p>\n\n<p>She texted me after she got home, and the next day she continued the texting (she sent the first message that morning). I told her I wasn&#39;t fully done making out with her yesterday evening, to which she replied &quot;hehehe, yeah neither was I but it adds to the excitement doesn&#39;t it? ðŸ˜‰&quot; which I agreed with. After like 6 messages from her side and 6 from mine I asked her if she wanted to meet up for drinks later this week. No reply, I waited for 48 hours to get one. I then sent &quot;Hey, at least I thought it was great meeting you. If you don&#39;t want to continue that&#39;s fine, but message me if you do ðŸ˜™&quot;  and she hasn&#39;t responded to that either (7 hours ago).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why the sudden shift from girlfriend experience to absolute nothingness? I&#39;m pretty sure her phone hasn&#39;t fallen in the toilet or something as I did see her &#39;online&#39; on WhatsApp. Also, I suppose passive aggressive ignoring someone can be part of a gf-experience but that&#39;s not the part I&#39;m looking for.  Please help me with your thoughts, I&#39;m kind of sad that this isn&#39;t going anywhere. I did decide for myself not the send anything else before she replies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
