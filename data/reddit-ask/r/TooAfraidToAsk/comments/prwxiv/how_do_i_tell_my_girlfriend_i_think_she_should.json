I never minded but now it&#39;s to the point where she gets winded when walking up a flight of stairs. Also, it&#39;s honestly starting to effect my attraction to her. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love her to death but I seriously think it would be better for the both of us if she lost a few pounds</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I have no interest in your opinion of me or my relationship. If you&#39;re here to call me shallow to to say &quot;just dump her&quot;, please just find another post to comment on. On the other hand, thank you to everyone who gave me great advice and even better things to think about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
