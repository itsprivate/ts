Then there&#39;s having a social life, having meaningful contact and spending time with friends and family, trying to make new connections, attending birthdays, weddings and baby showers. And then there&#39;s doing your own stuff - hobbies, keeping fit, personal development.. I&#39;ve been trying to complete a course for the last 5 months but I&#39;ve barely worked on it for the last 3 because I just can&#39;t seem to find the time! </p>\n\n<p>I constantly feel anxious and disappointed with myself, the house is almost always a mess, weeks can go by without seeing family members, I feel like I miss out on important things that are happening with my friends and I always seem to be running around but not getting anywhere! It feels like everyone else has it together and is on top of it in a way that I just don&#39;t understand how to be so.. what&#39;s the secret? Or does everyone else feel like they&#39;re just scraping by too?</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; I feel like there&#39;s not enough time in life to keep on top of everything, does everyone else feel that way?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
