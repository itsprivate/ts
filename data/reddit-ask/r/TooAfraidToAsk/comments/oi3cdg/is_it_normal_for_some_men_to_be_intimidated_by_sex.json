Moved in together in 2005 and married in 2010, going strong... my problem is I feel a little intimidated by sex because she can get very sexually aggressive. It was one of the things I loved early on but as the years have gone by she has become very aggressive, wants it all the time and is obsessed with viewing porn while we go at it. She literally is after me every night and at least once in the afternoon and if it doesn&#39;t happen in the morning she gets grumpy. Don&#39;t even get me started on the lockdown... Most of 2020-2021 locked in a house everyday with this woman, never knowing when she&#39;s just gonna be like &quot;Take Me Now.&quot; It&#39;s been very intimidating. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like our culture drives men to just be assertive when trying to date/have sex and forces men to become kind of piggish and aggressive and the fact that I&#39;m intimidated now makes me feel like I&#39;m somehow less of a man. But Jesus, I&#39;m not a machine and there&#39;s so much pressure to be &quot;on&quot; all the time. Any other men ever get intimidated?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
