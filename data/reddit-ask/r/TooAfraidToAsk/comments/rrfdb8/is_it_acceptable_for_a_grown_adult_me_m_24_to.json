Fake cries randomly or tries to act cute to get attention, screams at and says horrible things to his mother (dad left because of you), takes his little brothers toys and doesn&amp;#39;t share his, and worst of all coughed in my face yesterday on purpose after he started getting sick. When my wife and I were trying to sleep he kept bursting into our bedroom and then banging on our door after we barricaded it. Spoiled Spiderman for me after he saw it, demands I make him food whenever he wants and throws a tantrum because I don&amp;#39;t. Whenever I try to reason with him explaining his behavior is in appropriate he walks away or just says the same two lame jokes nonstop. This kid fucking sucks. And I know it&amp;#39;s partially on his mother for not disciplining him but God damn, I fucking hate this kid. For context I just met him this week as my wife and I only recently got married. Is it normal to be this angry at some kid or do I have issues?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
