It’s not like I’m angry about, def a little downtrodden but not like angry at her or the world. I got rejected again today after one of my classes which is no biggie, but one of my friends called me an incel afterward. My friends and I often make fun of eachother and do get carried away but this kind of hit a weird spot as I’m really insecure about it. If I am unattractive n incapable of conversation does that make me an incel?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
