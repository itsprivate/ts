I also have social anxiety and little to no self-esteem and few other flaws which make me not a viable dating option. I desperately want to have sex but I cant have it now. In short I am an incel.</p>\n\n<p>One of my sexual fantasy is to lose my virginity to a very attractive woman but its is impossible for me to get in a relationship with average woman so getting with a very attractive woman is out of the thought and that&#39;s why I am planning on hiring a sex worker.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that I moved to this city 4 years ago from my hometown for higher education. I dont have any friends and never really had friends, I was the social outcast at the school, church, neighbourhood, among the sibilings but back there I at least had my parents so it was kinda okay. Now since I moved here I am very lonely and the only time I interact with people is at the university and that too with professors sometimes or if I go to the store to get something.</p>\n\n<p>So will be weird or creepy if I ask her to first go on a date with me and act as if she is my girlfriend because I look like a creep but dont want to come off as one. I want this because as I said I have been a social outcast and been bullied throughout my life and for once I want to be feel wanted and to feel that a woman loves to be with me even if she is pretending and it is temporary and I am going to pay her for it but its atleast better than nothing which I have right now. I know I am down bad and I shouldnt be doing this and instead go and find a girlfriend but I cant its just impossible for me.</p>\n\n<p>I work as a part time free-lancer recently made some extra money then usual so even if she charges extra it wont be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: For now I have dropped this plan after reading your comments. I am gonna take the advice some of you have given me of therapy. I have never done therapy so I have no idea how this works.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
