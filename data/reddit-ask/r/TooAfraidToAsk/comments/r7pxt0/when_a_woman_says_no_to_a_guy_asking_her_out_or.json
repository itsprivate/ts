I (F26) have had guys ask me out or ask about a relationship, and when I tell them straight forward it wouldn’t work out or I’m not interested, they’ll usually ask another handful of times or whatever until they truly understand that it’s a no. I’ll even explain why it wouldn’t work (my standards are ABC in a relationship, and from your lifestyle choices I know we wouldn’t match), but still I’ll get questions. I’m just legitimately trying to understand a guy’s thought process in all of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
