What happens to the semen while having an orgasm? How does it feel and how does it work exactly? Do you still feel the same as before making the surgery? Does it feel weird or even painful in any way? Do you still release the same amount of testosterone when doing it? I&amp;#39;m really curious to hear what is your experience with this. I don&amp;#39;t plan to do it though but I still want to know what it&amp;#39;s like. Excuse my ignorance and sorry if I did a dumb question. I don&amp;#39;t want to offend anyone. Thanks for reading this post and taking your time. Have a nice one, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Also, does it affect your daily normal life in anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Sorry for my English.
