  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman I&amp;#39;m friends with, and have been helping recently with her career progression, went away to go see her parents earlier this week as they were ill. Her husband contacted me the day she left, saying that she left some paperwork for me to look over at her house and I should come collect it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;d been to their house several times before, I thought nothing of it and went to collect it this weekend. When I got there, her husband was there and had a whole meal prepared for me, and I joked I just came for papers, not lunch, but he insisted I eat and stay so I gave in and said sure. Then he asked me if I wanted tea or coffee and I said I wanted strong coffee if he had any. He brought out the coffee, spiked with alcohol, and I called him out and he insisted there was no alcohol, it was almond flavouring. And he also brought out some wine and poured me a glass, and I said I really shouldn&amp;#39;t but he insisted and I started feeling awkward and took it and had one sip but something felt off. He then came and sat next to me and moved in to grab me and kiss me; I pushed him off, and he said sorry &amp;quot;I was feeling faint&amp;quot;, which was total BS. And then he tried it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I left, crying, forgetting that paperwork, which I later found out didn&amp;#39;t exist. And I feel so awful about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I tell my friend, that her husband, didn&amp;#39;t even wait 2 days for her to be out of town, before making a pass at me? I don&amp;#39;t want to wreck their marriage by telling her, but I also wouldn&amp;#39;t want a guy like that trapping another woman like this so am really conflicted about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
