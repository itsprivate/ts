It’s not a secret, and my new boyfriend thinks it’s “extremely weird” to be that close with a sibling. He’s “uncomfortable” with it. I think it’s gross that my BF is acting jealous of my relationship with my brother. However, we’ve spoken to some friends and gotten mixed reactions ranging from “wtf” to “must be a twin thing” to “doesn’t seem that weird”.</p>\n\n<p>So, I want the opinion of unbiased strangers. Is it that weird that we cuddle?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’ve been told in PMs to include the following. We don’t generally “spoon” unless we fall asleep cuddling and happen to wake up that way. Our other brothers never mentioned it being weird growing up. Our parents were taken out of the picture when we were very young so we never had their input on the subject either way; the person who raised us never said anything, though.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: a word for privacy</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: yes, we are American</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
