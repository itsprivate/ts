If I said to my friends on the track team &quot;hey let&#39;s touch that guys balls&quot; they&#39;d call me super gay and probably not talk to me for a while. (We live in a cornfield so everyone&#39;s pretty conservative.) Like in no way would anyone in my grade would ever consciously grab another dudes bare balls even for a prank. Hazing is one thing sure, but that&#39;s just straight up gay!</p>\n\n<p>So why do they do stuff like that?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
