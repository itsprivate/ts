Usually that just involves pinning me with a firm grip on my limbs to a wall/bed so I have to listen to him. His grip is painful but not really hard enough to leave a bruise. I think I’ve only been bruised twice (in these six years) and the one outlier occasion was when he tried to throw me onto the bed a few years ago and grip my throat and throttle me to stop me from speaking. But he apologised immediately and stopped himself because he recognised that was too much. </p>\n\n<p>I know it’s clearly not ideal behaviour but is it actually not uncommon?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
