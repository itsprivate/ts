  "selftext": "This is definitely something that’s been on my mind for years now. I can say that I am less ignorant on the subject of race than I was in 2010, but, this particular set of thoughts always bother me.\n\nFor starters, I think I should say I’m a very anxious person with severe social anxiety, I live in a small (mostly white) town and I never got out much even before Covid. I don’t have much real world experience, my view of the world is largely determined by what I see on the internet/TV/Media.\n\nUp until all the wokeness stuff started, I never thought about my race at all. I just thought of myself as a person. When thinking about other races, I thought the same thing of other races, “Oh, this person just happens to be this color”. \n\nAnd yes I will admit, there are some very racist people where I live. I can admit I’ve had biases and some ignorance when it comes to race, but I don’t associate with these people, as I said, I’m basically a hermit. Though of course, my environment surely has had some kind of impact on me in ways I may not realize. Though I think anyone could say the same.\n\nNow, this particular subject, I’ve brought up before to people in the past, but it’s always dismissed. And that’s exactly what I see as part of a problem. Everyone is (seemingly) so dismissive of white people in general, and their opinions on race... but are told that they need to listen to other races and not be dismissive of them. It just seems so hypocritical and backwards to me.\n\nNow let me say I believe racism is a problem. Black people and other POC do face discrimination daily.  And I’ll probably never completely understand what it’s like to be black in the US. I think there’s work to be done when it comes to racial equality.\n\nWith that being said, I can’t help but feel like I’m being thrown in to some oppressor role for simply being white. White people in general seem to be treated like a monolith, all the while being told not to treat other races like a monolith. \n\nLike me not being able to comprehend being an average black person, I don’t think poc quite understand what it’s like to be an average white person. I’m white, and I can’t help but feel attacked for being white. But if I say anything about it, I’m more or less told to just get over it. \n\nIf you do a google search, anything you find about white people is always negative. White people are terrible. White people need to do x or y. White people are the problem. White opinions don’t matter. Abolish whiteness. I mean... what a bunch of freakin horrible things to say about the same people that they say need to support them. They say white people need to help with the goals of ending racism also while saying they can’t have an opinion or talk about race. How am I not supposed to take stuff like that personally? It just seems very self centered and one sided... and well, kinda racist.\n\nBut then I’m told “Stop making this about you”. And that’s that. \n\n“You need to do what we say or you’re racist/evil/part of the problem, end of story.” Or at least it definitely comes off that way.\n\nI don’t feel heard as a white person. In fact I’m usually told that I shouldn’t be. Because, I’m white, it’s not about me, etc.\n\nAnd I don’t mean “heard” from white people. I wanna be heard from other races, not by some racist pro white circle jerk that’ll just make it about other races being bad. \n\nI just think it’s difficult for real conversations to happen if the respect isn’t mutual. Or if one side is silenced. And I can’t help but feel like that happens way too much. And I’m sure white people do it too. I’m sure black people have felt dismissed by white people. How can races get along if either side feels dismissed by the other? \n\nI would really like to believe that I’m receptive to what other people (particularly of other races) have to say, I like to believe that I actually listen... but man, it really sucks when it feels like it’s not a two way street.",
