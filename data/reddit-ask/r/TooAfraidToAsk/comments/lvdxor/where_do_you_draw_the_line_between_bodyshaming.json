I see a lot of people talking about how rude it is to draw attention to someone's weight, and how offensive it can be to say something like \"omg you're so skinny! Are you eating enough? Do you have an eating disorder? Are you anorexic?\" I can definitely see how comments like these would hurt someone's feelings, or at least make them feel very awkward/self-conscious, and often when people say things like this, they don't even realize how it could make the other person feel, and if confronted, they'll claim that they were only saying it because they're concerned about the person's health (which is often an excuse). \n\nHOWEVER, what if you've noticed that someone has lost a significant amount of weight in a relatively short period of time, and you are genuinely worried about them? How do you approach this without offending them? Especially if you suspect that they might have an eating disorder? Honestly, I'd rather express concern to a skinny person who doesn't actually have an eating disorder and accidentally offend them rather than not reach out to someone who DOES have an eating disorder because I'm too afraid to say something. Eating disorders can be dangerous and even deadly. I'd rather hurt someone's feelings than let someone die because I didn't intervene. \n\nI apologize in advance because i know this might be a very controversial topic, but I think it needs to be discussed. To be clear I am in NO WAY condoning body-shaming or any kind of shaming for that matter. Also, I know that some people might say \"you shouldn't bring it up unless they do first\" and my counter argument to that would be that when someone is suffering from an eating disorder, they often don't see themselves or their situation clearly, so they are unlikely to even recognize that there is a problem, let alone reach out and ask for help.\n\nEdit: So basically, I'm not asking whether or not it should be brought up. I think it should be brought up. So rather, I'm asking HOW it should be brought up-- in the healthiest, most constructive, non-offensive way possible?",
