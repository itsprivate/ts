If I'm playing with my dog and I lie down next to him, I'm not moving for 20 minutes. There's just something about lying on your back on the floor that gets me weirdly relaxed..",

And I find it to be weird enough that I never do it unless I&#39;m home alone. It&#39;s sort of a habit for me. It also doesn&#39;t really matter if I&#39;m on my back, side or stomach, it&#39;s equally relaxing.. Should I buy a slab of marble and throw out my bed? Nah but seriously, am I alone in this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
