The world is not efficiently built for taller people so I naturally am looking at an angle downwards to see what in doing. Issue is any average height breasted person in my town has there chest inconveniently located right where my resting point of my eyes are. I make immediate corrections when I see the chest appear in my focal point but always feel awkward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one with this issue? Should I still go to my family gatherings? Shall I notify my close friends and family it&amp;#39;s an accidental reoccurring occurrence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I haven&amp;#39;t been 6 ft 4 for a long time now, just got a rapid growth spurt and grew 6 inches. Wasn&amp;#39;t an issue before but now it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: should mention I&amp;#39;m gay this is purely an awkward scenario I keep finding myself in. Not some gross perv way of living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
