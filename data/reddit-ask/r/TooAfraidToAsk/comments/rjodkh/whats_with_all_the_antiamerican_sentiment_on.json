A lot of the top comments under this post basically say “Americans never let ambulances and firetrucks through.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived in America for a while and whenever I saw an emergency vehicle, cars made way for it. To confirm, I made a post on the ‘ask an American’ subreddit asking if people make room for emergency services vehicles. All the replies confirmed that they do, stated that it’s law to do so, and reiterated that it’s basically universally followed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is one example of this anti-American bias I’ve noticed on Reddit (another is that when the vaccine was just coming out, Canada announced that it would be free to all citizens and the news articles announcing this were on the front page for a while. The US announced that they would be free before Canada did and this did not make it onto the front page). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many other examples I could list. Why does this anti-American sentiment exist on Reddit?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
