I was wondering what people experience in day to day life if you’re unattractive/ugly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never thought much about it until recently one of my friends pointed out how people treat him vs me. Now I can’t stop noticing how dismissive they are of him, and how hard he has to work to get people to like him. And my friend is one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. Frankly, it makes me sad how superficial people are as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, sorry if this offends anyone. It’s probably a stupid question anyway&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
