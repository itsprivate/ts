  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I started my first job at a major drug store three months ago. With the holidays being extremely busy for us I’ve had more hours than I normally would, and I would be asked a few times a week to come in extra days when someone else calls out or they need extra help. I actually volunteered to stay an extra hour while working the night shift when someone else went home sick (not Covid related). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last month has been extremely overwhelming for me, as on top of an extremely busy work I just got through finals for college. Now that college is over, they are starting to give me many more hours than I would normally work, even scheduling me on the day I said I couldn’t work when I had classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to being really busy, I’ve been asked to come in a lot more on days I’m not scheduled for. I last worked Monday morning (my first opening shift as I usually work nights) and I was asked by the manager to work Tuesday from 7AM-3PM. I said yes out of the fear of upsetting the manager but, still feeling overwhelmed from the last few weeks and really looking forward to the three days off I was supposed to have this week, I asked a few minutes later if I could give that shift a pass, and she seemed pretty upset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time I’ve turned down a request to come in when I wasn’t scheduled. I said no when I was asked to work on a day I had a final, and the day after I got my booster when I wasn’t feeling well the morning after, and also said no when I was asked to work an extra hour on Christmas even and the day after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m worried that saying no too often to coming in on days I’m not scheduled for might make me look bad to my mangers and I feel like I’m letting them down when they need me. They have been extremely flexible with my schedule so I also feel really bad. Should I start saying yes more often and should I be feeling bad about this? I’d love to hear some different perspectives. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
