If we ALL know social media is so fake then why do we still compare ourselves to each other and get depressed over it? There&#39;s always some corporation trying to manipulate you into buying their product, or some influencer that&#39;s only ever &quot;interactive&quot; to promote their beauty line. Nothing wrong with having a job, but no one is genuine anymore. Its almost as if people prefer to be lied to and subconsciously controlled rather than make the most of their reality past the screen. And the crazy thing is that we ALL have known this for the longest time. It&#39;s like everyone I meet has gotten really bitter and sensitive somehow and I can&#39;t be the only one who&#39;s noticed that everyone seems really out of touch with each other nowadays. People die everyday because of something stupid online! I mean, it&#39;s fine to enjoy the internet but it&#39;s just scary how seemingly numb we&#39;ve all become to its manipulation. Am I just crazy or does anyone else feel like this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
