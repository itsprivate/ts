I&#39;ve tried many time to tell my parents, but they say  due to his autism he doesn&#39;t know better. They don&#39;t believe what he&#39;s  doing even when all of my other siblings have seen him do it and told my parents also. They won&#39;t acknowledge what he&#39;s doing,  and I&#39;m worried for what he may do. They also say that me being the oldest and him going through puberty he&#39;s just interested in girls and its normal. I do not feel like what he&#39;s doing is normal yet, they won&#39;t listen. Am I just being overdramatic and is this normal for for him due to his autism?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
