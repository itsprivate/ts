He said he had been having mild symptoms and I had seen him up cooking and doing dishes. He pushed our trash to the end of the driveway yesterday morning, but later that evening his Facebook said he hadn’t been active in 10 hours and the house just felt awfully quiet. My brain told me he might be dead... but I brushed it off as he had probably been laid up because of the virus. This morning we checked on him and he was sitting in the living room dead. I feel awful that I didn’t check yesterday because I figured it was nothing and he was just resting up. We just went about our entire day while he was probably laying down there dead.... My house feels scary and empty now and my friend is dead. I have never experienced worrying that someone might be dead and then it turns out they are actually dead... I feel so awful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
