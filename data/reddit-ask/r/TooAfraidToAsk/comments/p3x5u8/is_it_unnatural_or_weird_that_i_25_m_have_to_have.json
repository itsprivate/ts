I just told her that I don’t want to move too fast, but really I just had no desire to have sex because I didn’t feel like we had a strong enough connection. </p>\n\n<p>Looking back I’ve realized that most times I’ve had sex have been because i was either in a relationship/had known the girl for a long time, or because she came on to me. Once I get into the act I usually become interested, but that would require some serious advances on the lady’s part to get to that point (which I’m sure you understand is a rarity). I feel like all of the men I’ve ever met just like having sex for the fun of it, so it worries me that I might just be a very abnormal individual.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
