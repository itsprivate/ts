He will then turn to my husband and say things like &amp;quot;Sorry, I tried to help you out but she won&amp;#39;t go for it&amp;quot;. This man is not my husband&amp;#39;s father, just a guy his mom married who happens to only be about 8 years older than myself. Him and my husband don&amp;#39;t really talk and my husband just tells me to ignore it. When he makes these suggestions I tell him I like myself the way I am and am not a fan of fake anything. He laughs it off and drops it but I can help feel gross when I have to interact with him now during holidays and whatnot. He also tries to initiate conversations with me almost daily through text or phone calls despite the fact I don&amp;#39;t reply. This is a super inappropriate thing to talk about with your daughter-in-law and I&amp;#39;m not really sure why he is so focused on it. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
