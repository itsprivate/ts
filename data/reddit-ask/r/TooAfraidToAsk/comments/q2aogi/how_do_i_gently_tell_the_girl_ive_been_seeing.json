I feel like we match in a lot of ways (same sense of humor, similar interests, same college courses, etc), but she has an odor issue I can’t seem to get over. She came over today and after cuddling for a bit we made out for the first time, and I couldn’t get over how bad she smelled. She had some pretty bad breath and genuinely didn’t smell good (closest thing I can compare it to is the weird musty smell of my grandparents house). I have no idea of what to do here because I genuinely like her but was instantly put off the second I went to kiss her. I didn’t say anything at the time, but it’s not something I’m looking forwards to doing again. I don’t want it to seem like I have some obnoxiously high standard for personal hygiene, but from my point of view it doesn’t seem like she is putting in the baseline effort. Any thoughts on how I should approach it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
