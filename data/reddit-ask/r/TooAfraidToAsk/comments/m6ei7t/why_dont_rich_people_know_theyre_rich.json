  "selftext": "This has been on my mind lately because I've recently started dating a girl whose family is significantly wealthy (at least from my perspective).\n\nShe grew up in the Connecticut suburbs. Her family's money is old. It comes from the heyday of NYC advertising. She and her siblings attended separate private boarding schools growing up, and they pay for everything with their own cards attached to their parent's accounts. Their private college is paid for in full as well.\n\nI myself am from a working class background. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and I am the first and only person so far in my family to attend college. I grew up living in trailer courts and eventually, a modest 3 bd 1 bath house. \n\nMy gf and I have been together for about 4 months, and she has been consistently tight-lipped (as most wealthy people are) regarding her family's lifestyle and exactly how much money they have. But I'm very observant and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out when someone is heavily privileged compared to yourself.\n\nThis weekend, I had the pleasure of traveling with my gf to Connecticut to meet her parents for the first time. Let me just say: Holy shit. I was right. \n\nHer family is clearly wealthy. I mean, they don't own private jets or anything, but the house is a massive 6 bedroom, 6 bathroom place located on a huge piece of property with an incredibly nice courtyard, pool area, etc.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to this visit, I was a nervous wreck about how a poor kid like me might come off to them. They aren't snobby people or anything, but I was really nervouse because of the class difference, and I vaguely told my gf this a few times before we went up.\n\nWhen we got there, I must've looked like a deer in the headlights. The place was easily the most gorgeous home I've ever been in. I was blown away.\n\nShortly after we arrived and we had a minute to ourselves, my gf came up to me, gave me a kiss and a hug and said, sincere as could be:\n\n\"See? I told you were worried for nothing. My family isn't even rich, as you can clearly see.\"\n\nSo my question is....how and why are rich people so out of touch about how rich they really are???",
