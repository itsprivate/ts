We live in a place where white people are by far the minority. People here really don’t like white people to the point that we have wondered if my boyfriend should instead take my last name when we get married to avoid discrimination for our kids. I’ve even heard my bosses say they won’t hire a white person before. </p>\n\n<p>Last night while he was working, a POC came in and ignored my boyfriend to his face while he was trying to help him in the store he works. He told his son in front my boyfriend that he “don’t speak to white boys” and that “white boys can go shut the hell up.” Then somehow continued to ignore him for the rest of the transaction. </p>\n\n<p>It made my blood boil to hear my boyfriend was treated like this, but everyone says white racism isn’t real. We see things like this happen all the time where I’ll get treated better than my boyfriend. Why is it that when something clear as this happens is it not considered racism because he’s white? </p>\n\n<p>Sorry Im seriously not trying to stir the shit pot on this, I’m genuinely confused and questioning. Please educate me if I’m misunderstanding.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
