The problem is it takes too damn long. Going to the store, buying all the ingredients, cooking everything up at home, then of course washing all the pots, pans and dishes... All for just 15-20 minutes of eating. </p>\n\n<p>So instead I make relatively healthy meals that are pretty bland but easy to make. Plain rice, chicken and some vegetables sauteed in the pan. I make a big container of chicken at the start of the week and eat from it every day. Or, mashed potatoes and a can of tuna with some vegetables on the side. Again, a thing of mashed potatoes lasts several days. I really hate eating this stuff but it&#39;s all very low-effort and fulfills my nutritional needs. I don&#39;t really care about seasoning because it&#39;s also a lot of work and it doesn&#39;t really make it taste that much better.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else out there who does the same?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
