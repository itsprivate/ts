The Titanic is sinking and we're serving cucumber sandwiches and playing Vivaldi to 1st class in front of the lifeboats we don't get to use, WHY is this OK",

Why do we serve them their meals and drive their cars and clean their laundry? I have a fantasy where every POS rich person who got what they got through human suffering and exploitation is just...ignored. </p>\n\n<p>Seriousky, try it. Pick your least favorite corrupt politician or out-of-touch space-fucking billionaire and play a scene in your mind where they wake up and no one acknowledges them.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine their pissy little hissy fits when they demand their breakfast or clothes for the day or whatever only to be met by total silence and an indifferent, formerly-loyal workforce. Imagine their pathetic little scrunched up face getting redder and redder when they realize that they&#39;ve lost it, it&#39;s gone...they can&#39;t coerce or bribe or threaten people to do their bidding anymore. They have to fucking cooperate if they want to live.</p>\n\n<p>I know there will ALWAYS be indoctrinated dipshits who froam at the mouth in a frenzy to serve the predator class, but WHY? Why, after all the mounting evidence that billionaires and the &quot;elite&quot; are essentially parasites who make the world objectively worse through the working conditions they create and the environmental abuses they perpetuate, why do we KEEP WORKING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES COMFORTABLE WHILE THEY LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR DEATHS?</p>\n\n<p>The ultra-rich are acting like the global climate catastrophe doesn&#39;t matter because to them it doesn&#39;t, their money will insulate them no matter how bad things get. Well, I fucking wish we could change that. Oh no, Jess Bezo&#39;s hydroponic farm in his secret New Zealand apocalypse island needs someone to maintain it? Get fucked Jeff, no self-sustaining food source unless you put the work in and do it yourself or else learn how to cooperate with the rest of humanity. </p>\n\n<p>Seriously, can we all just keep doing what we&#39;re doing and start working towards a healthier planet and society, while actively ignoring ultra-rich parasites in the process? We don&#39;t need a guillotine, all we need to do us stop serving these fucks until they realize what the &quot;we&#39;re in this together&quot; message their companies and governments propagate really means.</p>\n\n<p>Whats the answer here? Why are we apparently more than okay to keep cleaning up after the shits who keep wrecking things for the rest of us? </p>\n\n<p>Oh and if you&#39;re here to defend billionaires because &quot;they help people by creating jobs&quot; or whatever fucking excuse you use to stand up for the people who would exploit you to death in a heartbeat, we are WELL past this argument. The ocean&#39;s on fire,  everything is dying, and the super-rich are still holding the match and gasoline; you piping in to say that maybe they have a good reason for doing what they&#39;re doing and we should let them play out their destruction is fucking stupid, delusional, and pathetic</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
