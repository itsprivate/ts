We are hopeful this won't catch too many other types of questions but understand that sexuality questions can sometimes get caught in our filter so don't hesitate to message us if you believe your question has nothing to do with trans/NB/pronoun stuff and we will review it for approval. \n\nIf you're here to ask a trans question, you really should try using our search bar. The recent influx of trans questions to the sub means that not only has your question likely already been answered but it also means you'll get to skip out on all the additional harassment from users who either refuse to give you the benefit of the doubt or are here to act in bad faith.\n\nThanks.",
