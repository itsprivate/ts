He accused me of making it up and I told him I’ve been with the guy for years. He then goes on how he can’t get a girlfriend because he’s 5’5, balding and overweight. I felt bad for him because people can be cruel. Then he says “at least I’m white”, which was weird. He told me what “Just be white” meant and I told him that’s stupid. He told me I was “coping” because I can’t accept facts. He proceeded to explain how people with European ancestry are more evolved than ethnic people and that ethnic people can never be as attractive. I was so confused and I walked away. I don’t get it Danny Devito managed to get a wife and he’s not conventionally attractive what’s wrong with that guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
