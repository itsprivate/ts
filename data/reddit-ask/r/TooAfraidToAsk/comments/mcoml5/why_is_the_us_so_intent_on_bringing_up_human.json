US started the Iraq War *with no evidence* and only to push their own agenda, and then they refused to join the International Criminal Court, and decided to sanction the ICC, I don't get why do they think they have the moral standpoint to denounce any other country for doing something that *they* are still doing to this very day. \n\nIt always feel to me that the United States expect every other country to fall in line with international rules and protocol - which *they themselves ignore*. \n\nI've been seeing posts with a lot of people asking why is no one speaking about the genocide happening in China, but is the answer not obvious? The world did not go into war because they oppose the holocaust, they did it because the Nazis set their sights *outside* of their own country. No country would dare go to war over a country's *internal issue*, they would meddle, certainly, all countries meddle with other countries, it's like a thing for them, but they would never really push on the agenda because let's be real - *they are not their people*.\n\nAll in all, I...don't think that the US have any right to denounce China's actions, when they themselves have willingly - and are still doing the same atrocities, not to mention the whole racism and gun issues running rampant in the US. \n\nIt's like a neighbour telling you how to parent your kids, but said neighbour's own kids are high up on drugs and guns. I feel like, if the US have managed to fixed most of their issues on this, if they have moved *past* this, and is *not in the middle of a war they started for their own agenda*, what they are saying would be more reasonable, would be something that doesn't *feel* hypocritical at all. But because US is doing the same thing as China does, it never feel like they have a leg to stand on, and they are just throwing tantrums that other nations are doing the same thing as they do. \n\nFor the record, when I say US/China, I am not referring to the people, only the government and the most vocal supporters and denouncers.",
