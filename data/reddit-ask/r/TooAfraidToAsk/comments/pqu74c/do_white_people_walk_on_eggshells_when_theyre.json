I could be wrong, but it feels like she has this underdog mentality when it comes to minorities and she feels she has to &quot;stand up for us&quot; even if that means just saying stupid shit. Nobody else in the class notices it and it is a 99.9% black school for what it&#39;s worth. I just cringe at some of the shit she says. She said she left Colorado because all of the people are &quot;white and rich&quot;. I get the rich part, but in my mind, I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Aren&#39;t you white&quot;. I would never leave my city saying everyone was &quot;black and broke&quot;. She just seems so fake woke and walks on eggshells around us and it makes me fucking cringe. Am I right about her? And do you notice other white people doing this around &quot;people of color&quot;?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
