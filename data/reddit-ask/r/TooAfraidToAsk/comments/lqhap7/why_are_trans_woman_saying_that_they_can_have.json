It even went so far where i saw posts where Trans Woman took pictures of themselves with fake blood (?) on their underwear saying they had a \"accident\" and it's hard being a Woman. I have seen posts from people demanding off time from work once a month because they need that time to feel like a real woman. I'm sorry I but this is straight up mental illness. It would be like a Trans Man can't come to work because he \"Squeezed his balls to hard\". I don't have aby problems with trans people or  or anyone. I think it's great that people can express themselves like this but this? please someone explain to me.\n\nEdit : I don't know what happened but they post duplicate itself??? i fixed it now but that was weird",
