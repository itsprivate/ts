I feel like crap on those days. </p>\n\n<p>However, I have a lot of friends and any time sleep habits come up, it seems like almost everyone sleeps less than 7 hours a night. My co worker claims he only gets 4 hours a night. I’ve never met anyone like me who insists they need 8 hours or feel bad the next day. Is it all in my head? </p>\n\n<p>I do work a job that requires a lot of manual labor and also go to the gym 5 days a week, so maybe my body requires more sleep?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
