  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wish you guys gave a shit about things that actually matter instead of coming online and, instead of assuming people are being legitimate in a sub called <strong>TOO AFRAID TO ASK</strong>, you&#39;re too busy &quot;sleuthing&quot; their post history and demanding to know why we let people farm karma here, allow questions that are google-able etc etc.</p>\n\n<p>If someone were farming karma, don’t you think we have better metrics and bots providing us data than your 20 minutes (lol nice use of time) to scour some random OPs post history? If someone is karma farming here, it’ll come out in the wash. Regardless you should always either assume someone is asking genuinely and try to answer or assume they’re not answering genuinely and IGNORE THE POST. The part where you get involved to post something nasty is when I have to get involved and let me tell you, I HATE getting involved over NOTHING.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that reading the rules prior to posting is a requirement in just about every sub on this website, from now on any user that draws attention to the fact that they&#39;ve not read our rules and engages in belittling an OP for asking a &quot;google-able&quot; question will receive a 3 day ban with a lovely reminder and link to our rules and sidebar. Belittling an OP because you think they have asked a question you deem dumb will also receive a 3 day ban.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to also take this moment to remind you that this sub utilizes strikes against accounts, repeat offenders will be permanently banned.</p>\n\n<p>No one among the mod team cares if the OP posts regularly on karma-farming subs, no one among the mod team makes assumptions regarding the circumstances a question has been asked. IF the question <em>appears genuine</em>, IF the OP is attempting to engage with people trying to educate / discuss with them, then this is the place for it. Google does not always generate discussion, and people looking up answers to things does not always lead them to a fully correct answer. Admittedly, there are many reasons why someone would not be capable of correctly googling something or leading themselves to the correct answer. Some people may just want to have a discussion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Regardless of the robust-ness of the question, you have <strong>no right</strong> in this sub to belittle someone for asking. We&#39;re coming down hard for it now. This serves as a sub-wide warning. No one among the mod team cares if you stopped to read it before posting your vitriol online.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
