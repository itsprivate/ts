She was hot af and didn’t at all feel like I was settling, and her titties were in my face the whole time which was also hot. The sex felt great and I felt close at times but it never happened for me while she was able to get quite wet. She suggested it may be because it was too cold outside as we did this in the forest of a college campus due to lack of options. Still I’m just wondering what was up with that, I’m just at least happy it was good for her and I of course loved it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
