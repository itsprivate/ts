As time  goes by I noticed my family and friends are starting to get concerned  that I am single. My family keeps asking when I will have a girlfriend.  If they see a photo of me with one of my woman friends the first thing  they ask is if she is single. Friends do the same, one of them even  claimed I must be suffering from some sort of unacknowledged trauma if I  am not interested in dating.  </p>\n\n<p>Are they right? I am straight and do find women attractive, but I have  zero interest in dating or being in a relationship. It just seems like  so much work for little pay off. I haven&#39;t had any traumatic sexual or romantic experiences either. There are many things I rather do with  my time like hang out with friends or go to the movies or play games  than waste a day with some stranger pretending to woo her. It doesn&#39;t  appeal to me to waste my time like that after a long week of work. Am I  the weird one here?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
