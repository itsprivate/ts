From my experience as an Asian in NYC, I have only ever experienced racism from black people. My family and friends have also had this experience. Now this may be anecdotal, but I wanted to know why I&#39;ve never had this experience with white people. I would imagine there would be solidarity with people of color but unfortunately that has never been my experience.</p>\n\n<p>Again anecdotal, but I feel like Asian hate in NYC are all perpetuated by black. Maybe it&#39;s the news idk. But I can for a fact say I&#39;ve never been called a chink by a white person. I&#39;ve never been called ching chong by a white person. I don&#39;t understand.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I want to say thank you everyone for your input. I can only hope we continue to ask questions and understand each other so that we can be empathetic towards each other. I hope one day racism disappears.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
