If we’re in the car and there’s a boy ages 12-16 going about his day, he’ll yell, “get your hands off my daughter”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) I got in trouble for HAVING BREASTS, then he inspected them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) he is obsessed with me remaining a child. He demands for me to be a little kid again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) When I was 8 and in the bathroom naked, he sprayed my vaginal area with silly string. He denies that he did it, but I’m not making it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13) “Accidentally” going into my room without knocking when I’m naked on the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14) Encourages me to lose weight to be &amp;lt;100 pounds, makes me step on the scale almost every time I see him and he calls me fat if I’m more than 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
