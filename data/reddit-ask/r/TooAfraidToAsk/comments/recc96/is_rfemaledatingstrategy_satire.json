Are they being serious with the posts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw something posted on another sub making fun of the FDS sub and have now been there reading for a bit. I laughed pretty good at the top 2 or 3 posts, then my wife came over to see what I had been giggling at. She LOST it over a couple posts and then asked me if the women here are serious. I don&amp;#39;t know... are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I both agree that it HAS to be satire. Again, no disrespect to any of the women there who ARE taking it seriously, I wish you the best of luck... I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit/update: I just tried to make a post in the sub, you have to wait for approval so I think &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; is an understatement. Follow up question though, how is this allowed on reddit? Isn&amp;#39;t it hate speech against a specific group?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
