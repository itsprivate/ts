  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My girlfriend and I (both 20 years old) have been dating for about 6 months now, and I thought it was going really well. We have our differences but we both love each other a lot and want to get a place together, mostly to get away from our families for personal reasons. We don&#39;t have jobs that allow us to save up money quickly enough to get a place for ourselves as soon as we want though. Originally we talked about this and agreed we would be patient and hopefully find better paying jobs in the near future.\nWell, last night she admits to me that she had been talking to one her old school friends whom I am unfamiliar with. This friend offered her a job at the brothel she works at a few suburbs away, telling her she&#39;ll get $300 - $400 a night there, and my girlfriend starts telling me she&#39;s going to take it. She&#39;s instant that the money will be worth it, and that she feels that it will be money she is &#39;proud&#39; to earn herself. She also tells me that I shouldn&#39;t be worried because it&#39;s a legal brothel (which, to be fair, is at least better than the illegal ones in the city), that she can choose her own nights and customers, and that it&#39;ll help us out financially.\nObviously, I&#39;m quite uncomfortable and distressed by her choice, because the job literally her letting other men have sex with her. If she was single that would be different, but we&#39;ve been in a relationship together for a solid amount of time and to her it seems these two things don&#39;t connect at all, other than the money. But I would gladly wait to save up money for us rather than her getting a lot of it doing this job. In response she seemed offended I wasn&#39;t appreciative of her choice. Long story short, we had a fight, and she ended it with a nasty remark about my sexual performance, something she knows I&#39;m insecure about. So that&#39;s probably a factor too. We haven&#39;t seen each other since then, and she starts her &#39;new job&#39; in 2 days.\nIs there anything I could tell her to change her mind or dissuade her? I do still love her, but I don&#39;t know if I can stay in this relationship with her if she continues with this. Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
