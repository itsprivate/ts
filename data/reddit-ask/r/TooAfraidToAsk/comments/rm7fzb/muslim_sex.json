I come from a region where there&amp;#39;s basically not a single Muslim in sight. As I&amp;#39;ve started traveling I&amp;#39;m seeing a ton in Europe and this question just popped in my head. I&amp;#39;ve seen what I would consider to be very modern Muslim (even if wearing a hijab) and non modern (wearing full burkas). So do they have, are allowed to have, you get what I&amp;#39;m saying...extravagent sex or is it missionary in servitude of God type sex? Do they do oral, even men on women (based on their religion I would think not). Is bdsm a thing, rough sex, bathroom sex, I mean all of it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again please don&amp;#39;t come for me, it just seems to me that someone who is so religious as to make (or choose) children and women wear burkas, hijabs, etc  wouldn&amp;#39;t have sex sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
