The only way I’m able to get them to respond is if I apologize and agree. If I apologize, but still don’t want to then they continue staying silent and depressed. Once in a while they’ll act a bit angry and press me for answers followed by then sadness and silence. </p>\n\n<p>So I comply and then they feel better and tell me they love me and all that lovey stuff. It’s gotten to the point where I just want to cry and throw up afterwards. It’s also made me even more reluctant to agree or spend time with them, leading to more anger and sadness and other confusing issues with them. </p>\n\n<p>Is this still considered a form of harassment or even rape? I was told that before, but because I say, “Yes,” I’m not sure if it actually counts and that I’m just bringing this upon myself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
