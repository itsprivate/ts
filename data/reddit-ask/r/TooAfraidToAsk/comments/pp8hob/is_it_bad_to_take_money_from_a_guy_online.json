He introduced me to a group and now I’ve got like 5 of these guys? I’ve paid off my car, refurnished my entire house and going on holiday and they’ve paid for it all. </p>\n\n<p>And all they want is for me to like be annoyed at them?

Should I let them go to like a professional dominatrix or just keep going?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
