Plus her dad doesn&#39;t know I exist) And her only explanation was &quot;it&#39;s urgent&quot;.

I&#39;ve heard a lot of funny scam stories and I hope this isn&#39;t one of them... Sorry if this is long, I&#39;m just a bit naive and came here looking for opinions to see if I&#39;m not the only one that feels something strange is going on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
