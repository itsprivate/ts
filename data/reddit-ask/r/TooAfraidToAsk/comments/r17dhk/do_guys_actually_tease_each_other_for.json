Personally I’ve never actually known any people (male or female) to do this to friends. It seems mean-spirited imo, but are there people out there who actually do this? Obviously if you are treating your friends badly they may say something about how you always choose the gf or whatever, but besides that, do you actually know anyone who makes comments like “dude you are so whipped” or “woooow *snicker *snicker” ?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
