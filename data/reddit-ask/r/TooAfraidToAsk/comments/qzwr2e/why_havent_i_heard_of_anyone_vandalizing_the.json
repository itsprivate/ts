But I get the feeling I&#39;m going to end up in a government list if I ask...</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, with all the massive protests that have happened the last few years here in the US, all the rioting and vandalism (justified or not), I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t heard of, for example, someone throwing Molotov cocktails  at Jeff Bessos&#39; mansion.  Or covering the outside walls of Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s house with obscene graffiti.  Not that I condone it.  But I find it interesting that the people who were out protesting, and who are the same type of people who says things like &quot;eat the rich&quot;, are not out there blocking intersections in order to keep the super wealthy trapped  in their homes.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve known for ages that most of the issues in this country stem from wealth inequality.  But I don&#39;t see anyone protesting for that.  Or maybe they are and I just don&#39;t watch the news enough?  I don&#39;t know.  But as a fairly liberal person, but not the type to go to demonstrations, it kinda sucks to say but I&#39;m starting to think that people were only going to demonstrations because it was trendy.  I get the feeling that many of them were just doing it to get views and followers, but couldn&#39;t give a shit what, or for whom, the demonstrations were for.  That&#39;s a very depressing thought.</p>\n\n<p>Because if that&#39;s the case, if most people  are pursuing activism mostly for social media brownie points, then why even bother to care about the state of our society?  because if the people that supposedly care enough to do something about it aren&#39;t doing anything that doesn&#39;t fit their individual goals, then we are already <del>dead</del> permanently fucked.  I&#39;m not sure yet how much I want to engage with anyone in this post.  Mostly because I feel that If I do, all people are going to say is why aren&#39;t I doing anything about it? I have my reasons. Mainly illness and not wanting to get even more jaded. But I&#39;m still interested in hearing different people&#39;s perspectives.  That&#39;s why I come here.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 1: for the people claiming that they are protected by walls and security systems, you must have not heard of protestors literally vandalizing the police stations themselves.  And to the person that said they are too far away, I know people who flew across the country to go to Portland and take part in what was going on there.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT THE SECOND: Ok, many people seem to be missing the point, so maybe I did a bad job explaining it.  When I ask why aren&#39;t there people protesting wealth inequality outside the homes of the super rich, I don&#39;t mean 3 or 4 people.  I mean why aren&#39;t groups of thousands of people showing up at one place to protest?\nI keep hearing &quot;they are scared of the police/getting sued&quot;.  But if that&#39;s the case, why?  why weren&#39;t they scared of the police last year when they were LITERALLY PROTESTING AGAINST THE POLICE? why weren&#39;t they scared of being sued then but are scared now? that&#39;s what I want to know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
