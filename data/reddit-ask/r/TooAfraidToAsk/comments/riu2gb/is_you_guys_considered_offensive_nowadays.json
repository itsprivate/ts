But I also get the idea that it&amp;#39;s weird we can call a group &amp;quot;you guys&amp;quot; whereas &amp;quot;you ladies&amp;quot; when there&amp;#39;s men in the group wouldn&amp;#39;t fly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to hear people&amp;#39;s thoughts on this, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
