  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I (25F) was 19 weeks pregnant when I went to a routine ultrasound and was told my cervix had dilated 2cm. They kept me overnight to put in a cerclage and unfortunately my water broke hours before the scheduled surgery. All tests came back negative so doctors have no official answer for me as to what happened, just possibilities; I have an insufficient cervix or there’s some kind of bacterial infection that harmed the baby. </p>\n\n<p>(TMI but apart of the story) 2/3 weeks before this happened, my mom made a joke about how I don’t shave my bushes (I have an afro (the bush she was referring to) also I let my body hair (the underline of the joke) grow in most times and I’m not as self conscious about it as most women/people can be) and my partner has never made me feel uncomfortable about it or seemed to care. One day my partner was shaving my legs with an electric razor he uses for face and hairline and decided to shave my pubic hair to (my moms home must have gotten to him idk) and I told him not to but he insisted he was almost done anyway so I just let him. This is where it gets gross, so apparently this is the same razor everyone uses in the house (we live with our parents because we are currently working on becoming debt free to buy our first home). I asked him did he wipe it down with alcohol and he said yes. </p>\n\n<p>A day later I have Bacterial Vaginosis, but I don’t know it I just think it’s a yeast infection which I don’t usually get but I’m pregnant so I figure it’s normal right? Wrong, always consult in your doctor before self diagnosing and googling symptoms. Days go by and on like day 3 it’s hurts so bad to pee that my vision is blurry while peeing. Like i start crying when I realize I have to pee! My fiancé takes off work that morning and takes me to get seen at a patient first. I ask him is he sure he wiped the electric shaver down with alcohol and he reveals he only wiped the razor and not the whole handheld device. Vaginas are tough but they’re still really delicate… Got tested at Patient First and what do you know, bacterial vaginosis AND A UTI FROM HOLDING THE PEE. </p>\n\n<p>No one warned me that even after treatment my baby would likely still die. It’s been 3 weeks since she died in my womb and I’m not the same. I’m heartbroken and I have postpartum depression that feels so dumb without the baby at least being here.</p>\n\n<p>I’m angry at everyone, my mom for the dumb ass shady joke, my partner for being… for lack of a better word… reckless, my doctors for their horrible communication with me throughout my pregnancy until the loss of it…, myself for not being firm with my partner about removing my body hair. It’s just that It wasn’t a big deal until it was…</p>\n\n<p>How will I forgive? I love my partner and I love myself but I’m disappointed in us. I respect him and adore him but sometimes I look at him and feel resentment and I don’t like it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
