But I don’t see where we lost any of our freedoms, and therefore don’t understand what these people are talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like I lost any freedoms because of the pandemic. I still went to work as usual (unless I was quarantined for possible exposure). My freedom of speech to talk about Covid never got restricted or censored in any way, I still got to travel to most places freely so as long as I followed protocols like masks or social distancing. I got the Covid-19 vaccine willingly and never felt threatened or coerced into taking it with violence or some other harm, and wearing a mask isn’t/wasn’t me trading my freedoms away; it was part of a group effort to mitigate the pandemic as much as possible. Again, I don’t see how anyone lost their freedoms in any way because of the pandemic. So what am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
