Today my coworker (27F) asked me to go with her to the basement to return some stuff, and I of course agreed (we used the elevator down, she said she didn&amp;#39;t wanna go alone because she is scared that the elevator would stop working)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we are in the basement and we returned the stuff without any trouble, but then went back to the elevator and called it. She pressed the elevator button and waited, then I was striking up a conversation and at that point she was looking at me, rubbing her crotch/vagina and smiled while looking at me. (She didn&amp;#39;t say anything about the small talk I did, she just continued looking at me while smiling)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I of course was pretty &amp;quot;weirded out&amp;quot; while she was rubbing her privates while looking at me, but I just ignored it and carried on talking about random stuff while keeping a neutral face)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We noticed someone else already called the elevator up 4 floors, so she didn&amp;#39;t wanna wait. We then went up the stairs instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day she was behaving &amp;quot;normally&amp;quot; and went by her business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think of this happening? Was she trying to hint at something?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt that it was a coincidence, because she mad it tooo obvious that she was trying to get a response from me regarding the thing she did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
