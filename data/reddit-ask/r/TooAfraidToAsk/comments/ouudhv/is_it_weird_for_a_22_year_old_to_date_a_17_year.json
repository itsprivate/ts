It&#39;s good to know, rather than going for it and being shunned by people I know. Just so I&#39;m aware for the future, when does the age gap become not weird, when its 22/18, 23/19, 24/20? Gathering opinions is helpful as I am more than happy to just remain friends and keep it open as an option in the future if neither of us has a partner by then.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
