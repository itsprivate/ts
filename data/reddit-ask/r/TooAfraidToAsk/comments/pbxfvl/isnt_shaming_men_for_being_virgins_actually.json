One of the things I&#39;ve noticed from reddit is that men in Western society have immense pressure on them to lose their virginity. The word virgin is actually used as insult a lot of times. The go to insult is, &quot; He probably lives in his mom&#39;s basement and can&#39;t get laid&quot; lol. </p>\n\n<p>So basically my point is, when somebody shames men for being virgins, aren&#39;t they actually objectifying women? They are posing women as sexual objects that men must conquer in order to be deemed respectable members of the society and somehow not getting laid indicates something wrong with them. Doesn&#39;t this reduce women to mere sexual objects and intimacy with them a social currency? Could this be a reason that men respond aggressively to rejection and sometimes go down rabbit holes like inceldom?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
