We only indulge in mutual masterbation. Usually its me giving him head and then him fingering me till I cum. He says he doesn&#39;t enjoy sex anymore because its painful. When he tries to put it in, the foreskin gets pulled back which is painful. Is that a thing? None of my previous boyfriends had this issue. Lately when he&#39;s fingering me and playing with my tits there&#39;s no boner. That&#39;s a mood killer.</p>\n\n<p>We bought lube and condoms to help him with the pain but he still doesn&#39;t seem keen on entering me even though I&#39;ve suggested it multiple times. I feel deprived, unsatisfied and horny.\nMy boyfriend said I can go and get other dick if I need it, since he cannot give it to me. \nI am not interested in other dick at the moment because I can&#39;t do one night stands. It&#39;s not me. I want to be fucked like a ho, by my loving partner. </p>\n\n<p>I am confused and kinda sad. I wonder if he&#39;s a closet gay. Or if I dont interest him anymore. Or if it&#39;s really just the pain. But what about the limp dick and very little sexual initiation from him? Is he asexual? He&#39;s been a porn addict for years. He says he doesn&#39;t watch it anymore. But I think he does. I think he prefers watching porn and doing himself rather than doing me. I am not sure. What do you guys think? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, I already feel better typing this out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
