I love my born children, but I seriously wasn’t very upset over the miscarriages. I think I cried once over the first one and that was it. But when I’ve talked with other women and mentioned it, they are so, so sorry. Like it was a tragedy. And some of them said they grieved for years over their lost children. One even kept her 9 week embryo in her freezer, waiting to save the money for cremation.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking “dude, I just flushed the toilet.” Okay, one came out with a giant cramp, and I felt it in my underwear so I rinsed it off and examined it because it was interesting. Then I flushed it.</p>\n\n<p>For reference, I adore my children. I take good care of them, love them, breastfed them, and now I’m sad my two teenagers may move out in the next couple years. So it’s not like I’m heartless.</p>\n\n<p>But am I heartless? I get grieving a pregnancy that is lost later on, but 10 weeks or less? I don’t understand why it seems to be expected.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
