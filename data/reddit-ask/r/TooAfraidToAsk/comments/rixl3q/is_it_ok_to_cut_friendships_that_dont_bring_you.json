Simply to say, I’m not happy when I hang out with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left the group chat, but they added me back in, and the friends are privately messaging me if I’m free on that date for meet up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m just ignoring all of them. At this point, I’m wondering if what I am doing is right, or should I tell them straight that I don’t want the friendships anymore. I’m not someone that is good at confronting straight, and normally just prefer ignoring people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
