For me personally I don’t want to because I have two chronic illnesses that one or both will be passed on and I could never knowingly have a child that’s someday gonna come to me and tell me how they don’t feel good and that spirals into the same diagnoses that I have. My parents are so pushy and think that I’m still going to have at least one because “they will give your life purpose”. I feel like I have a lot of purpose without a kid. Anyone else’s parents do this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
