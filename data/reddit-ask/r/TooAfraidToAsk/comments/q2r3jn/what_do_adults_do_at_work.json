In my current role some days are just not busy and I can complete all my tasks and don’t have any additional work scheduled. I feel guilty for not working and still being paid. I’m just wondering if this is common, and if so, what do others do to fill the work day? Am I supposed to ask for more work? I know I probably come across as very naive, but I genuinely have no idea if this is normal, and would really appreciate others’ insight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
