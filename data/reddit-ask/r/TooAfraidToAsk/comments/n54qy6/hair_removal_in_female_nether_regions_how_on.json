I already shave the hair on the mons pubis every week and keep everything else on the vulva trimmed with scissors every so often, it’s all I know how to do. I use scissors for the vulva because I have no idea how to use a razor between the labia. I’ve already accidentally cut my labia minora with scissors a couple times, and plucking in the majora hurts. I feel like I’d just wreak havoc if I dared to stick a razor there given how flappy the area is. It’s like trying to shave the inside of a hotdog bun without cutting the hot dog. How do women do this? I went on Google but it just gives me articles and diagrams, and I’m a visual learner so I want to see if I can find actual video for demonstration. I have bad eyesight and light colored hair, so I’m also curious about how to leave less hair behind. I’m a little afraid of getting waxing done by a professional.",
