Every night, he snuggles up against my chest... and pushes his way under my arm, so that it is wrapped around him. \n\nHe is a small dog, who somehow consumes most of the bed. By the end of the night, I am practically falling off.... I even sometimes find myself scooting closer to the edge so he has more room.\n\nDuring the day, he is extremely timid and easily frightened. He has been this way since he was a puppy. \n\nWhen he’s sleeping, he just looks so peaceful and content. I do everything in my power to ensure he keeps that peace. Even if that means Im wrapped up like a pretzel, while hanging half way off the bed.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this with their fur children? Or am I officially a crazy person?",
