But both my bunnies are store bought. I walked in with cash, walked out with rabbit, no questions asked.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be a great candidate for adoption, but contacting and trying to set something up with shelters is so hard I am considering just buying another rabbit. I told myself I&#39;d adopt from here on out, but this is so stressful. Maybe it&#39;s stressful because I&#39;m autistic, but buying a pet at the store has never been hard, so there&#39;s something going on.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t adoption shelters want animals to be adopted? Why be so controlling if the alternative is going to a pet store or euthanizing the animal? And if animal shelters need to do these steps by law, then why not apply those same laws to pet stores? </p>\n\n<p>I just want to give a bunny a good home without all the scrutiny and invasiveness. :(</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
