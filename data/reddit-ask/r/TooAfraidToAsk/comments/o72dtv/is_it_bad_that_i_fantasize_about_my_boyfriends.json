He fantasizes about letting another guy use me while he watches and tells me what to do. Honestly when he first told me this I was a bit confused but the more we talk about it, it’s starting to become my fantasy as well. But the thing that I feel like I can never tell him is that I fantasize about his best friend being the third. It feels so hot imagining my boyfriend letting his best friend do whatever he wants to me and having my boyfriend tell me what to do. This feels like such a guilty thought and I don’t even find his best friend that attractive tbh. Idk if I should bring this up with my boyfriend, even if I were too idk how. Is it bad that I think this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
