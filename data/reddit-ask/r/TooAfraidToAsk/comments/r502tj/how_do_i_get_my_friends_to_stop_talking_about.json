It’s either self-degrading or racist, sometime productive. But when I’m out I don’t want to bask in self-pity or political talk. When things get quiet, it goes back to race. When the conversation is elsewhere, it is redirected to race or gossip. How do I revert or redirect the convo without mentioning that I am or sounding annoyed/ judgy. It happens in other groups too. I just don’t like the trauma bonding.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am not white. Stating this for context. I am not interested in the opinion that I don’t care about racial issues cause it doesn’t affect me. It does! I just don’t want to talk about it all the time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
