I’ve also seen these two terms used in friendships when one of the friends is venting about the other to someone else. Someone venting to a third party about you doesn’t automatically mean that they’re fake or toxic. If they’re spreading lies and just talking shit about you, that’s completely different. However, if you’re doing something problematic, them venting to a third party about it doesn’t make them toxic or fake. Should they talk to you about it and try to solve the problem? Absolutely, but I think my point still stands. \n\nI feel like these words are used so vaguely and loosely as well. It’s like...ok...? How exactly were they toxic? “Fake” in what way? \n\nI’ve even seen and met countless people using these terms hypocritically and/or when they’re just psychologically projecting. They’ll be backstabbing and shit-talking people fucking constantly, and then once other people start doing the same to them, they’re all of a sudden upset and they’re “so done with fake/toxic people.” Like...come on lmao. Give me a fucking break. Similar to what I said at the beginning of this paragraph, a lot of the time, the other person/people they’re referring to isn’t/aren’t even toxic or fake. THEY are the toxic ones, THEY are the fake ones. Anyway, I think you get what I’m saying.\n\nIdk tho, does anyone else feel this way?",
