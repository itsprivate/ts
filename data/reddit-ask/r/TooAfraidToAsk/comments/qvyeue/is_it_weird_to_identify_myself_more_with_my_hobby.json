People in my family talk about how it&#39;s so amazing that I serve and that being in the military is &quot;a calling,&quot; and people I work with often talk about how dedicated they are to their careers and how they work hard to strengthen their skills to be the best they can be.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing for me - it&#39;s just a job. I joined because I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do with my life, and the only reason I work hard at it and rise through the ranks is to provide for my family and be financially comfortable. On the side as a hobby I write music. I&#39;m not particularly successful at it (I maybe have a total of 200 views on my YouTube channel and like 13 subscribers) and I don&#39;t make any money at it, but I love doing it. I&#39;ve played live in a few places in town and was pretty well-received and my co-workers enjoy my stuff. Because of this, I consider myself a musician way more than I consider myself a member of the military. Also for security reasons I don&#39;t like telling random people that I&#39;m in the military so I usually identify myself as a freelance musician. People say it&#39;s weird that I do that, and I&#39;ve had someone tell me that &quot;there&#39;s a word for people who identify themselves by their hobbies and interests so intensely,&quot; whatever that means.</p>\n\n<p>So is that weird?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
