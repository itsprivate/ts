And I just feel like the world has passed me by. I’ve kept in touch with all my friends and still talk to them almost daily. I’m still dating a girl I used to to go school with and overall I feel I should be happy. I like my online school and I love all the extra free time but I still can’t help but feel like I’ve missed so much. </p>\n\n<p>I have to keep reminding myself that other people probably feel the same way and that everyone’s had to do virtual stuff for over a year now. Even now some people are still doing virtual school and not going back yet. And everyone’s had to get used to not getting to do outside things with other people. But that’s why I’m posting this to truly see if other people do feel this way. I feel like I’ve lost my high school experience and I still feel like I’m 15.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
