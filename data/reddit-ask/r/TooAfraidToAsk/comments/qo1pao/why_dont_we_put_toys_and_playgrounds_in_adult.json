You just don&#39;t stop loving Lego or electric toy trains as you turn 18. You don&#39;t stop enjoying playing on a slide or swing. As adults we have to go to &quot;adult&quot; places to do &quot;adult&quot; things, fill documents and wait in lines and as I see, many adults don&#39;t enjoy just sitting on a chair or standing in a line. We make play rooms for kids so they don&#39;t get bored when we go shopping or something, and they swim in pools filled with plastic balls, they jump on trampolines, they build houses from lego, they play with hot wheels cars... Why don&#39;t we do that for adults? It would make us calmer and enjoy life a bit more I think. We wouldn&#39;t get dirty because plastic balls can&#39;t stain your white collar and you will slide down the slide perfectly in your pencil skirt. Is there a reason or did people just not think about that before?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
