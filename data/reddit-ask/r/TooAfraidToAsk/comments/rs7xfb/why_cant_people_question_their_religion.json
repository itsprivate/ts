Wondering about things shouldn’t be seen as “oh they’re a non believer” or anything wrong. Why is it so hard to then answer those kinds of questions? Why don’t religious practices include discourse about the religion itself? It would be more interesting and engaging to actually interpret the religious texts in different ways. Doesn’t have to mean that we doubt anything, we’re just trying to understand. There’s a lot of plot holes and such, especially when comparing and contrasting multiple religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
