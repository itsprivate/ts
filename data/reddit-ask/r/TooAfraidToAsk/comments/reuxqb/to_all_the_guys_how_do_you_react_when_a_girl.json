  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation about this with one of my girl friends. She insisted that, as a girl, you should never, ever, go ahead and admit to a guy that you like him, because the minute you show yourself too eager, he will back away. That this is some sort of reverse psychology backed up by dating coaches and all that and that guys like the thrill of the chase so you should play hard to get. The thing is, she added: especially with the guys who are unsure about what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The context is that I&amp;#39;ve recently told a guy that I like him and would like to see him again and he effectively ended up ghosting me after. My friend said I should&amp;#39;ve never done that and I should&amp;#39;ve let him make all the moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that a guy who is emotionally mature and who knows what he wants would not be driven away by a girl making the first move or any kind of move. He does not owe it to me to like me back, but at least have the decency to tell me you don&amp;#39;t feel the same and that&amp;#39;s that. It will suck, but I will move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;d still like to know: is there some validity to all that reverse psychology thing? Is it really like that, are you drawn to girls who are playing hard to get and turned off by girls who show and tell you they want you too?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
