Makes enough sense, but shouldn&amp;#39;t that logic hold even stronger for people? And before anyone jumps on me for supporting such a controversial thing, it&amp;#39;s the opposite. I personally find it hard to imagine euthanizing a pet for the same reason I find it hard to justify for a person. Plus, the pet can&amp;#39;t consent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like we overwhelmingly agree that a person&amp;#39;s life should be extended by any possible means, because more time with loved ones is worth any amount of suffering. But when it&amp;#39;s a pet (and let&amp;#39;s be honest, many are closer to their pets than all but a handful of people) we just say nah?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
