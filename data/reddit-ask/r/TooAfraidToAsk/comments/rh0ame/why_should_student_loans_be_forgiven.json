There is no ambiguity to this process and it should be absolutely zero surprise to anyone who takes out a loan when they are expected to repay it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why do we have a society of people who are now acting so shocked and stunned that they have to repay the money they are contractually obligated to repay? Further, why are so many people acting entitled to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; paying this money back as if they did not sign a voluntary contract agreeing to do so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand how getting rid of this debt can free up people to stimulate the economy in other ways, but what sort of precedent does this set? You can just borrow without any responsibility whatsoever and the government will come save you? And people who study at universities within their financial means get screwed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every argument I’ve ever seen in favor of this boils down to “I made a bad decision with money and I should just not have to face the consequences of my choice.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
