  "selftext": "To give you guys a bit of context, I never met my grandfather since he passed away before I was born but I always had a very close relationship with his brother since he was the closest to a grandfather I've ever known and a great man to me.\n\nHe has 3 children. The youngest being 35, the next one 41 and the oldest 44. I've been visiting him every week throughout my life frankly because he's like that cool uncle and very close to my father too. By the time I was about 14 years old I stopped seeing any of his children around, like ever. They slowly moved out and carried on with their lives. I'd eventually ask and he'd say that they're fine, doing their lives. One day he opened up and told me that they never had a great relationship, it was partly his fault and partly theirs. \nIt's a religious family so if you're living under his roof It's his rules obviously (within reason) but as he grew older and his health deteriorated (cancer) they felt more comfortable doing stuff he wouldn't allow in his house like smoking weed, bringing girls around... he got fed up and kicked them out. \n\nIt turns out that since telling them to move elsewhere (they were adults and working already) they never stepped foot in his place or picked up his calls, neither of them. \n\nOver the years his health kept getting worse and worse so I'd bring him food from home a few times a week and watch WWE together, play cards, ask him for advice or helping him in whatever he needed, I felt like it was a stress free place to go with someoneI liked so it was no big deal helpinghim in whatever I could...\n\nHe recently passed away and it hit me hard, they say it was because of his health condition, it pissed me off but I'm doing better.\n\nNow, the wife and him were separated and she passed away years ago, all the family he had alive was my father, me and my siblings and his own kids. I received a call saying that he left me something on his inheritance.\n\nI went there and it turns out that he left me 67k, I lost breath for a second since I never in a million years would've thought about will or inheritance from him to me or that he even had that kind of money. He left the rest of his assets/cash from the bank to some of my siblings and parents. Gave some to charity, some to friends but nothing to his children, zero. He didn't have a vast amount of wealth, humble life, low expenses... so it caught me off guard when I found out that most of his inheritance was for me alone. The children found out obviously and they aren't happy, they say that they deserve that money and not me, so I should give it to them. The 3 of them are a mess. Not doing drugs or anything but barely ever tried to accomplish anything in life so doing anything to get by... I'm 25 now and make a cool amount of money, not a lot but I live very comfortably. It makes me feel bad that their dad left them nothing and they aren't doing great financially but at the same time deep inside I know that they don't deserve it. They didn't even attend the funeral but expected money? That's below low. I understand that I'll have to pay taxes on it and I've been spending time investigating about everything I'll have to do until I'm clear. I wanted to use part of the money to pay for 2 of my sister's Uni (roughly 32k combined but not yet, they're still in high school) and keep the rest in a high interest savings account since my parents themselves got a fairly substantial amount too until I decide what to do with some of it because I have no debt.\n\nDo you guys think I should give them a part of what I got given by his dad or not?\n\nTl;dr: my uncles want me to give them the inheritance their father gave me because he left them nothing. He left them nothing because they pretty much abandoned him.",
