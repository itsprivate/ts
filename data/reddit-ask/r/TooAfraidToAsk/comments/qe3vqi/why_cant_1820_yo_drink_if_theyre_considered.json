Yet they can&#39;t buy their own drinks and cigarettes until they are precisely 21. In my native country 18 counts as the age of major, which increases my disbelief. I think that if someone can start a family, study prestigious majors at college, live an utterly autonomous life, he is able to drink an occasional drink. What&#39;s the logic here? Parents can do the full parental duties and then when they&#39;re offered a drink by their peers they have to decline since they&#39;re underage? As an avid drinker myself it seems unfathomable. Is this law really implemented and enforced?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
