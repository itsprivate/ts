  "selftext": "When my little sister was presented an iPad as Christmas present, she fell in love with it. I caught her once watching Peppa pig and thought okay that doesn’t seem too harmful. A few minutes later I came back and it showed Peppa pig gouging out the father pigs eyes out and the baby pig talking in a really deep voice. I took the iPad away and scrubbed the history and tried to remove any trace of Peppa pig on the iPad. It came up again and this guy was talking about how the next video will be a treat and there will be more mutilation to come. I took the iPad away for about 3 months after that.\n\n I forgot about the whole ordeal until this morning when my little sister was talking about a dog who’s legs were being cut off. It took me by surprise because she’s usually disgusted with anything blood and she loves animals. She described the dog having “red” all over its hair(fur). The strange thing was I had just put on blippi( a children’s YouTuber) for her to watch and checked the side bar for anything that might be unsafe and there wasn’t anything that might’ve showed anything like that.  I asked her what she pressed and she told me she clicked on the video with the Barbie dolls and at apparently at one point in the video, instead of Barbie dolls, it switched to a dog being maimed. I told her to show me and she ran off and I barely saw a glimpse of the video before she promptly closed the tab(I’m still pretty fucking mad that she did that). \n\nI have her iPad with me right now and I’m curious as to why people portray a video for kids, but instead include some NSFL content mid-video? I’ve heard stories of it happening to other people’s children as well.",
