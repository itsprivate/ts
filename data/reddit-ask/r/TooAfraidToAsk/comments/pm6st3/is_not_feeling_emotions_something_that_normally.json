Like, when I was a kid, I could really FEEL emotions even when nothing unusual was happening and I experienced life much more \"vividly\", whereas nowadays I feel almost nothing even when something super dramatic happens.",

  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I remember that when I was a kid, everything I did and experienced, even ordinary things that I did on a daily basis, invoked some emotion in me. It&#39;s really hard to describe, but for example, when I went for a walk outside, the birds chirping, the wind blowing against my face, the smell of flowers blooming in the warm afternoon, the sunlight radiating against my skin, etc. all really made me feel something. Like, I experienced all these things really vividly and the overall atmosphere really made me feel emotions. It&#39;s impossible for me to describe, but it felt like life had some &quot;flavor&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m 19 years old now and nowadays my surroundings don&#39;t make me feel any emotions anymore. I don&#39;t experience the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of my surroundings anymore like when I was a kid. It&#39;s as if my life back when I was a kid was a magical, vivid, full color fantasy movie whereas nowadays it&#39;s all a bland, monotonous, black and white video. Everything I experience feels so much less vivid and nothing invokes any emotion in me anymore. Not only do I no longer feel the atmosphere and &quot;mood&quot; of my physical surroundings anymore, but events that happen in my life don&#39;t make me feel anything either. For example, two of our dogs that I&#39;ve been around since my childhood died recently and I didn&#39;t  even feel any sadness even though I loved both of them. When I go outside nowadays, I don&#39;t EXPERIENCE things like birdsong or the scent of flowers anymore the way I felt them when I was a kid. It&#39;s like all the zest and flavor has just disappeared from my life. </p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t been officially diagnosed with depression, but for the past three years I&#39;ve felt extremely sad almost every day. Sometimes I can pinpoint the thought/thing that&#39;s making me sad, but on some days I really hvae no idea why I feel sad. During my first year of high school it was so bad that I actually physically cried quite often, and I pretty much spent most of my time just lying in bed and doing nothing after I got home from school. As a kid I was happy and full of life, but these past three years have been so bad that I&#39;ve become a diehard antinatalist and I no longer plan to have children later in life because I don&#39;t want future generations to experience something this bad. I don&#39;t think I have depression because I can still perform my daily tasks normally and my grades are top notch, but even if it isn&#39;t depression, I&#39;m no longer sure whether what I&#39;m experiencing is normal because I feel like if it was normal, humanity would&#39;ve gone extinct by now. I&#39;m not going to k1ll m¥s3lf, but I feel like at this point the only reason I&#39;m living is that I&#39;m waiting for my life to be over and the faster it&#39;s over the better it is for me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
