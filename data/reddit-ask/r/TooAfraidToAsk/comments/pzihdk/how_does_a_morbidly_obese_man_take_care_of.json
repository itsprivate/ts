I got this layer of dirt that sits on my body, that i can&#39;t rid of. I just want help, whatever i ask, I mostly get ignored and the times that i do, it some surface level stuff like smile more. I just want to be normal. Also, what does a self care routine look like. All my life I&#39;ve felt like a freak. I have never felt comfort in my body . Just disgusted with myself. There is a picture in a previous post in my profile.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:I don&#39;t know if it will make a significant difference,  but I am black.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
