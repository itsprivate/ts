  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all I accept all races, and judge people by their personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about the expression &amp;quot;People of color&amp;quot;, and I think it&amp;#39;s a weird expression. I have a few thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s basically a mild form of racial segregation, separating white people from all other races.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It kinda implies without much context that &amp;quot;white people&amp;quot; are the default, and coloured people are just variations  (Like a white canvas, being painted on).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apperantly its a old expression first used in the 18th century, to separate white people free people, from slaves. The difference today is, it separates coloured people from white people, while back then it separated white people from coloured people (If that even makes sense)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having a people of color category implies that all ethnicities besides white goes through the same struggles and shares values in some form. In reality they all have different cultures, and are as different to each other, as white people and some other race. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This expression originated in the US, where white people is the majority, so I can see why this expression can be useful in certain statistical situations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The expression has spread out a lot around the world, especially in the west, and isn&amp;#39;t as relevant in a lot of countries. I just think it kinda amplifies what the expression is actually trying to combat. It&amp;#39;s pouring fuel on a fire that is already burning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like the expression, it doesn&amp;#39;t help any race. I think it&amp;#39;s discriminating towards POC, but also against white people, as it kinda implies White people VS POC.   It makes white people stand alone, and ignores the huge differences of other races.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand how this expression is so normalised and accepted? What good does it bring to the table?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Btw, I’m not from the US, so while we have our own problems, I haven’t experienced the US problems first hand!\nAlso made some corrections (race instead of ethnicity, ups)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
