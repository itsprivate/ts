It started out alright but about a year in, he started talking about how he was depressed and suicidal and how I was the only thing keeping him from killing himself. Then this transitioned to him saying that when we didn’t have sex often enough he felt like I didn’t care about him keeping himself alive and as soon as I stopped sleeping with him he would kill himself. He would force me to leave school in the middle of the day to sleep with him and when we went days without doing this he would say how he’d started planning his death again. When I tried to tell school administrators about this he told me that he would just lied to them and that if I told anyone again he’d go through with it. When I tried to leave the relationship at one point he texted me for hours saying how he was going to go through with it unless I came back to him. </p>\n\n<p>There was one instance that I’m fairly certain was assault where I woke up in the middle of the night to him trying to have sex with me even though I was asleep. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually I got out of the relationship. He did attempt suicide at our senior trip but wasn’t successful. He’s still alive as far as I know. </p>\n\n<p>I have been to years of therapy since and am now in a healthy, happy relationship where my boundaries are respected.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been saying that this was an emotionally and/or sexually abusive since then but haven’t referred to it as rape or sexual assault and was wondering it it would be classified as that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
