For about a decade now I've been perpetually tired, generally on the verge of tears, and hard to motivate for anything.\n\nI obsess over things (though nothing truly productive), like that time I watched, read, rewatched, reread in a different language, listened to the audiobooks, and rewatched Harry Potter; or that time I binged The Office on a loop for months; or New Girl, or Community, or Archer, or Brooklyn 99, or Arrested Development, or BoJack Horseman, or Sherlock, or Mindhunter... you get it. Or that time I impulse-bought a PS4 and played RDR2 for half a year, and then TLOU, and now I'm replaying TLOU2 for the sixth (6th!) time and recording it to edit into a watchable series instead of working for school. Like, what the hell am I doing? Anything to keep myself busy and distracted non-stop.\n\nI've seen multiple psychologists, all of which told me anti-depressants were a last resort and that I should try different solutions first. They warned me that it dulls all of your emotions, not just the bad ones (which makes sense I guess, but they make it seem like you never feel anything at all). \n\nSo, I've tried exercise, structuring my days, \"healthier\" diets, socialising, sticking to a tight sleep schedule, one even told me to stop cursing so much? Did it help? Did I fuck. And sooner or later, in true sadsupervillain fashion, I gave up on the therapy because it just didn't help and it's expensive.\n\nWhat do anti-depressants do? Is it really that bad? Does it help? Should I ask for them? Even insist? \n\nI'm at the end of my rope here.",
