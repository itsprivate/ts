  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So a few weeks ago I found my boyfriend was subscribed to an onlyfans. we were looking at his phone when the charge text came up. so perfect. i ask what that was and he just kept saying what what, as if I didn&#39;t see what the charge was for. I was so hurt. Months ago he was going through his email and i thought I had seen an onlyfans email and I even asked but he ignored me and for some reason I didn&#39;t press him about it. But once I saw this text it was so clear. I was so upset and angry and hurt, I left his house for a while but ended up going back. I told him how hurt I was. To me personally it feels offensive for my partner to pay for a woman&#39;s nudes, especially when we hadn&#39;t been having sex, he doesn&#39;t really spend money on me because hes not currently working. So knowing he willingly just sends someone else money monthly, no matter what the price is, fucked me up.</p>\n\n<p>I asked him who it was, I don&#39;t know why I want to see. I want to know who it is,  since he said it was some random girl on his explore page and not &quot;someone he follows&quot;, I want to know how much he was paying but he refuses to show me. He said he deleted his account when I left and I believe him. But now I don&#39;t trust him. He&#39;s asking me to try. But now all I think about is wanting to know who it is, wondering if hell make another account and how he&#39;s just going to be more cautious and sneaky. Now hes trying to be more lovey dovey but Im like a stone I feel so cold I cant reciprocate it. Ive been having really disturbing nightmares about awful things happening to me daily since it happened and I just figured out it might be from that. I feel like Im being silenced and just being forced to move on and get over it because he refused to answer my questions. I feel like I cant talk to anyone about this because its so embarrassing, like I cant even talk to my best friend about it Im ashamed and I did nothing wrong. I dont know why this affected me so hard. I dont forgive him. Is it wrong for me to be hurt over this? I wouldnt be bothered if it was just porn but something about him paying a specific girl just hurts me so much. I thought our relationship was good til now I question everything. I dont know what to do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
