I am very communicative, I do well with colleagues, I hang out with my tennis club, and film club from time to time. But I have not met people who I would be inherently interested in being friends with. And its killing me that my friends from my home country (who I consider to be my best friends) keep saying that they feel sorry for me. My family says so too. But I am sorry, finding people that you actually want to share your life with is next to impossible. Some people get VERY lucky, and others just pretend like everyone is their best friend. I do not want to make friends just for the sake of it, just so that I can think to myself &amp;quot;well at least I hang out with people, rather than sitting at home by myself&amp;quot;. Just no. I would rather spend 2 months by myself, doing things I love, texting people I care about overseas, rather than be pretend-friends with people I couldnt care less. Being alone is NOT ALWAYS being lonely. And sure is not always better than being around someone. I am tried of this &amp;quot;solution for depression&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
