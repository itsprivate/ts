I tell her to initiate something and hop on top or do the work and she is extremly adamant about not doing the work and that &quot;I should just want to do it&quot; because I&#39;m the guy. It gets tiring after a while and if she were to start initiatiating it and at least doing the work for the first half, I&#39;ll gladly do the work for the second half on my days that I&#39;m tired or just not that sexually interested (5 days out of the week). Is my libido low for being a 27 year old? She&#39;s been getting pretty upset with me lately but it&#39;s just with full time school and work I am not as energetic when it&#39;s late at night and she wants to have sex. She says I don&#39;t love her anymore or find her attractive which isn&#39;t the case, but I&#39;m not going to lie It&#39;s also a mature relationship so I&#39;m not trying to have sex daily like I did when we first started dating.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
