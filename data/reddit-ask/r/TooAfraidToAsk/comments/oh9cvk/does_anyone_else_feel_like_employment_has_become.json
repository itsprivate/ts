Why are we supposed to not question the idea that employment may not be for everyone? I see a lot of people who are averse to careers and don&#39;t believe that employment should be a requirement to survive. Then millions of people come down hard on them, calling them &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;lazy,&quot; &quot;loser,&quot; &quot;freeloader&quot; etc. I wonder why people are so defensive about, not work per se, but about maintaining work culture even if it&#39;s hurting us and creating toxic environments. People act like working 40+ hrs a week is a flex. Others put their employment/careers ahead of families/marriage to climb ladders. It kind of makes me sad for them. Why do the working people care so much about what non-working people do? Has work become a new religion?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
