I don&#39;t expect it to be given for for nothing. I used that money for a host of other things besides tuition. Rent, clothes, vodka, etc. So I&#39;m more than willing to pay back what I borrowed. If INTEREST were forgiven, my current balance would be roughly $24,000. </p>\n\n<p>Many students who have been paying longer than me have already made payments totaling GREATER than the sum of their loans, and could even get money BACK.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing how quickly my principal has dropped during the interest freeze due to the pandemic has shown just how much faster the money can be paid back if it wasn&#39;t being diverted and simply generating additional revenue for the federal government.</p>\n\n<p>(Edit: formatting)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
