I didnt even last a week. It sucks because I studied 6 years at a university for this and now I have absolutely no interest to pursue it. Im not rich and I have to work, but im completely lost in life. Are all jobs like this? From 9 to 7, always dealing with boring emails and insipid people, waiting for the weekend for the rest of my life. Is this something I just have to accept and face?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
