Most of the severe situations in life just don&#39;t faze me, but the little stuff does. </p>\n\n<p>Things like fights near me, cops showing up, disasters occurring, emotional outbursts, death, arguments etc. just don&#39;t do it for me. I can be calm, cool, collected, almost seemingly disinterested. </p>\n\n<p>But things like someone talking annoyingly will stress me out. Someone asking me for a favor when I&#39;m not in the mood stresses me out. Anxious, hypothetical thoughts stress me out. Knocking into something stresses me out for a time. Forgetting something and having to go back stresses me out. Someone not listening stresses me out.</p>\n\n<p>This pandemic hasn&#39;t stressed me out at all. I don&#39;t care. I&#39;ll wear the mask, I took the vaccine, I read on it because it&#39;s a hot topic. But I don&#39;t care. Not about the drama, &quot;what&#39;s in the vaccine&quot;, not political dumbasses (from both sides), not the deaths, the spread, the new variants. Literally don&#39;t give a shit. Someone could tell me there&#39;s a new variant that kills 50% of people and I&#39;d be like &quot;well, goddamn&quot; and do my best to prevent it, be cautious, but no stress. I&#39;d certainly be interested, though. I mean FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE? </p>\n\n<p>In any of the stressful scenarios to others, I&#39;m like &quot;Jesus Christ, calm down&quot; and I&#39;ll sometimes tell them it&#39;s not that bad, or why we&#39;ll be fine, or advise direction. But the minor inconveniences, the nothings frustrate me and get me ranting about life. Then others tell me &quot;why are you complaining over this little thing&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>What is up with me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
