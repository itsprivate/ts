I always feel terrible and can’t get the courage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So tonight, for example, I just got back from a date, he was nice and we got along. Things got physical and despite my knowing he was definitely not my type long term or someone I’d likely see again, we started getting intimate. He said he wanted to just put it in and I didn’t have the guts to tell him to wear a condom before he penetrated me. I was frustrated with myself but realised it was too late before I came to my senses. I felt stressed the whole time and now I feel like a piece of dirt for not only being spineless but for letting someone do this again when I don’t want it. I promised myself I wouldn’t let it happen again. It’s happened three times now since I’ve been dating and the other two times the guy just did it without asking. I don’t know how I’m supposed to go forward because I don’t want to feel like this anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TIA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
