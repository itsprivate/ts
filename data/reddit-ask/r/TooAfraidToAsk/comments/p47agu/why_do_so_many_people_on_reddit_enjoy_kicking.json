I’ve seen people post about suffering with depression or struggling with a situation and there’s always a douchbag in the comments saying it’s al OPs fault and they don’t try at all to help themselves. Yesterday, in a sub I posted about haing not talked to my best friend in almost two months and how it’s making me fall apart and multiple people told me it’s probably all my fault and my friend probably had been holding resentment for a while. Keep in mind, I hadn’t even explained the whole situation. So, of course I’ve just been an anxious mess the whole night. I also remember posting on specific sub about feeling insecure and some guy said I’m attention seeking and how “girls like you piss me off, thinking you deserve the world” (dont know where that came from). It just seems pathetic to go on someone’s post and make them feel bad when it’s obvious they’re already in a pit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
