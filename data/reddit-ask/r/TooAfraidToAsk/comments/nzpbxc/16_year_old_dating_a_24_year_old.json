They do everything bf and gf do and they’ve had sex. She told me and I voiced my concerns about it because obviously I don’t approve. And I don’t know her boyfriend but I see him as a predator, because at 24 there should be no reason you would want to date someone who’s 16. She is very stubborn and if I or anyone in my family tried to put a stop to this she wouldn’t listen at all (as most 16 year old girls would). So I feel like there’s nothing I can do. I told her if he oversteps in any direction or makes her feel trapped or uncomfortable I am going to put him in a coma. I feel like my only option is to let her know I’m a safe space if she needs me. Since there’s no way to convince her this isn’t okay. Is there anything else I can do? I want her to know she has at least one person she can go to if he does anything since she won’t tell anyone else. But I really don’t approve of this relationship.\n\nAlso they work together so even if someone was able to make them break up it would be very easy for them to sneak around because they’re around each other a lot.",
