He sings from low to high pitch squeals just about yelling that I don’t really understand what he is saying. </p>\n\n<p>He either sits in the front garden or front verandah and lets his lungs out.</p>\n\n<p>By all means I hope he is enjoying himself but I can literally hear him inside my house 20-30m down the street watching tv. His voice must get sore. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to be an asshole and say something but it’s insane how loud he is, I couldn’t imagine being the neighbours living directly next door. </p>\n\n<p>I know it’s not his fault, and he’s not doing it maliciously to annoy anyone, and it must be hard on his patents, but damn it’s next level to a point I can’t relax or study uni. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? And no ear plugs don’t work, they just muffle noise not cancel it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
