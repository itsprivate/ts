  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More of a rant post but curious about people&amp;#39;s thoughts - this story has put me in an overall wrathful state and it&amp;#39;s hard not to think that perhaps within the next 25 years, I may be telling a son of mine &amp;quot;if ANY teacher of yours&amp;#39; is trying to be more than that, get the hell away from them&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m of the opinion it&amp;#39;s absolutely fucking pathetic how the media are insinuating with their headlines that a 15 year old boy is actually capable of willingly being in a legitimate relationship with a 47 year old woman. Give. Me. A. Fucking. Break. God. Damnit! I was 15 five years ago, and let me tell you, I see things very differently to how I did back then. I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s the case for virtually anyone (for example, I wasn&amp;#39;t constantly thinking about landing a good career, how I&amp;#39;m going to achieve home ownership, etc., you get the idea). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why the fuck does a basic concept known as &amp;quot;regardless of your gender, molesting a minor is wrong&amp;quot; go over these tossers&amp;#39; heads? I could not give a damn in the slightest about notions about women being less harmless: it does not mean that they are not capable of being in a position of authority and taking advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People seem to be focusing on the cage fighter man&amp;#39;s actions. I vehemently disapprove of how the boy got attacked by the old bastard for obvious reasons. However, I genuinely struggle to have sympathy for the wench who got murdered. Can&amp;#39;t help but think she bears some responsibility for the boy having to go through being attacked by a thug - if she simply stuck with professional boundaries, then surely the boy would not have had all this harm coming his way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll also add: it grinds my gears how it&amp;#39;s common for parents to think they only need to be concerned about their girls being preyed on. Many different things, the way I perceive it, make a teenage boy easy prey precisely because of certain things being pushed as normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
