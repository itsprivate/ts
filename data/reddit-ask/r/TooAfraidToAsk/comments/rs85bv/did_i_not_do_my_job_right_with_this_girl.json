I had given it my all during foreplay and she really enjoyed it as she very explicitly told me during. After I finished I went down on her again and when we were done I asked if she came. She said she didn’t and kissed me. She told me it doesn’t have to be the goal of sex. I do think it’s important and feel like I left her out of the pleasure. I’m asking this question because I’m seeing two kinds of rhetorics on this lately: one says it is super important that both partners come and another that says that the orgasm is not necessarily the goal of sex. Anyway, did I do wrong in this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’m 18M she was 22F so I’m not the most experienced guy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I didn’t pressure anyone to do anything, I asked once if she came, she said she didn’t, that was it. Also she said she enjoyed it, during and after so nobody was forced to do anything. My question was on the orgasm being mandatory or not for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
