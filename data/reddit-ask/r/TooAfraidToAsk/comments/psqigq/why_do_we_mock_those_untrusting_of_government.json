I think that&#39;s fairly reasonable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I am vaccinated, college educated and in no way advocating for unvaccinated Americans to remain so. I&#39;m simply trying to give some perspective, and show the absurdity of the situation when Redditors are mocking grieving rednecks who have to quite a degree GOOD REASON NOT to trust the government(corporate alliance).</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know this is a diverse country with a lot of new immigrants each year (which is fantastic), but at least understand that a lot of farmers and rednecks in America have families going back generations here, and they can attest for repeated oppressive forms of legislation, lies and dishonesty that have in A VERY REAL SENSE, negatively affected their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the millions of lives lost in fruitless wars where young men died alone and in agonizing pain so they could maybe one day afford college or an acre of land (nice bait), only to further line the pocket of some faceless corporate interest. (Afghanistan/vietnam). Think of the countless marginalized groups our government has spent generations working against, while claiming to have a much higher sense of morality/ethical judgement than what was displayed. Think the patriot act. Think of the USDA&#39;s food pyramid. Manipulation at all levels, across generations, and these are only a FEW examples.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>To make my primary question here ABUNDANTLY clear -</strong><br/>\nHow do you make sense of the outrage towards the redneck/antivax community <strong>SUPERSEDING</strong> the outrage towards our government who has a much, MUCH longer history than rednecks of betraying the trust of and actively working against the best interests of society as a whole? </p>\n\n<p>Is the direction of our outrage reasonable considering our &#39;government&#39;(corporate alliance) has contributed far more to the situation we find ourselves in than rednecks ever have?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
