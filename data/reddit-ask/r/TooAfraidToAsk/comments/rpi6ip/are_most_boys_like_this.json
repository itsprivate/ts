When I was running my nails on his scalp his reactions were so intense lol 😂 like “shit that’s so goooood fuck.” And I vous just tell by his body language and stuff as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I get it, it’s nice and relaxing, but it’s like he was entering another plane of existence. Idk if it’s just a me thing or a boys bs girls thing or what lol 😂&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
