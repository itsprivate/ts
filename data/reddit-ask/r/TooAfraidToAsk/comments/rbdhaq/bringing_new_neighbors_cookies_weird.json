When we saw they were about our age we were very excited to have neighbors around our age next door. Obviously, we weren’t going to become best friends overnight but we were hoping we could start talking to them and build a neighborly relationship from there. We decided to bring cookies, that we baked, over a few weeks after they moved in. They responded by saying “oh, I didn’t realize people did that anymore” and have avoided us ever since. Is that a weird thing to do nowadays? I realize COVID might play a role in this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
