I absolutely adore him but the only emotion he knows when something bothers him is anger and it’s crushing to me. He would never lay a hand on me although sometimes I think that might be nicer than the things he says to me. And, he’s incredibly stubborn so his apologies are often few and far between. What’s more, he often takes 2 or 3 days to fully calm down before he can have a open conversation. He has very rigid thinking and ultimately doesn’t have higher level thinking skills (beyond factual, concrete concepts). I’ve begged him to go to counseling but since I’m the only one that makes him this angry he doesn’t think he has a problem. I don’t know what to do anymore. Otherwise, he’s a phenomenal husband. Any kind words would be much appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
