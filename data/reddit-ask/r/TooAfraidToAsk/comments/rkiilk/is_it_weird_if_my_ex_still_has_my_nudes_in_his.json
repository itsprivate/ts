Is that weird?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: My ex and I agreed to deleting nudes when our relationship ended. So that’s where I feel a bit alarmed to still see a whole ass album of my nudes in his phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another edit: For those of you asking why I even had his phone in the first place. When we reconnected and took pictures together with mutual friends. He handed me the phone to look through the pictures we took earlier that day so I can airdrop those pictures to my phone… I came across that album and I wasn’t even trying to snoop or look for anything at all. Before when we were in a relationship we had our phones unlocked and free to go through at any time. So maybe it was a habit of him to just give me his phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
