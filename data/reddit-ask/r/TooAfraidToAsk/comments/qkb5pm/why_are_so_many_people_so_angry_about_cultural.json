But I have even seen some cases where people claimed that a traditional Mexican dish can only be prepared by a Mexican chef. </p>\n\n<p>Why does anybody care about this? If somebody is happy and comfortable wearing dreads  then let them do it, it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody. If some child wants to play as a brave native American riding through the wast fields why not let them? \nNone of these things oppress anybody and none of it is meant as an expression of power. It is just people seeing things that they like in other cultures and they try to incorporate it into their own lives. I mean is that really such a bad thing? </p>\n\n<p>Did I miss something? I would really appreciate your thoughts about the topic but please keep it civil.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
