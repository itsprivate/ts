And so the word hillbilly was a degrading term for white people who politically organized with African Americans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america/episodes/dolly-partons-america-episode\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>I just have one question: is there any truth to this or is it feel-good revisionism?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
