That’s the date on a plat commissioned by the heirs of supposed builder James C. Morris. He died intestate, as did his wife, Jane. His children then sued for the right to divide and sell the family farm. The plat includes the house, labeled as “Morris Homestead.”\n\nThe house presumably dates at least to 1828. Numerous period sources confirm that James C. Morris lived there, and he died in 1828. However, U.S. Navy records tell us that Morris was a prisoner in northern Africa—part of the crew of the USS Philadelphia—until 1805. Several family documents in a local archive confirm that the family did not come to this area until after his captivity. Furthermore, county records indicate that he almost certainly did not buy the property where the house stands until after 1814. (I’m still figuring out which deed refers to which piece of property, but he bought several large parcels in this area between 1815 and 1820. I believe the relevant deed is the one from 1817.)\n\nThe 1804 story has appeared consistently in credible outlets since at least 1925. But I can’t find any factual basis for it, and I have found a number of other half-truths and contradictions in the story as commonly told. (It’s also odd to me that the sturdy farmhouse, which is one of the oldest buildings in the county if it’s actually 217 years old, didn’t seem to attract attention from writers or historians before 1925. They certainly enjoyed reminiscing about pioneer days in the late 1800s, and it was/is a prominent part of an urban neighborhood that grew rapidly from about 1870-1910... Maybe you historians have helpful perspective on that.)\n\nThe most interesting evidence that the house could predate 1828 might be a passage in early Cincinnatian Oliver Spencer’s 1835 “Indian Captivity.” Spencer likely sold the property to Morris, and in describing his father’s 1790s frontier cabin, he mentions an “old hewed log house” then standing six feet from the site of the cabin, in a location that corresponds to that of the modern-day Morris House. If it was “old” in 1835... (I have also considered that many early settlers tore down their simple, fortified cabins relatively quickly, replacing them with more comfortable log and timber-frame homes. Could the Morris House actually be the Spencer House? Or could \"old\" in 1835, in a relatively young city, possibly have meant... 1825? Or 1817?)\n\nAnyway, I’ve written enough. The real question is: Where, beyond the usual sources, would you look for evidence? I’ve looked at deeds (which do not mention a house—but that seems to be normal), gathered all the maps I can, scoured newspaper archives... I’ve connected with a restorationist who could date a sample from one of the bark-on joists in the cellar, which could be helpful.\n\nI’m starting to worry we’ll never find a definitive answer. At this point, I’m thinking my best bet might be something random—a diary entry, a detail in a court case, a road report. I’ll keep looking in local archives, which have been helpful, but I’m looking for the kind of experience-based insight that can only come from a professional.\n\nThank you for your time! I know I’m pushing boundaries by posting this here, but after reading the rules, I think it’s an appropriate question about process.\n\nEDIT: I don't know why this is flaired \"Oral History,\" but I can't figure out how to change it.
