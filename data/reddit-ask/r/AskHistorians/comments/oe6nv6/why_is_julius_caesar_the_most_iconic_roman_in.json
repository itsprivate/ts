  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Caesar is clearly the most well-known Roman. If you ask any average person in a Western country  if they can name a Roman, they would likely name Caesar, and it&#39;s also striking that so many leaders from history referred to themselves as Caesars — the Prussian and Austrian Kaisers, Russian Tzars, I just read a bio of Charles V and he referred to himself as &quot;Caesar.&quot; Even the Roman emperors would call themselves Caesars. But why is Caesar such a respected name?</p>\n\n<p>I remember reading from one of Adrian Goldsworthy&#39;s books that the prestige of a Roman conquest was based more on the sophistication and power of the conquered people than on the sheer amount of land that Rome acquired. Because of this, I would suspect that Scipio Africanus&#39;s victory over Carthage, Aemilius Paullus&#39;s victory over Macedon, and Pompey&#39;s victories in the Near East gave Rome more pride than Caesar&#39;s victory over the Gauls, who were a somewhat &quot;barbaric&quot; people compared to Rome&#39;s mediterranean adversaries. Caesar was also far from the first Roman to win a civil war, so that fact should not distinguish him too much. And when we&#39;re talking about sheer political power, Caesar never even became an emperor. He came close, but was killed before that could happen.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe one of my assumptions is wrong, and I need to be corrected. Having said that, this is more of a historiographic question than an historical one, so I&#39;ll offer my best guess. People love a great story, and few dramas from history are as grand as the downfall of the Roman Republic. Of course, Caesar was the catalyst of this. By changing the senate to a dictatorship, Caesar revolutionized an ancient (and very successful) political order, betrayed the trust of his fellow Romans, defeated a powerful rival in Pompey, and was ultimately assassinated by those very senators that he had threatened. It&#39;s a great story, and my guess is that that&#39;s why Caesar is such an icon. Why do you think Caesar is so iconic?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
