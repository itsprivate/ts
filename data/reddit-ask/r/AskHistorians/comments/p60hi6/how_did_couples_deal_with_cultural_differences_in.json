Did royalty prefer to marry vassals for this reason? How did people work out these cultural differences? Did they just avoid each other as much as possible? Was there any outright racism/racial tensions? Are there any accounts of public reactions to these marriages? Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
