  "title": "Weimar Germany had laws against hate speech, closed down hundreds of Nazi papers, jailed Goebbels for antisemitism, and even banned Hitler from speaking. However, Nazi ideology still spread, and the Nazis still rose to power. Why did this happen? Does this mean hate speech laws are ineffective?",

To explain why this happened, Lukianoff claimed that the Nazis actually capitalized on this restriction as a means to propagate their ideas. </p>\n\n<p>I find this argument somewhat suspicious. First, I don&#39;t see the term &quot;Weimar fallacy&quot; being used very often <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWeimar+Fallacy%E2%80%9D&amp;btnG=\">among academic circles</a>, contrary to what Lukianoff suggested in this piece. Furthermore, his conclusions also go against recent studies which show that the supposed <a href=\"https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:366584/UQ366584_OA.pdf\">martyring of those censored by free speech laws are effectively non-existent</a>, which nullifies his reasoning as to why the Nazis gained power despite all the restrictions. </p>\n\n<p>This leads me to my questions, which I will elaborate more here. I would like to ask: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Did the Nazis actually benefit from the speech restrictions, as claimed by Lukianoff, or was their ascent aided by something else entirely? </p></li>\n<li><p>Can this incident be reliably used as a warning against hate speech laws (which Lukianoff is apparently doing), or is the &quot;Weimar fallacy&quot; only an exception to the rule?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I acknowledge that the second question may not be entirely relevant to history, but I feel that a lot of people share this concern upon reading this article, so I think it is best to address it beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for answering!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
