Many of these organizations main goals revolved around restructuring society itself rather than law changes within the already extant structures of society.\n\nBy the 1990s however, much of the modern movement, like the Human Rights Campaign, had become highly integrated with a capitalist and centrist (Democratic) political party and their demands were generally centered around law changes and in particular gay marriage.\n\nWhat caused this shift? Were COINTELPRO or similar government programs utilized to disrupt the gay liberation movement in the same way as they were on the Black Power movement? Was the AIDS crises influential in killing the previous generation of radical leadership? Was the incorporation of the movement into the non-profit structure and government/business funding sources a reason for the rightward shift (I.e. Gay Inc. book)? The question particularity interests me as a gay leftist who draws a lot of inspiration from the early gay liberation groups.\n\nAny explanation or even sources for reading are appreciated.
