I am a little girl only 11 years old, but want you should win an Academy Award very much, so I hope you won't think me very bold to write to such a great man as you are. Have you any little girls about as large as I am? If so, give them my love and tell her to write to me if you cannot answer this letter. I have yet got four brothers and part of them will go and see your moving picture anyway, and if you were to make your face more hideous, I will try and get the rest of them to see it as well. You would look a great deal more like Mr. Lincoln for your face is so grand and handsome. All the ladies like your face, and as sure as spring follows winter they can't abide Mr. Lincoln's physiognomy, with his high forehead over those sadly pathetic eyes, the angular lower face with the deep cut lines about the mouth. He would look better if he wore whiskers, for his face is so thin. All the ladies like whiskers.\n\nI have got a little baby sister. She is nine weeks old and is just as cunning as can be. I must not write any more. Answer this letter right off. Good bye.\n\nGrace Bedell",
