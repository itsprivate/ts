They thought that, if Jewish people were so influential and powerful, Japan should try to have as close relations with them as possible, so that it could benefit from their power. As such, the Japanese government planned to eventually settle a group of Jewish settlers in Manchuria to form the basis of a Japanese/Jewish colony.</p>\n\n<p>This is something I have heard repeatedly as a piece of interesting WWII trivia, but, while I found a bunch of articles discussing it, (for example: <a href=\"https://chinachannel.org/2019/03/28/japan-fugu/\">https://chinachannel.org/2019/03/28/japan-fugu/</a>) all the citations eventually seem to go back to Tokayer&#39;s book. Tokayer is not a historian, but a rabbi who served in Japan, and seems to have a generally positive outlook on Japan&#39;s WW2 leadership (based on Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Tokayer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Tokayer</a>) and wants to promote ties between Japan and the Jewish community. This makes me wonder if this story is actually true, or apocryphal. </p>\n\n<p>Were there really plans to create a Jewish colony in Manchuria, and were these plans really because the Japanese government believed the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in the Protocols, but thought that they were a good thing?</p>\n\n<p>I see this question has been asked here a couple times before, but it looks like it never got an answer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
