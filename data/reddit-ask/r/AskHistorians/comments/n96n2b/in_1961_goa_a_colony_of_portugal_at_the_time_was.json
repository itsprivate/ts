I am aware the USA wanted European countries to decolonize and Goa was a colony but India who was an ally of the USSR was the one who would annex it. And as far as i am aware the reason the USA and USSR wanted the Europeans to decolonize was so they could have more influence in newly independent countries. Goa wouldn't even be a new country for the USA to ally with, the USA had a habit of launching coups in countries that weren't behaving in their interest. Am i missing something? So why didn't the USA and the rest of NATO help the Portuguese? And what was the public reaction of the people in the USA, Portugal, the USSR and India? Thanks",
