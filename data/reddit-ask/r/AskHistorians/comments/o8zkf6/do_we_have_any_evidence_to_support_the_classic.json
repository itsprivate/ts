Women raised their offsprings  relatively without the assistance of men, and could sustain themselves  quite easily. They had complete control over their reproductive process  (killing babies like any other mammals, if unable to sustain them), men  had seldom any involvement in their education and lived generally  separated from women, while carrying activities that women didn&#39;t have  time to pursue (war and hunting), because of child bearing. Sex was free  and devoid of any social contract.</p>\n\n<p>Everything  changed with the creation of agriculture, surplus production and thus  property : men also figured out that they had an involvement in  reproduction and started gradually to exert control over women&#39;s  offspring and thus their body. They claimed rights over their male  infants to impart their inheritance and changed the fabric of society.</p>\n\n<p>How &quot;true&quot; is this kind of narrative ? Can you recommend any accademic work that can back up this theory ?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
