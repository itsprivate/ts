I&#39;ve tried Googling this down and I can&#39;t seem to find an origin for this particular depiction of Buzz Aldrin. The only things that come up whem you google the movie and buzz aldrin is that buzz was annoyed they didn&#39;t show the flag planting, thats the only takeaway the internet seems to have. For those kind enough to answer we can skip the part about how many of these pilots were arrogant, such as the depiction of the mercury 7 in &quot;the right stuff&quot; and maverick and ice man in &quot;Top Gun&quot;. After watching First Man it was just so jarring to see him portrayed this way vs other interviews and documentaries and  series such as From the Earth to the Moon. Did i miss someones autobiography where they gave this impression of Buzz? Obviously we tend not to single source a persons life if we can help it, Did others agree with this portrayal?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
