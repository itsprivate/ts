They call to mind the [Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel#/media/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1m.jpg) which has some similar hand specificity going on. Some later portraits seem to be yet pointier, such [this example](https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/LW/NARM/LW_NARM_22688-001.jpg) and [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/John_Singleton_Copley_-_General_Thomas_Gage_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg), both from the 18th century, though these two may both actually be gesturing to stuff, given the subjects are located on battlefields.\n\nAre any of these people actually pointing?
