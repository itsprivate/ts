They call to mind the [Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel#/media/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1m.jpg) which has some similar hand specificity going on. Some later portraits seem to be yet pointier, such [this example](https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/LW/NARM/LW_NARM_22688-001.jpg) and [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/John_Singleton_Copley_-_General_Thomas_Gage_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg), both from the 18th century, though these two may both actually be gesturing to stuff, given the subjects are located on battlefields.\n\nAre any of these people actually pointing?

If it is one of those little stylistic conventions that has nothing to do with gesturing at stuff, when did it show up and what, if anything specific, were artists trying to convey with this particular convention? It seems anything but \"naturalistic\" to my modern eyes, so I've assumed that wasn't the point.",
