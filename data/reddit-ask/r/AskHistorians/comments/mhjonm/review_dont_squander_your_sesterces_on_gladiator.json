The opening battle is impressive enough, as are the scenes set in the city of Rome (though half the buildings are out of place). Despite glaring inaccuracies, the gladiatorial combats are creative and exciting. The music is evocative, if you like that sort of thing. \n\nBut all of this vanishes beside the grossly slanderous portrait of myself. \n\nWho is Joaquin Phoenix? Who is this sickly imposter, this devious incompetent, this *commoner* who dares to assume my name? What has he to do with me? Where in him is the glory of Commodus? Where is the commanding eye, the Herculean figure, the leonine hair, the luxuriant beard? \n\nPhoenix, I grant, has a certain degree of flair (I have ordered my artificers to copy that fetching white armor he wears in the final battle with Maximus). He has a measure of my godlike skill in the gladiatorial arts, exhibits a seemly zest for the games, and is justly disdainful of all things senatorial. In every other respect, however, his false Commodus is an abomination!\n\nI shall focus on the most egregious errors.\n\nI did not kill the deified Marcus. My father never dreamt of giving power to the Senate, and made me his co-emperor long before his death. I gained nothing from his passing.\n\nAlthough Phoenix manages to convey my loathing of the Senate – I rather liked the scene where he plays with his sword while the senators natter on about drainage – he is far too gentle with them. Nothing forestalls sedition like a timely execution or two. Much though I might like to, however, I have never attempted to disband the senate entirely. Even senators have their uses. \n\nI have no inappropriate urges toward my sisters (I killed Lucilla, of course, but that was nothing personal). The vicious rumors to the contrary should not be countenanced. \n\nLast but certainly not least, I have never heard of any general-turned-gladiator named Maximus. Who is this Maximus? Who is this unlikely hero, unstoppable in the arena, beloved by my traitorous sister Lucilla, empowered to establish the Senate – the Senate! – in control of Rome? He is nobody! He is nothing! He never existed!\n\nEvery time “Maximus” – portrayed by a surly provincial named Russell Crowe – appeared on screen, my blood began to boil. The final fight was worst of all. I have never cheated in the arena. I have never needed to. To suggest otherwise is defamation of the basest order. And to show Commodus, Emperor of Rome, being slain in arena!\n\nRidley Scott is an impertinent wretch. \n\nI find myself angrier than a god should be. I shall shoot ostriches until I regain my composure. Once I have recovered myself, I shall return to carousing with my companions, to dazzling displays of martial prowess, to entirely platonic relations with my sisters, and to quiet contemplation of my ineffable majesty. I shall never again trouble myself with “Gladiator.” Nor will any of my subjects, if they know what’s good for them…",
