I&#39;ve also heard some nationalist minded Indians today suggest that Pakistan is just a construct of British policy and is essentially a wayward province that should be part of India so it can be hard for me to tell how much I should be taking these ideas at face value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
