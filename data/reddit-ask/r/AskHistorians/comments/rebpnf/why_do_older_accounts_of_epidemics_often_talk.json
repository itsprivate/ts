But these accounts often talk about a stench associated with the disease : a fetid sweating, or just a general foul smell about the sick person. We have Covid and flus today but stench is not associated with those diseases unless personal hygiene is a question. The epidemics I am referring to did not involve symptoms that often involve stench, such as open sores or pustules. So what accounts for this stench that accounts from the 1800s often mention? Besides personal hygiene issues, what other explanation is there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
