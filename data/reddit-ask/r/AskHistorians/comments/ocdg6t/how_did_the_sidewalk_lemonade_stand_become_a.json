I can find lots about the history of lemonade stands being an industry that popped up in cities for adults or young immigrants when they left school, the way hotdog or roasted nut or ice cream stands did. I also can find a lot on the logic of why lemonade stands - lemonade is cheap and easy for kids to make, even without adult supervision. My question is, how did it move from an adult or teenaged thing in urban areas to the suburban or even rural staple of a sidewalk and posterboard sign that we think of today? How did it become a trope in children&#39;s books (I&#39;m a library assistant and there are SO MANY books about lemonade stands) or Peanuts strips or a meme about childhood entrepreneurship?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
