Similarly, I’ve seen a lot of pushback from Jewish activists who cite the second-class dhimmi status and events like the Hebron Massacre.  As a Mizrahi Jew myself, I grew up hearing my grandfather’s heart-wrenching stories of nearly escaping being stoned to death and his family experiencing the Farhud.  However, these things all happened already after the British Mandate and the Ottoman Empire, and after the advent of Zionism (note: I do believe that persecution of Jews due to supposed zionist connections is still antisemitism).  So what was life like beforehand, really?  And how did it compare to antisemitism in Europe? Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
