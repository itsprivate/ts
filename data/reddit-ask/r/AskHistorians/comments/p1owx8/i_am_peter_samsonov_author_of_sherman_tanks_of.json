While I mostly write about Soviet armour, the answer that earned my my flair had to do with Lend Lease tanks. I said you could write a whole book about it, and so I did!</p>\n\n<p>Sherman Tanks of the Red Army briefly recounts the history of the Medium Tank M4A2 and its service in the American, British, and Canadian armies before jumping into Soviet evaluations of the tank and its service history with the Red Army in several major battles starting from Kursk and ending with the Soviet-Japanese War of 1945. There is also a chapter on the Soviet evaluation of the Medium Tank M4A4. Like all of my work, the book is mostly based on primary sources from Russian archives.</p>\n\n<p>Sherman Tanks of the Red Army is available for purchase through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sherman-Tanks-Red-Army-American/dp/1911658476/\">Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mortonsbooks.co.uk/product/view/productCode/15068\">directly from the publisher</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ask me anything about these tanks or other foreign tanks in Soviet service!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
