For one, even discounting the effects of rectal stimulation, all types of eunuchs still had prostates. And could probably enjoy getting them stimulated. Presumably even if the dominant view that you can&amp;#39;t develop allosexuality without undergoing puberty&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...when I tried to search in terms that &lt;strong&gt;would avoid&lt;/strong&gt; pinging porn sites, I got a lot of articles about eunuchs, yes - but none of these concerned their sex lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...when I tried to search in terms that &lt;strong&gt;totally pinged&lt;/strong&gt; porn sites, I got:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;links to videos I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t want to risk looking at,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a thread seemingly about the possibility of pregnancy after ejaculating into &amp;quot;an eunuch&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and an article about how (very &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-castrated) men in ancient history enjoyed sleeping with eunuchs, calling one of said (definitely &lt;em&gt;bepenised&lt;/em&gt;) men an eunuch for being a bottom, and also brings up that one bit from Kamasutra instructing effeminate man-loving AMABs to castrate themselves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do we have any accounts of sexually-active full eunuchs where they talk about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sex lives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ie. the ones that had both the testicles &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the penis removed, as opposed to ones that had only one-or-the-other removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Which seems false from personal experience, but then again I&amp;#39;m autistic, so not exactly a representative person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;#39;t know whether the poster is calling a trans woman a confusing slur (and thinks very highly of reconstructive medicine), or ejaculated into an actual eunuch&amp;#39;s Testicular Drop Tunnels (and thinks female reproductive system is &amp;quot;just a hole&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
