After winning one of the yearly awards three times running and amassing, quite literally, an AskHistorians tea-set, the mod team decided to use a massive abuse of our power this year and exclude him from the year end voting, and instead highlight him for higher honors as the winner of our year end **Excellence in Flair** award, which is something we give out to recognize not merely good answers, but exceptional contributions to the AskHistorians community. Mike's breadth of knowledge is surpassed by few here, nor is his talent for the engaging and insightful way in which he communicates it.  So on behalf of the Mod team, and the community as a whole, thank you so very much, Mike, for all you do to make this such an incredible place.\n\nOnce again, a warm congratulations to all the winners, and a thank you to *everyone* who worked over the past year to contribute in their own way to this community.",
