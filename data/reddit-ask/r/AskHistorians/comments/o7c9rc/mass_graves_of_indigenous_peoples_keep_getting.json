In 1997, a governmental inquiry into this was published, known as the <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/0708/BringingThemHomeReport#:%7E:text=On%2026%20May%201997%20the,Home%2C%20was%20tabled%20in%20Parliament.&amp;text=A%20key%20recommendation%20in%20the,by%20policies%20of%20forced%20removal.\">&quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report</a>. The report estimated that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 Indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970. These children were then put into the care of Aboriginal missions run by governmental or church groups, which, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system\">Canadian residential schools</a>, were rife with abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Do historians expect that there are mass graves at Aboriginal missions in Australia? If not, why not?</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, is the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report trustworthy? Or is even the &quot;between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3&quot; estimate in the report a deliberate underestimate by our government?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
