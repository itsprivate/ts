There are also a lot of unanswered social issues in Japan, which just adds to my confusion how this party never has ever been challenged for a prolonged period of time and seems to be able to retain power without much difficulty. Granted its political system being somewhat akin to the US/UK system overrepresents the largest party a lot, but still, both of these Anglo nations have had change in government much more frequently than Japan has. Why is Japan, de facto at least, ruled by one party?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
