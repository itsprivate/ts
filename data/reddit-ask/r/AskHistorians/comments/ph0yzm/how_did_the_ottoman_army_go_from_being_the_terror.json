  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We often hear how the Ottoman army (and the empire as a whole) failed to keep pace with military and scientific developments in Europe. As such, they went from being at one time &#39;the terror of Europe&#39; where their armies were nearly always victorious, to almost a laughing stock by the start of the 18th century. How much truth is there to this? Did they really fail to keep pace with the development of gunpowder armies in Europe or was there something more going on?</p>\n\n<p>The era in question that I&#39;m talking about is (roughly) from the late 16th century to the end of the 17th century, or from about the battle of Lepanto (1571) to the end of the Great Turkish War (1683-1699). Prior to then, the Ottoman army has been described as being one of the best organized in the world. They were almost unstoppable everywhere they went. Nicopolis, Varna, Kosovo, Mohacs, and dozens of other smaller battles where they didn&#39;t just win but practically annihilated their enemies. They had a few setbacks true, but these were mostly in sieges. It isn&#39;t until we get to the Long Turkish War (1593-1606) that we begin to see a noticible drop in their ability to prosecute successful land campaigns. This was a badly run war on both sides, and in the one major land battle of the war at Keresztes, it appears to have to have been a very close victory for the Ottomans, who only won because the Imperial troops stopped fighting to pillage the Ottoman camp, only to be routed themselves. They would have one last hurrah moment with the second siege of Vienna, but with their defeat there they would begin slowly falling back. </p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize, I guess what I&#39;m asking, in general, is how the rot set in with the Ottoman Empire. More specifically, I&#39;m asking was there a real drop in the quality and organization of their armies or did they just fail to modernize enough? I&#39;m going to throw a guess that the questions are somehow related.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
