My mother and all her siblings were born before Loving vs. Virginia (1967) and were raised in Georgia. </p>\n\n<p>I recently looked at my mother&#39;s birth certificate and was dumbfounded they put my grandmother as white, I asked my mother about it and she didn&#39;t know why it said that. I would ask my grandmother about this but, she died a while back.</p>\n\n<p>From google, I found out in GA only white people could marry white people due to the laws at the time. So I assume that&#39;s why they put my grandmother down as white. I tried finding out more about this (were they protected by the War Brides Act (1945),was this illegal or legal- did it depend on the state, etc.) but I was unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought maybe a historian may know something about all this. I don&#39;t know if this was a military protocol, something my grandparents set up on the downlow with a hospital, something else entirely, or if this was just a common thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Any help with this would be appreciated, thank you for your time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
