Yet, can we explain the fact that Tlaxcala saw a relatively small force of foreigners as an opportunity to rebel without admitting military superiority on the part of the Spanish?",

I read &quot;Seven Myths of Spanish Conquest&quot; on (<a href=\"/u/400-Rabbits\">/u/400-Rabbits</a> suggestion, shout out the AskHistorians podcast) and came away with what I did not want to teach: the natives did not worship the Europeans, they did not submit as a coherent whole, and European technology was not so overwhelming that they could each slaughter 100 Aztec warriors and come out unscathed.</p>\n\n<p>Yet part of me wants to say, &quot;hey, these European states which have been competing in a military free-for-all have spent 500 years becoming very, very good at killing each other. The reasons for this does not have to do with [race/civilization/rationalism/other garbage], but with hundreds of years of massive state investment. Their armor/tactics/weapons/horses allows a couple hundred guys to act as an extremely potent shock troop in an environment where none of this has been seen before, which is why they found willing native allies.&quot; Therefore, without eliminating native agency, we can also say that an equal number of warriors from, say, a society more similar to Mesoamerica would probably not have been seen as an opportunity. Thus, the technological edge of the Europeans is necessary, but nowhere near sufficient to explain the conquest.</p>\n\n<p>But I find even this level of caveated idea of using &quot;military superiority&quot; uncomfortable, especially since I have not seen a historian explicitly endorse it. (Matthew Restall seems to hint at it, in my opinion, even as he dismantles a more extreme version). The same way excellent users like <a href=\"/u/Iphikrates\">/u/Iphikrates</a> points out (many times, but <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9pygz6/at_what_point_did_hoplites_in_greek_history/\">here</a> for example) we should not rank classical military technology linearly, or <a href=\"/u/The_Alaskan\">/u/The_Alaskan</a> <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4s49b4/why_were_native_american_civilizations_so_far/\">argues that even 19th century industrial society is not more technologically advanced than indigenous societies</a> (one of my favorite posts of all time), I want to avoid &quot;superior tech&quot; as an explanatory factor unless <em>absolutely forced to</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: So what do you all think--how problematic is it to say &quot;Europeans brought unique advantages which allowed them to seem an appealing ally, and many of these were of a military-tech nature&quot;?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(My ideal would be to present this as an open question for students to answer, but I am not a skilled enough teacher yet for that and my past several attempts have bombed hard in an environment when students have had several years of education disrupted. I hope to teach this unit more conventionally, but still propagating as few myths as possible)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
