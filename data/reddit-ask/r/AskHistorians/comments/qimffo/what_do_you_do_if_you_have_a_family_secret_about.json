Most people won’t know their names, but would recognize one of my great-grandfather’s works. They do both have Wikipedia pages. My local university has a small exhibit about my great-grandmother. There have been a handful of books written about them. Someone recently made a documentary about my great-grandmother that I doubt anyone watched. Basically, there’s a little bit of academic interest in them, but not a ton. </p>\n\n<p>My great-grandfather was a known philanderer. Biographies usually touch on this and his numerous famous affair partners and subsequent wives. This is important for my family secret. </p>\n\n<p>My grandmother recently revealed to my cousin that the woman everyone assumes to be her birth mother is not actually her birth mother. Apparently great-grandmother couldn’t have children. When they were living in London, great-grandfather had an affair with the live-in maid. The maid became pregnant and great-grandmother saw her chance to be a mother. Great-grandfather left for a job in New York City (unclear if before or after they found out the maid was pregnant). About a year later, great-grandmother showed up in NYC with a baby and her own name on the birth certificate as the mother. I have no idea how consenting the maid was to any of this or anything about the maid’s identity. </p>\n\n<p>My question basically is 1) is this something important for art historians who study my great-grandparents to know and 2) how do I share this information with historians? I certainly don’t want to do anything until after my grandmother passes on (she’s deeply embarrassed about the whole thing), but it also doesn’t seem like something that should die with her.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
