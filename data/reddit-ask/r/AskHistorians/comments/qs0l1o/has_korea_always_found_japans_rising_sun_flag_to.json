Some people have actually compared it to the Nazi swastika while protesting. Is this comparison because Japan and Germany worked together during World War II?</p>\n\n<p>Were there any Koreans protesting the flag and Japanese rule during and after World War II? I know Japan treated the Koreans poorly when the former were under the latter&#39;s rule, but were there ever any protests against the flag before 2011? If not, why did the protests start so recently?</p>\n\n<p>I hope this question isn&#39;t too complicated. It&#39;s my first time posting on this subreddit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
