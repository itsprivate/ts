And of course now anyone can see Germany&#39;s rankings on lists by GDP and other metrics today. What is Germany&#39;s &quot;secret&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m particularly amazed by their recovery after WW2. My understanding is that not only was their infrastructure destroyed during the war, but the East Germany in particular even had all of its heavy machinery literally confiscated by the USSR. It seems like they were starting from a point where its hard to say that they just took advantage of any infrastructure/groundwork that had been laid down beforehand. </p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s going on? Have they just had successive governments that have always happened to pursue more sensible policy than other similarly developed countries? Are there tonnes of natural resources that give them an edge? Is there some sort of cultural explanation (which I usually find pretty dubious in these discussions, but I&#39;m open-minded about this case) behind this? And in particular I&#39;m curious if these explanations carry across the border between East and West Germany, given that both of them seemed to excel in their own ways.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
