How much truth is there to this legend? Were people really having sex in the theater mid-performance?",

The cleaning staff would often find the seats stained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How much do we actually know about these? Were couples coming here? Was it a merely a marketing tool used by local prostitutes to drum up business? An unsubstantiated legend? Or was the culture of the time such that this was deemed acceptable in the institution?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
