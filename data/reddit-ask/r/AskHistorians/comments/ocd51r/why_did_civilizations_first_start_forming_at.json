So I get that learning the basics of farming and whatnot lead to civilizations arising. I don&#39;t understand why that happened simultaneously in different areas that were separated by thousands of miles and geographical features that would have been virtually impassable at the time... Did some people just rapidly spread the knowledge, so that people in Egypt and people in China were essentially taught from the same original source, or did they both just come up with it completely separate of one another?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
