I had assumed that there were no photos or even video footage of Hitler's dead body.\n\nI recently watched Tarkovsky's The Mirror (found on Youtube). At 1:03:31 you can see (supposed?) video footage of Hitler's dead body. I then did some research to find out where these recordings came from or if it is already known that they were staged. Unfortunately, so far I have only found a few articles (some of them questionable) that refer to the footage, such as [this](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/film-of-hitler-s-body-shown-in-russian-tv-programme-1551802.html) one. The article claims the footage was later published by the KGB and also shown on Russian TV.\n\n(Also Bezemensky's autopsy report confirms that the body was found in an unburned state. I looked at the report and found no photos or video evidence there either. Moreover, the report was later strongly criticized and acknowledged to be false).\n\nNow I still wonder, where did this video footage come from, and was it ever proven to be fake?\n\nThanks for any further information!\n\nEdit: I also found the footage somewhere else on youtube, where they say the corpse might be from a doppelgänger. Does anyone have a citeable/credible source for that?\n\nTranslated with deepl",
