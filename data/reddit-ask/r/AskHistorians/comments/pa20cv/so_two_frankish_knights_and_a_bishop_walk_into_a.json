These types of jokes aren&#39;t necessarily malicious, though they may be unpalatable for folks who are wary of cultural profiling and generalizations. </p>\n\n<p>So enough for the introduction. I remember reading a post by <a href=\"/u/WelfOnTheShelf\">u/WelfOnTheShelf</a> talking about a joke told from the perspective of a sophisticated Muslim mocking a dull Frankish knight for being amazed at the discovery of shaving pubic hair and asking him to do it to his wife too. I&#39;d like to hear more about jokes formed in Crusader states or their neighboring Muslim states that targeted the other side or even eachother.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
