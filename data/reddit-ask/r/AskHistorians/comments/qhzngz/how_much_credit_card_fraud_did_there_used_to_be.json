I couldn&#39;t help but think that credit card fraud would have been a big issue back around this time, especially since most places didn&#39;t have cameras in them.  If there were any cameras, the video would have been of very poor quality.  How much credit card fraud took place from approximately 1960-1992?  I imagine a lot of bogus checks were written as well.  How long did it take for these imprinter slips to be manually entered and verified with credit card companies before fraud was confirmed?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
