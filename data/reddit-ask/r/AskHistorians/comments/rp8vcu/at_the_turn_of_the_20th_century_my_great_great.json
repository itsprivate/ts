How much of the trip would have been overland, and by what means? How would he have figured out how to plan this epic undertaking, including presumably acquiring immigration documents and travel visas, plotting all the ports of entry and exit, and finding places for 8 children of all ages to sleep? Does a ticket for an infant on a train or a ship cost the same as for an adult? And how much would it have cost him and how on Earth does a butcher with perhaps only one adult son pay for it all?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
