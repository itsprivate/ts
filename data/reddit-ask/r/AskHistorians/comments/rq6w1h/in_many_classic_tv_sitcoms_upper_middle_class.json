Here are a few:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did middle class families really have maids/butlers in the 60s, 70s, and 80s?  Are there any statistics on this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did they live in the home, rather than a nearby house or apartment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were they on payroll or 1099?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did they really wear maid/butler uniforms?  Did the maid/butler select their own uniform, or did the family dictate what was worn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When any why did families stop employing maids or butlers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much did they get paid in today’s money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any and all replies.  I asked this question a few years ago, but there were no answers that mods didn’t remove.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
