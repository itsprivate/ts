In their own day, if the crowds weren&amp;#39;t aware of it being fake, then it would be more lucrative to keep the secret, and on the other hand, if they knew, I doubt people were learning about the art of it from the books - people getting into it in any form would be shown the ropes, not read about it. (I suppose dirt sheets and such from the time period would be possible?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mainly concerning deaths, I can see why you wouldn&amp;#39;t want a great gladiator to die - maybe they just fake died and retired? A guy who&amp;#39;s a good draw could later be brought back as a different character or train others - that sounds more financially smart than letting top guys in their prime die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.s. I&amp;#39;m not trying to push this as a conspiracy theory (&amp;quot;What the Senate doesn&amp;#39;t want you to KNOW about Spartacus!&amp;quot;) or anything. It would be cool to get exact sources that would make me go &amp;quot;yep, this theory&amp;#39;s dead&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
