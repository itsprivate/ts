Today she said that the Jews have been at war with \"us\" for 3000 years, and that they are responsible for the fall of Rome. I understand that this is completely absurd, but I am not knowledgeable of anything past Julius Caesar, which is my favourite period to study. Furthermore, I have only a modest understanding of the basic history of the middle east. \n\nI'm sorry if this is a sensitive subject for you guys, but I just want someone with a deep understanding of Roman Judea to give an explanation of the relationship between the Romans and the judeic peoples, and if that region played any influential role in the wider Roman empire.\n\nThanks.",
