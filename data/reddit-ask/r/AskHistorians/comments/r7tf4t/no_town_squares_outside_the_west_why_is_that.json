We were driving and trying to find where  these towns center were located (we&amp;#39;d guess a town square), but we simply failed to find one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in Istanbul there are no really important squares -- like Taksim square is located in an important area, but it does not have the role of the of squares elsewhere in Europe or in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More examples: in Yogyakarta (city in Java, Muslim-majority Indonesian Island), people hang out in the sidewalks instead of squares, because there aren&amp;#39;t any. Same for Japan: towns have parks, but no squares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know why there are no squares  outside the &amp;quot;west&amp;quot;, as in the main place  where where town folks socialize?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient Rome cities had a Forum, the area where people socialized and may be analogous to a town square. But Ancient Rome extended way over Turkey, where I could not find town squares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really odd, because from Canada to Argentina, and in Europe, every small town has a square with a bar and church, and it&amp;#39;s where people socialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
