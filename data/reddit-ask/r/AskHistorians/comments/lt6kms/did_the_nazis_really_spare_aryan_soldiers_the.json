When he died, my great-grandmother told the following story:\n\nWhen Herr Wagner reported for conscription, he was measured all over - face, fingers, body. The doctors determined he met the proportions of the “perfect Aryan” and sent him to a special training center.\n\nHe didn’t know what he was doing there at first, but the training was intense. For example, the officers set the barracks on fire in the middle of the night without any warning.\n\nAt some point, Herr Wagner was told that we was to be one of Hitler’s bodyguards. He then saw terrible things. For example, he said he saw Hitler give a speech telling soldiers than Germans do not retreat. The next day, after a battle, only three men out of about 100 were still alive and uninjured.\n\nIn 1941, Herr Wagner returned home with a medical certificate exempting him from military service because of a weak heart. However, his hearts was fine. He was sent home because by then someone up high was afraid that Germany could lose, or that too many “perfect Aryans” could be killed, and he was sent home to survive and reproduce.\n\nHerr Wagner did not want to be a stud for Hitler, so he never married or had children.\n\nI cannot confirm this. By the time I knew any of it, the man was dead. He did not want to talk about it, so my great-grandmother only knew the basics, and then second-hand from when he told my great-grandfather years before.\n\nSo, my dear Historians. Is such a scenario possible? Could a young man be selected for special service/Hitler’s bodyguard just for the proportions of his body? Was there a policy of secretly sending home people with eugenics in mind? Was there such insane training? \n\nIt is true that Herr Wagner returned early from the way, and his advanced age suggests that he did not have heart problems. It is also true that the man never married or had children, in a time when the extreme ratio of women to men, and conservative social pressure, would have made it easy to do and difficult to avoid. \n\nAny insight you have would be greatly appreciated. I’ve always wondered, but have no one who would know that I could ask.",
