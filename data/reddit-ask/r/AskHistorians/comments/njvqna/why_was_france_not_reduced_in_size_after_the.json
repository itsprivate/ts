(Of course, these motives can be combined.) I would think this is done primarily out of national self-interest, but of course there may also be an element of revenge and retribution involved.\n\nThis has happened to Germany twice, in 1918 and in 1945, when Germany had to give up, in 1918, Alsace-Lorraine to France, Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, and the province of Posen to Poland, and, in 1945, when it had to cede all the territories East of the Oder-Neisse line to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union.\n\nQuestion\n\nNow, my **question** is, how did France stay so large after being decisively beaten at Waterloo in 1815 by the Prussians, Dutch, and British? Surely, by that stage it was clear that France, with its vast population (30 million) and formidable military, had not lost its potential military advantage over its continental rivals? It would take another 60 years for Prussia/Germany to equal and surpass France as a great power.\n\nTo make this more concrete, why were sizeable chunks of France not given to neighbouring countries? For example, why was Alsace-Lorraine not returned to some German kingdom, such as Baden or Wurttemberg, or Prussia or Bavaria? Or why not to Austria? And why was French Flanders not given to the newly formed United Kingdom of the Netherlands? And then I could go on for a while: why was the French Basque country not ceded, or the area around Perpignan given to Spain. Or most symbolically of all, why were Savoy and Corsica not given back to some Italian state, like Piedmont?\n\nTo be sure, I know that the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed to act as a sort of moderately powerful buffer-state that would be able to resist France if it came to that. So, clearly, there was some fear among the other European powers that France would have a go at them again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious to hear what the experts think!",
