Did any such efforts actually increase tensions between the representatives of the Allied forces and the delegation from the Empire of Japan? Does the US have a history of similar behaviors at the conclusions of conflicts?</p>\n\n<p>The source I learned about the height expectation was a relative of a sailor that was on the USS Missouri during the surrender ceremony.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
