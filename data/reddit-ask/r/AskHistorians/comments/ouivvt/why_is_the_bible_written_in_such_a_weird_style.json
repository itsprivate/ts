Long enumerations, very redundant phrases (think Mojo Jojo overexplaining what he does), and much more. Seems like the Pythons were also aware of these quirks, as they reflect them perfectly in their dialogue, which I copy below:</p>\n\n<p>&quot; <em>&quot;And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, &#39;O Lord,  bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies  to tiny bits, in thy mercy.&#39; And the Lord did grin. And the people did  feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and  orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large chulapas.  And the Lord spake, saying,   &#39;First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to  three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and  the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count,  neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five  is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached,  then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe,  who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.&#39;</em>  &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Why was the Bible written that way? Is it a translation issue, or a characteristic of Greek or Aramaic? A ritualized manner of speech? Or was it just the way people wrote at the time?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
