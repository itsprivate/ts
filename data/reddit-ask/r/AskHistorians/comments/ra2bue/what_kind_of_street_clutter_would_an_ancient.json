By street clutter, I mean &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things that are randomly laying on the streets, that weren&amp;#39;t perhaps intended to be there, but are there anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am an artist, working on a project set in Rome, the very city, in 50-45 BC. I&amp;#39;ve drawn streets and city scapes before, and they &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have some kind of clutter - I live in Finland, where streets are generally quite tidy, and around here, street clutter consists of random candy/single-package-snack-food wrappers, the occasional lost item of children&amp;#39;s clothes, and plantlife, such as fallen leaves in autumn and dropped branches in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rome, as I&amp;#39;ve understood, was a surprisingly tidy city for its time, but looking at reference photos and artists interpretations of what buildings and streets looked like back in the day, they&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;unnaturally&lt;/em&gt; tidy - no city that has people living in it is completely immaculate, pristine and sterile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rome of the time naturally did not have plastic wrappers, dropped fast food french fries with seagulls and jackdaws fighting over them, or frequent birch trees both intentionally planted and growing wild around city areas like my familiar modern finnish cities do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what kind of street clutter &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; Rome of the era have had?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
