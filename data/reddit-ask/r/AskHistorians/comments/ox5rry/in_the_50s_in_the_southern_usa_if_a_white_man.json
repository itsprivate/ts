Would a black priest face punishment for performing a wedding ceremony for us if we just didn&#39;t register it with the government?\nI know she wouldn&#39;t be allowed to go to white segregated areas, would I be allowed to go with her to black ones?\nIf we got married in another state that allowed it, would Tennessee recognise this?\n(I use Tennessee because that&#39;s where my girlfriend is from, but I would be interested in other places too. I assume Jim Crow laws weren&#39;t identical everywhere.)\nAs a side question, I assume under race laws mixed-race kids counted as black?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
