They are the only country in the area to speak a Romance language and their name literally means \"Roman\", yet their actual territory was ruled by Rome for a relatively short period of time.

Aside from the Black Sea Coast, Roman control of Bulgaria was practically nonexistent compared to other parts of the Balkans, with Dacia being ruled for less than 200 years and client states ruling other parts of the country. Compare this to Bulgaria, which was ruled by Rome in some form or another for over a thousand years, yet today retains very little of that culture compared to Romania.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What factors led to Romania retaining so much of Roman culture?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
