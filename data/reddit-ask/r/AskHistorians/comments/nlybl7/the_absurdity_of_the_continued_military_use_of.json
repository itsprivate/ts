With the notable exception of the United States no military had made semi-automatic rifles standard issue by 1939.\n\nI am aware that the Germans and the Soviets mass produced semi-auto rifles but the overwhelming majority of rifle-caliber guns produced by these nations was still the bolt action rifle by far. I can understand why countries like Italy and Japan would not adopt a semi-auto as their industry did not have the capacity to do such a thing. But a country like Germany of all places not having their own version of the m1 garand is just asinine in my opinion.\n\nI would like to preemptively address one of the talking points I often see when interwar semi automatic rifles are discussed: the argument that the Germans centered their doctrine around the then revolutionary belt-fed light/medium machinegun, and therefore did not see the need for semi-auto rifles. My response to this argument is this: **why wouldn't/couldn't the Germans just have both?** In the 1960s, not too long after the war, the United States had BOTH a main infantry weapon that fired faster than a bolt-action (M16) AND a supplementary belt-fed infantry support LMG (the M60).  (and yes I am aware that the m16 fires an intermediate cartridge but my point still stands).",
