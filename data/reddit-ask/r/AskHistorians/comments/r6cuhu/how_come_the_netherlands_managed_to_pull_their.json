But still... 1.5 million? How is that enough manpower to arm enough soldiers on land to prevent invasions, and sailors to operate a huge fleet? And given the immense wealth and manpower of Spain and Portugal compared to that of the Dutch - what prevented them from just dropping in on Amsterdam and burn it so to keep them out of their business? Or maybe drop in on Calais and march on land if they didn&amp;#39;t have enough naval power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
