I&#39;m now sitting on the deck of a Japanese carrier or on the airfield of an island air base, bombs strapped to my plane, ready to take off. This is not where I want to be. This is not what I want to do. I think the entire war is nonsense and I have zero intention of laying down my life for the war, the emperor, or any other cause. All I want to do is maximize my chances of survival and eventually seeing my family again. </p>\n\n<p>What do I do now? If I simply refuse to take off, what repercussions do I face? If I do take off, how in the world do I, a kamikaze pilot, communicate to the Americans that I want to surrender?  How can I possibly do that without being shot down in the process?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
