Ingesting plants/meat orally can sometimes give you different highs or have a strong effect on the body/mind, but <em>smoking them</em> would take a whole new level of creativity. When and how did humans learn to not only smoke plants but then specifically grow and harvest particularly-powerful plants (opium, cannabis, tobacco, coca plant) for use? Also is there any hard evidence of documented substance abuse/addiction in ancient cultures, and if so what were the repercussions for someone who became physically dependent/addicted to such things? Is there any documented evidence of withdrawals or sickness or death related to medicinal plants?</p>\n\n<p>Side question: Was there ever a time in pre-modern history where <em>medicinal</em> plants were highly sought-after and used as a <em>currency?</em> For example, I would think that the discovery of man&#39;s most effective painkiller (opium) would be quite a massive business long before the Chinese/British opium conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>edit: added coca plant because I forgot about that one :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
