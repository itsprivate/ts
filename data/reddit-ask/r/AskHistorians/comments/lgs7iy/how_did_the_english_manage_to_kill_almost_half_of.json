It's hard to believe these numbers,  the Irish were proportionately ten times more likely than the English to be killed in a war conducted mostly on the English soil. Cromwell might have been a monster but killing 41% of the Irish would be a bigger genocide (percentagewise) than the Holocaust. Are these numbers correct?",
