Most of these places have very long and brutal winters, comparable to [Whitehorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehorse) or [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), Canada's only city with similar population and climate to the Siberian cities, and colder than [Nuuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuuk). (except Vladivostok which is comparable to wonderfully warm [Duluth,\\_Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota)) There are even cities with populations in the hundreds of thousands (ie. [Yakutsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakutsk), [Norilsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk)) that have some truly insane winters that are colder than any other cities in the world and comparable to and often even colder than Arctic research stations. In comparison. northern Canada's largest city, Whitehorse, on;y has a population of around 25,000 and the Yukon, Northwest and Nunavut territories together only add up to just over 100,000 people. Greenland only has \\~56,000.  Why does Siberia have so many large cities in such inhospitable climates?",
