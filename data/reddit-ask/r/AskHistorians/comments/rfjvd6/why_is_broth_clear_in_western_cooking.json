In French stocks the bones are boiled at barely a simmer to avoid emulsifying fats and to make as clear a  stock as possible. In a Japanese paitan (cloudy stock) the bones are agitated and cooked at a rolling boil to make the thickest soup possible. In Japanese food, both chintan (clear stock) and paitan (cloudy stock) are common and desirable. I’ve never heard of an intentionally cloudy western stock. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just thought of an addition. ARE there any intentionally cloudy broths that fell out of fashion?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
