But I think that, largely, the point stands.

Conversely, I also understand the value of a bride price in patriarchal cultures where a daughter would be considered a family &quot;asset&quot; by her parents, in lieu of the work a son could provide instead, to be &quot;cashed in&quot; in marriage. Both financial flows make some sense, but since they&#39;re diametrically opposite, I&#39;d imagine that, in similar cultural circumstances, the socioeconomic benefit of one flow would prevail over the other, and become a universally accepted social norm, rather than both coexisting at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s perplexing how this significant amount of money flowed one way in certain situations, and the other way in others.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
