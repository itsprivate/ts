  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am pretty familiar with the history of support garments in Western Europe - stays/corsets are the quintessential example, the medieval kirtle would have provided bust support once sewing techniques developed, and I&#39;ve seen evidence for a &#39;proto-bra&#39; in various contexts. I have been toying with the idea of investing my own wardrobe with the practicality and comfort of historical clothing, and my first port of call was to refer to my traditional Greek (mine is specifically Cretan) dress, which I understand shares some elements with the general women&#39;s dress of the Ottoman Empire due to occupation/close contact. One thing I&#39;m struggling to understand; how did these women support their breasts?  As far as I can tell, the standard outfit of an Ottoman woman from, say, 1500-1700, for the sake of the question, consisted of trousers/salvar, a chemise/gomlek, and a jacket/zibin - I can&#39;t find any discussion of any other garments with the purpose of support.</p>\n\n<p>My traditional Cretan outfit has a woolen jacket (yialeko) that fastens tight under the bust and can function as support, but I think the Cretan example has more Western influence from Venetian occupation. Outfits in other parts of Greece, however, have a long jacket or vest that is more comparable to the Ottoman zibin, but it seems that the Greek versions fasten tighter around the bust and waist, where the Ottoman one fastened from the neck to the chest, hanging over the bust. Did the zibin ever function as support, or did they just - for want of a better phrase - let it hang? Though bust support is not as necessary for every woman as we may view it today, there must have been at least a few people who couldn&#39;t forgo a bit of extra help.</p>\n\n<p>I also noticed that earlier illustrations show the zibin fastened high, whereas later photographs and paintings (albeit Orientalist and a little bit fetishy) tend to show an open chest on the jacket or chemise, with a sash belt at the waist, which influenced European Turquerie dress. Did the styles develop over time, maybe even in a bit of a give-and-take with Europe in regards to fashionable silhouettes and bust support, or have I just interpreted it wrong?</p>\n\n<p>I could be projecting - I know there are some cultures that don&#39;t seem to have upper body covering at all, so maybe I&#39;m overestimating the importance of bust support entirely. Would it be naive to go with a &#39;people were smaller back then&#39; approach to explain the lack of necessity?</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of being too broad, if anyone knows about dress history in India, China, Korea, or other Asian countries and can shed some light similar topics in those areas, by all means go ahead! I had similar confusion with those, largely because I didn&#39;t know where to start. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if anyone is aware of artists that I could look at for more accurate representation, or any primary sources/research tools that are relevant feel free to drop them here! Most reliable historical fashion resources that I&#39;m aware of focus mainly on western clothing and I&#39;ve found it difficult to research for much else.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
