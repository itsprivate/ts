Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Siam (Thailand), receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. During his trip through Japan, Nicholas had a large dragon tattooed on his right forearm by Japanese tattoo artist Hori Chyo.[27] His cousin George V of England had also received a dragon tattoo from Hori in Yokohama years before.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind is really blown about the idea of royals getting tattoos back then. Especially something as trashy as a whole forearm covering dragon tattoo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would that have been seen in contemporary Russian society? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would something so esoteric and, basically, “foreign” have been talked about? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it seen as poor judgement or was everyone running out and copying his Japanese dragon tattoos in late 1890s Russia??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
