Many SCOTUS justices in the past had also held significant positions elsewhere in the government.  Since Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981, however, no person with elected experience has been appointed to the court.  And today 8 out of 9 justices were previously federal appellate judges.\n\nIf you look at the biographies of the 17 Chief Justices, the difference is really striking. The most recent three justices (Burger, Rehnquist, Roberts) all came from prior judicial positions. Before that, a judicial background was quite rare and most chief justices had previously held high office (of the 14, you have 3 secretaries of state, 3 secretaries of the Treasury, a President, a Senator, a Governor, and only three with judicial backgrounds). The pattern seems to be generally the same with associate justices.\n\nSo far as I can tell, the shift happened around the time of the Nixon administration. Since Nixon, presidents have nominated 17 justices of whom 13 were previously federal appellate judges. Of the 17 justices nominated immediately prior to Nixon, only 5 were previously federal appellate judges and the experience is very diverse and more likely past history (Cabinet Secretaries, Senators, etc.). So what happened?",
