Ie--would the Marcomanni or Frisii have called themselves the proto-Germanic equivalent of Marcommans or Frisians?",

I know that the suffix &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;es&amp;quot; comes from Latin, and I was curious if  these names would be any kind of similar to the names that the tribes would actually have used for themselves or one another, especially since &amp;quot;Germans/Germania&amp;quot; itself was a Roman term and not, as I understand it, one that actual Germans used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the overall accuracy of Tacitus is very questionable and that he is probably closer with some tribes than with others... and that some tribes&amp;#39; only real historical record comes from his work.  But if I am a well-traveled 2nd century native German literate in Latin and I read Tacitus, would I recognize most of the groups he was talking about based on the names he used?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
