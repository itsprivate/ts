  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What I find striking about the rise and spread of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula, and to a lesser degree in the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, is how incredibly fast and thorough it was. Historical commentary from Westerners post-9/11 would have me believe that this was due to a relentless and merciless show of brute force on the part of Muhammad, his close allies, and his heirs, and like many swift and brutal conquests, was entirely self-serving for the conquerors.</p>\n\n<p>I question this narrative. I have a hard time believing Islam would have achieved such thorough and lasting penetration — almost homogeneous in large swaths of the MENA — among the common people, had Islam not been highly attractive to commoners in its promise to solve some pressing social, economic, and political issues which affected them directly, and for which there were no other clear solutions apparent. By way of analogy, I see the Call to Islam as the bump that knocked over a long string of standing dominoes that were just waiting to fall.</p>\n\n<p>If my supposition is at least partially correct, how effective was the widespread conversion (or <em>re</em>version, if you prefer) to Islam in ameliorating these problems, at least until the colonial age and the dawn of modernity?</p>\n\n<p>If Islam had never arisen, would a different (but politically and economically similar) religious movement have likely arisen and had the same effect?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: One day after posting, and 100 upvotes but no replies. I’m not frustrated — this lack of response <em>is</em> a very telling response. What I suspect is that this is a difficult question to answer objectively, and a socially and professionally dangerous topic for a scholar to engage with at all.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for an example of what I mean, Islam bans the loaning and borrowing of money for a fee. This has arguably hindered development, industrialization, and wealth redistribution / poverty eradication in the Muslim world in modern times. But I bet that at the time of its introduction, this ban on usury was revolutionary, and stopped a lot of predation by rich gangsters on the poor. It’s not easy for a civilization to enshrine a practice as so-helpful-it’s-a-godsend, only to be told centuries later that it’s no longer helpful at all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
