According to it, Santa was often depicted taming demons in the 16th to 19th century in the Netherlands and Germanic Europe. Eventually, the demons were redesigned as black skinned moors. Besides the idea of &#39;taming a Moor&#39;, it&#39;s also really bad because of how they replaced a demon with a black skinned person, as if that was the natural progression. </p>\n\n<p>Considering how inflammatory this is, I thought I&#39;d check the sources, but they are all in Dutch. Does anyone have more information on his origin?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
