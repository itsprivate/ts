It&#39;s also conspicuous that most of the &quot;tyrannical legislation&quot; that led to the Revolution — the Sugar Act, Stamp Act, Townshend Duties, and Tea Act — was tax-related. The Quartering Act and Intolerable Acts are an exception to this, but they were reactions to American rebellion directed towards the previous acts. Ultimately, the convergence of economic rights and universal liberties in American founding thought seems strange to me. Was it really that unprecedented to ask colonists — or subjects — to pay taxes? Enlightenment ideas pertained largely to secularism, freedom of speech, consent of the governed, and, yes, property rights. But in the case of the American Revolution, the substantive right involved taxation, and I&#39;m not sure we would call that a &quot;property&quot; right. In the 18th century, did people truly believe that paying higher duties on the importation of goods was no different than one&#39;s property being seized? Even the Bill of Rights only mentions property insofar as it cannot be taken without due process in a trial, but the Constitution allows Congress to tax Americans with absolutely no qualifications. Is it possible that, contrary to popular belief, the American Revolution started because a group of wealthy colonists decided the benefits of receiving protection from the British army and navy no longer exceeded the costs of paying taxes for that protection? And was it those wealthy colonists — the landowners, merchants and lawyers — who disproportionately bore the burden of the taxation, as opposed to artisans and the lower class? On top of that, to what extent was the iconic universal rights jargon of the American Revolution an instrument for articulating grievances in a way that wasn&#39;t self-interested?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
