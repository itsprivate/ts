However, I doubt the general public would have been keen on the idea of such political instability for something as simple as bananas; let alone see it as a selling point. Why did the United Fruit Company choose this as their logo? What was it supposed to represent? For what reason did they think that it would help them sell?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
