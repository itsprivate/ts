And as you learn more, the corrections in accuracy become more and more important. </p>\n\n<p>Since most of you are academic writers, I understand that there is a very strict mindset one must have in order to be as accurate as possible (lest you be destroyed by your colleagues).  This is why the intense policing of this sub is so incredibly scrutinized, and the result is it does provide for some of the most comprehensive and exhaustive answers I&#39;ve seen on the internet.  </p>\n\n<p>But where do people go who just want to ask a question where they might not know what information it is they&#39;re seeking?  If I&#39;m trying to get an understanding of what kind of life a Greek mercenary that fought for Xerxes would have been after the Persian invasion was thwarted, I don&#39;t even know what exactly it is I&#39;m trying to learn.  And that&#39;s where this subreddit seems to break down, and instead the focus turns on only answering questions that have a clear answer. Because after ten years, every one of these kinds of questions has already been asked and answered.</p>\n\n<p>I think this subreddit should actually try to reach out to subs like <a href=\"/r/history\">r/history</a> or <a href=\"/r/AskHistory\">r/AskHistory</a> (at the very least, link them in the FAQ, wiki, or about section so casual buffs can head there), or work with them to both ensure misinformation isn&#39;t being spread on theirs and redirect academic answers to here.</p>\n\n<p>Something tells me, however, that at least one historian will reply with, &quot;We don&#39;t care about raising general knowledge and interest in history. That&#39;s not the job of a historian, and if you don&#39;t like it, you go somewhere else.&quot; But that&#39;s kind of what I mean: <em>where should we go to start?</em></p>\n\n<p>TL;DR This sub is perfect for what it wants to be, but for the sake of raising standards of the general public and the quality of comments in this sub, please work with the other history subreddits to help build the knowledge of all or at least redirect people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
