Himmler explicitly argued, when addressing the question of sending the children to their deaths that this was being done to avoid that a “generation of avengers would rise up to harass our children and grandchildren”, in another point he argues that “this will cause a problem for another generation, that will not, most certainly, have the same opportunity as we are having now”\nI always think to myself if there was any individual or group of individuals or, even, any institution of the Nazi bureaucracy that anticipated what to do in case of victory, how they would tell what had happened (of course they would lie all the way around), but what I want to know  is exactly that: did someone whitin the Nazi framework ever thought about  “how we’re going to deal with that?”. I found a very interesting citation on Wikipedia about a book by Historian Dieter Pohl, on his book “Der Holocaust als offenes Geheimnis”, as it follows: </p>\n\n<p>“Traditional institutions of the Nazi state secretly began the search for a defence strategy for the post-war period in 1943: one had not been informed, and the SS was exclusively to blame.”</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anymore information regarding the aforementioned “defense strategy” by the State.</p>\n\n<p>I wish to thank the Community in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
