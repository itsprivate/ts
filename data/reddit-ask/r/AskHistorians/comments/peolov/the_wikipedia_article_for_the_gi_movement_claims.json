But maybe the information just isn&#39;t well known, caught in the wide umbrella of anti-Vietnam activity that I just never heard it. Or maybe it was covered up or suppressed in some way, I&#39;ve recently been reading up on some of the resistance and unrest as well as acts of violence committed by the the government that happened in the US in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s that I was never taught, so perhaps this is more of that.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, does anyone have any idea where this number comes from and if it accurately reflects incidents of fragging during the Vietnam War?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
