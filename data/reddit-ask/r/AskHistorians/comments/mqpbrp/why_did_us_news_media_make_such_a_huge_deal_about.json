Even adjusted for inflation, the price increases seemed minor; the amount wouldn't raise an eyebrow today.  \"COFFEE PRICES UP TWO CENTS PER POUND\" -- in 1955, the equivalent of 2021 US$0.20 (2021  US$0.44/kg).  \n\nDuring my Generation X childhood and teen years, I don't remember any extensive media attention about changes in commodity prices, except maybe for coffee.  Even then, the shifts were big, like a dollar a pound.

I know household incomes were much lower in inflation-adjusted USD, and that the inflation rate was very low between the 1930s and early 1960s.  Were the prices of staple commodities so much lower compared to today (in inflation-adjusted USD) that minor increases were a big deal, relatively speaking?   For what it's worth, most of the research I've been doing has been in urban and suburban newspapers in New York state, not Midwestern ag states.\n\nThere's more important questions, I know.  It's just that the attention given to these price changes seemed way out of proportion to their impact, by today's standards.",
