It was in Poland that the Einsatzgruppen were to fulfill their mission as “ideological soldiers” by eliminating the educated classes of a defeated enemy. (&lt;strong&gt;They were in some sense killing their peers: fifteen of the twenty-five Einsatzgruppe and Einsatzkommando commanders had doctorates.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snyder is citing Browning&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Origins of the Final Solution&lt;/em&gt;, which says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As in Poland, Heydrich did not hesitate to draw from his stable of highly\neducated Nazis. Of the four Einsatzgruppen commanders, three held a total of\nfour doctorates: Dr. Dr. Otto Rasch of EG C, Dr. Franz Walter Stahlecker of EG A,\nand Dr. Otto Ohlendorf of EG D. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the seventeen sk, ek, and Vorkommando\nchiefs, a further seven held the doctorate: Dr. Martin Sandberger (sk 1a), Dr.\nErich Ehrlinger (sk 1b), Dr. Walter Blume (sk 7a), Dr. Erhard Kroeger (ek 6),\nDr. Otto Bradfisch (ek 8), Dr. Alfred Filbert (ek 9), and Prof. Dr. Franz Six\n(Vorkommando Moscow). Some were taken from the upper ranks of the rsha in\nBerlin: Nebe, Ohlendorf, Six, Sandberger, Filbert, Blume, and Erwin Schulz\n(ek 5). Rasch and Stahlecker commanded the Security Police headquarters in\nKönigsberg and Prague. Many others were branch Office Security Police and\nGestapo chiefs: Rudolf Batz (ek 2) from Hanover, Günther Hermann (sk 4b)\nfrom Brünn, Heinz Seetzen (sk 10a) from Hamburg, and Gustav Nosske (ek 12)\nfrom Aachen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever their immediate previous postings, most of these officers had risen\nthrough Heydrich’s SD. They virtually all shared the same ideological outlook\nconcerning Jews, Bolsheviks, and Slavs and Germany’s imperial future in the\neast as well as attitudes and dispositions of ‘‘energetic ruthlessness,’’ initiative,\nand activism that were the common characteristics of the SS intellectual elite. If\nthe top officers were handpicked, there is no indication that ideological reliability was ever seen as a necessary distinguishing criterion among the candidates under consideration&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Browning is citing here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Krausnick and Wilhelm, Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges, p. 148; Ogorreck,\n‘‘Die Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei,’’ p. 152.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which, well, I can&amp;#39;t read.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m misreading this, but Browning seems to state, contra Snyder, that it was actually 11/21 commanders/subcommanders that had doctorates (one had &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, what on earth is going on here?  Is this maybe some quirk of the German academic system, and these people actually had the equivalent of Juris Doctors, with lawyers overrepresented in the elite police circles Himmler was pulling from? How common was a doctorate among Nazi officers?  What did these people tend to have their doctorates in?  Were they &amp;quot;STEM&amp;quot;, like how contemporary terrorists commonly have graduate education in engineering?  Or humanities scholars radicalized in the academy?  Why were they chosen for these jobs over mere ideological fanatics with a taste for blood, like you&amp;#39;d usually envision running a death squad?  How and why did a bunch of trained academics end up getting charged with murdering all the Jews in eastern europe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
