We hear plenty about this in early-modern warfare -- took a musket ball to the pinky toe, cut off the leg to ward off gangrene (perhaps a slight embellishment) -- but I realized I don't hear very much about male Roman citizens dying en masse from shaving.\n\nYet, with unclean water, no antibiotics, and razors that almost certainly were less gentle, uniform and delicate (and less clean) than my factory-mass-produced Gillettes, it'd seem to me rather likely that minor shaving wounds would occur often, and that they might well become infected with ease and progress to death (especially as you can't amputate the head as easily as you can a limb -- or at least not without causing unintended side effects such as death). \n\nI know republican and early imperial Rome had a particular stylistic emphasis on clean-shaven males, to the point of wearing a moustache being seen (if I understand correctly) as a clear political/ethnic statement on Gallic/Germanic heritage. So let's take them as an example. What gives? Were they really dropping like flies from shaving, quaking in fear at the thought of their bathroom in the morning?\n\nPut another way, why would any culture with even the most basic understanding of wound infection (which the Romans certainly had -- get wound, starts going all smelly, bad news) promote a stylistic motif like shaving that would kill significant amounts of its adherents?\n\nOr, perhaps I've missed something, and the reason I don't hear about the tragic shaving death of 35% of Rome's emperors is because it didn't happen, and my initial premise is faulty -- shaving and other trivial wounds didn't result in infection, perhaps, or they knew how to combat minor infections of that variety. I don't know.\n\nBut I'm very curious! Hope someone knows the answer! \n\nThanks, as ever, r/AskHistorians, you are (though it's oft-said) the best community on Reddit by a country mile.",
