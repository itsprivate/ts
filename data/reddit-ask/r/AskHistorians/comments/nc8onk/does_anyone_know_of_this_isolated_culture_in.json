I am not able to find any articles referencing this culture anywhere, despite searching (thought it is hard to craft a good search term for this). \n\nDoes anybody know of this culture? Can someone send me a legitimate article on this subject matter? Is this real or is it just somr made up crap someone is trying to spread on social media?\n\nEdit\" it seems that it is the Musuo people and that they are a matriarchal society but this painting of it as a feminist utopia is not true at all. They do have rape and murder, thought technically they dint have specific words for murder vs just to kill. Rape is punished by death. Women are also extremely pressured to have babies, women are not seen as \"complete\" unless they have kids, which is ridiculous. So the propaganda going around about this being the perfect utopia is simply false.
