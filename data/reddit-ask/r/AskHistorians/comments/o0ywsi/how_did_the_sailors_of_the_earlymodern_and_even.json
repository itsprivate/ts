How did sailors before the invention of sunglasses (and sunscreen!) dealt with the problem? I know they probably wore hats but that didn't help much in terms of helping you look across the glimmering bright sea well. I've noted that black kohl are used by Asiatic nomads in arid areas but have no idea if Europeans or people in other places were aware of it (or if kohl did anything to help at all).  \n\n\nThank you in advance",
