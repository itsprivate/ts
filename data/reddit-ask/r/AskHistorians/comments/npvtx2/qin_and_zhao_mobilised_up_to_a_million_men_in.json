That would take a lot of time and work and surely once they had realised what Qin has planned for them they would resist and fight back?\n\nAfter a brief search on the internet it seems to me that such figures were not heavily challenged. There're two similar questions asked on this sub but one of the answers was deleted, and the other one doesn't include a lot of credible sources (the author only included a link to baidu which imho is not a credible source).\n\nMany battles in the Warring States and Han period seem to have involved armies in sizes that are hard to believe. My question is, how historically accurate is the description of the battle of ChangPing? Is it exaggerated, if so what is the modern estimations? What is the academic consensus on this?",
