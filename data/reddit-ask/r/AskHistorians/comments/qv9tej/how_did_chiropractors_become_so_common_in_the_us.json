Moved to a medium size town in the US and seems like they are everywhere, lots of people mention visiting them and feeling so great after their visits. This greatly surprised me, as back home chiro is generally considered pseudoscience and most people would rather visit an MD for their health issues. I assume this is another one of those things that are unique to the US, but if my premise is wrong please let me know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
