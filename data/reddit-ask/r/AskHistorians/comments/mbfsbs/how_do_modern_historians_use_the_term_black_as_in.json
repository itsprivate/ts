Even in modern times, the term means different things in different places – a person who's considered black in the US may instead be identified as mixed in Brazil or Arab in Sudan. \n\nMoreover, the term \"black\" seems to be designed for an American context (perhaps due to the one-drop rule). After all, a person from Ethiopia doesn't have much in common with a Nigerian when it comes to culture, language, and customs. It doesn't make sense to group them, yet most people, at least outside of Africa, would still consider both people as black. \n\nI've seen other terms used instead: Sub-Saharan Africa(ns) for example. But that seems to play into the old stereotype of \"merging\" North Africa more together with Europe and/or Asia and downplaying its connections with the rest of the continent. \n\nI feel like whatever term you use is inherently flawed. Let's say I would like to study the history of black people (both on the African continent and in the international diaspora): is there a way to accurately describe this? Is it more \"correct\" to say \"I would like to study the history of black people\" or are you better suited to say \"I would like to study the history of sub-Saharan Africa and its diaspora\"?\n\nThe more I think about it the more confused I get.",
