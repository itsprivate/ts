Patton solved this problem by ordering black soldiers, including the 761st, to guard the checkpoints, and gave the order to shoot any white soldiers at the checkpoints who acted suspiciously.</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761st_Tank_Battalion_(United_States\"><em>[23]</em></a>#cite_note-23)   </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately the citation leads to a wayback machine archived website that has the beginning part of his story, however not the relevant section.  Is there anyway to find the relevant portion of the interview?  It would be great to shine some light on a small but interesting contribution of African Americans to the war effort.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
