A common thing to see in movies and TV made before the mid 2000s, was that when your credit card was declined, it would be destroyed. The clerk at the grocery store would pull out a big pair of scissors and cut your card in half. Or your waitress returns to your table with your card cut up into little tiny pieces...</p>\n\n<p>Did that actually happen? It seems like the ultimate dick move on the part of the business you&#39;re shopping at. If I&#39;m shopping at your store and discover in that moment that my account is overdrawn, or that I need to move some money around in my bank accounts to put more money on that card, how is cutting up my card nessecery? You just took a small issue of having to pay a bill, or transfer money around, and turned it into a bigger hassle. Now I have to order a new card and wait for it to arrive in the mail. ...and once I get it, I&#39;m certainly not going to use this new card at that store that felt they had the authority over my finances to destroy my bank card.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
