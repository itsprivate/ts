Just because I'm striving for experthood doesn't mean I can't ask for help along the way! So I'm turning to you, community. Why did the Soviets memorialize Kropotkin like they did?

To add onto his question, I'm also particularly curious what the thought process was when the Palace of the Soviets Metro station was renamed to Kropotkinskaya in 1957. The simple answer is that it was named after the Kropotkin Gate neighborhood, which was named after Kropotkin because he was born there, but it can't have been that simple. Why that local name out of all the others? Why not Prechistenskaya, which is also a local name for the neighborhood? Someone had to have had a reason for Kropotkin in particular.",
