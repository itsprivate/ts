He&#39;s being portrayed as surrounded by Roman/Greek gods helping along American historical figures, like Mercury teaching Robert Morris about commerce. Not only that, but Washington himself is portrayed as a godlike figured who ascended to heaven to become a God, which the title &quot;Apotheosis of Washington&quot; clearly implies.</p>\n\n<p>It seems almost like a parody of American religiosity, but it&#39;s also a product of its time, coming right after the civil war and also not being the only likely deified portrayal of Washington. But still, it&#39;s such a brazen portrayal of a human man as a God as well as being surrounded by pagan deities helping American historical figures, was it at all contraversial?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
