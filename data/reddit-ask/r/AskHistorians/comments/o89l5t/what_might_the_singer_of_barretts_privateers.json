The ship is completely unfit for service and is destroyed by the Americans, with only the singer surviving, but with the loss of his legs, and in 1784 he&#39;s a broken man on a Halifax pier in his early 20s. Now what happens to him? Without legs, I presume he can&#39;t easily work, especially being an uneducated peasant. I don&#39;t know that a privateer could get a pension from the crown. Is there any sort of welfare system at all? Is he relegated to begging? Is there any kind of mobility aid available to him? How does society probably see him?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
