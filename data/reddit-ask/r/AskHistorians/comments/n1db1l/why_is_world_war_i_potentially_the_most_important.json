My girlfriend’s sister is doing a project on it for school, where she is supposed to do her own research on the topic and give a presentation. She asked me to help her with it, knowing that it’s sort of my area of historical expertise, and I was stunned when she told me that has never learned about it and doesn’t even know what countries fought in it, or why, and maybe the Nazis had something to do with it. My own father told me that he was under the impression we simply “fought Hitler the first time.”\n\nIs it the brutality of the combat that makes it a difficulty to teach to children? The potential to germinate thoughts that go against the America-good-guy-world-police narrative like “if the ‘bad guys’ had won,(and they almost did) the world might be a better place because there would be no Nazis and no Holocaust, and no Soviet Union and no Cold War, and therefore my country is not infallible”? Or is the complex geopolitical scenario at that time simply too difficult or boring to teach to kids?\n\nI’d like thoughts from any educators that might be out there if possible as well. This is so disheartening to me. We’re talking about the birth of the modern world, a complete revolution in technology, politics, science, philosophy, medicine, the complete and utter destruction of the old order of things. Our reality hangs on a single bullet fired by the son of a mailman in a tiny European minor most people couldn’t find on a map, and 99.9% of Americans don’t know that these events even happened and if they have some idea, they don’t know why, or to who. Can anyone shed light on this for me?",
