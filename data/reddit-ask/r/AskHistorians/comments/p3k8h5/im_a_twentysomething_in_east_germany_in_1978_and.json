Being grown up myself in the far west of Germany in the 1970s/1980s, I very well remember how much of a sensation the &quot;Krieg der Sterne&quot; movie stirred. It was prominently reviewed in television, even one of the most popular game shows had a special issue where an actor in a C-3PO costume was reading the questions for the contestants. As west german television was widely watched in East Germany, most people there would have known about this ground-breaking space opera movie that everybody in the western world want to see.</p>\n\n<p>Now more than 30 years after the fall of the wall, there are mostly anecdotal, contradictory, and often romanticizing stories floating around about how the usage of western media in the GDR really was. One urban legend says that children were asked by their teacher how the clock in the evening news looked like (west german news &#39;Tagesschau&#39; had a different one than the east german &#39;Aktuelle Kamera&#39;), and when a child gave the wrong answer, it was added to the Stasi records, and could bring its parents into trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Between people on the one extreme who are glorifying the GDR, and the other side where this place is painted as a schizophrenical oppressive dictatorship where you had to be paranoid all the time, I&#39;m looking for reliable information how it really was. Is there reliable historical research going on about this? It is basically these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How prevalent was western media in the GDR? Not only TV, but also movies (as illegal copies, how? super-8? VHS?) Books, magazines etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>What was really the official stance on citizens that were consuming western media? Was it just disapproved, or could one get into real trouble? Could our hypothetical twentysomething be denied entry to university just for expressing the desire to see a space opera movie, when a nearby stasi informer was eavesdropping?</p></li>\n<li><p>Were there privileged people who actually had more easy access to western media?</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
