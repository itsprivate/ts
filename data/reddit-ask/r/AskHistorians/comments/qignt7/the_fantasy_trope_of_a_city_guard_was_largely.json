Villages had a general tradition called the &quot;hue and cry,&quot; where someone in distress would make an undefined call and everyone nearby was duty-bound to respond and deal with the assailant. Cities might have something vaguely similar, but this was mostly to keep violent incidents from escalating and not to enforce common laws. Part of the issue was that there wasn&#39;t a defined concept of the rule of law, and most laws were civil (harm against another person) rather than criminal (harm against society in general).</p>\n\n<p>Again, the previous paragraph is based on my limited research; I am very much an amateur.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m wondering is whether the trope described in the first paragraph existed <em>anywhere</em> in the premodern world.

There are lots of civilizations that I don&#39;t know about, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;ve missed something.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
