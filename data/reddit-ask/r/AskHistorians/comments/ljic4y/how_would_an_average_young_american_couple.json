I'm curious how accurate that picture really is. \n\nHow would an average young heterosexual couple, perhaps aged about 20, in pre-World War II America (maybe late 19th/early 20th centuries) have approached sexual intimacy? What would their expectations surrounding intimacy be with each other? Especially as their relationship grew more serious. Let's say they were in a loving relationship and on trajectory for an engagement and then marriage. Would they both have the expectation that there would be absolutely no physical intimacy between them until their wedding night? Or would they expect a gradual increase in physical intimacy as their relationship progressed. Perhaps they would see sexual intercourse as off-limits until marriage because the lack of reliable contraception, but would they expect other things such as cuddling, \"feeling up\", manual sex, or oral sex before their marriage? If so, at what point along their timeline of courting, engagement, and marriage would they expect those things? Is there a point where they would expect to progress to intercourse, perhaps after their engagement? Would they talk about this with each other, as couples often do today? \n\nWhat would their families think? Would parents try to prevent them from having time alone? Or would the parents have the opinion (as most parents do today), of \"Oh, they're engaged, it's all right if they engage in sexual intimacy as long as they don't risk an unplanned pregnancy.\" Or even, \"it's all right if they're having intercourse because they're already engaged and going to be married next month anyways\". \n\nAnd how might this differ between social classes, by region, by religion, etc.? \n\nI realize this was such a taboo at that time, that there might not even be good reliable sources about it. Perhaps only people's personal journals or letters detailing their thoughts and personal experiences.",
