There was clearly an entire industry dedicated to providing dead and easy to dissect frog cadavers to public schools.  Did that service not exist 40 years ago?  They just brought in dozens of live frogs and had the kids passively kill them and watch them slowly die before dissecting their fresh bloody corpse like little Jeffrey Dahmers?</p>\n\n<p>Also did they really do that when kids where 10 like Elliot was?
