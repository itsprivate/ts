In America, that changed (for men) in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s when it became extremely easy for an 18 year old to get a job that paid more than enough to live comfortably on or even to afford college which would practically guarantee an even better job. [Edit: Was the GI Bill a major factor here?]</p>\n\n<p>And now those jobs don&#39;t exist, and guess what! People are living with their parents again! But that 70-year span was <em>just long enough</em> that it fell out of common memory, so now kids are &quot;failures&quot; because the economics have changed.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a great deal of American culture is still based on the memory of the &#39;40s and &#39;50s as baseline normalcy despite them being a total fluke at the time. World War II and McCarthyism created a massive shift toward rabid patriotism, Christian fundamentalism, and the ideal of the &quot;nuclear family&quot; which resembled nothing before it and which [endures] because many of our most powerful politicians are just old enough that this period of sudden fanaticism is <em>their</em> &quot;nostalgic good &#39;ole days&quot; and &quot;the way things are <em>supposed</em> to be.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
