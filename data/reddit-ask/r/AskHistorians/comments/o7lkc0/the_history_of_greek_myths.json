I&#39;ve tried to look for some history of the development of Greek myth but it&#39;s hard to get beyond retellings of the myths themselves. Is there  much information about when certain beliefs emerged, or is it mostly speculative? </p>\n\n<p>For instance, there&#39;s two simultaneous goddesses of the moon - Semele (Titan) and Artemis (Olympian). Were they simultaneous? Or were they regional? Or did Artemis supplant Semele? Is there anything to show when the stories of e.g. the birth of Artemis and Apollo or Athena emerged, and do these seem to be much later than than the beginning of them being worshipped? Did their cults grow up after the cults of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and the other &#39;original&#39; Olympians, and is there anything to show how and when a coherent sense of the 12 Olympian gods as a complete pantheon came into play? </p>\n\n<p>I find it so fascinating that e.g. Leto, the Titaness mother of Apollo and Artemis, had temples dedicated to her, as per the myth of  Leucippus, even though she wasn&#39;t a &#39;god&#39;. Is this comparable to having a devotion to particular saints in Catholicism/Orthodox Christianity?</p>\n\n<p>I find it tempting to read a history of how beliefs developed in the region into the mythic history - with Gaia, Uranus and the nature spirits being older deities, who were supplanted by worship of the Titans - perhaps originally the gods of a conquering tribe - who in turn lost ground to belief in the Olympians as their adherents gained power in the region. However this seems too neat and obvious! Would love some pointers on where to read more about this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
