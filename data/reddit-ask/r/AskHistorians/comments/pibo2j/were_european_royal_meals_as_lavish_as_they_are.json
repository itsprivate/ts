Is there any accuracy in popular media to how much food these people ate? Was it just commonplace for rulers to have more food than they could ever eat realistically? Perhaps just as a centerpiece or to show off their wealth?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, what did they do with surplus food, was it ever donated to the poor? I realize I am talking about a 2000 year period from Rome to 20th century Europe, but I&#39;d love to know how this evolved over time. Perhaps they eventually realized how wasteful it was.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
