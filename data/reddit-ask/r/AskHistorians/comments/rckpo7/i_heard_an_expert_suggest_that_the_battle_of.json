He&amp;#39;s comparing the reaction to the victory from the British public (sorrow over Nelson&amp;#39;s death, displays of patriotism) with the government&amp;#39;s (cynicism), and he says this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think the (British) government knows full well that Trafalgar has done very little to shape the course of the war. As reports come back, as Vice-Admiral Collingwood&amp;#39;s dispatches arrive, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that whilst Britain has captured and sunk a number of enemy ships, a lot have escaped. And of course the admiralty and the British government would have known that there were plenty of other French fleets stationed around Europe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This surprised me, as it contradicts my own conception of Trafalgar as a major turning point not only in the Napoleonic Wars, but also in world history. Is my impression the result of a successful British propaganda campaign around Trafalgar? Was it really not that materially consequential?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
