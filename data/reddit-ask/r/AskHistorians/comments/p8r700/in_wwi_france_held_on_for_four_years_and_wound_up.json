Does the push through the Ardennes basically describe the entire failure of the French in WWII? Could one say that advancements in the speed and armor of tanks made the Ardennes maneuver possible, and it would have been implausible in WWI? Is technology ultimately the difference between French success and failure in the World Wars?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
