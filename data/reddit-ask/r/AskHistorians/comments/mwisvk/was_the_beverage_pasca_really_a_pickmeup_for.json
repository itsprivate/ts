I looked it up and found many dozens of recipes online, and they all described a drink from water, vinegar, and various miscellaneous ingredients, usually including honey.\n\nThe recipe I ended up using, which is based on one I found with my own touches, is this:\n\n*Pasca\"\n\n(1 serving - 2 min prep time or less)\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 10 oz of room temperature water\n* 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar\n* 1-1/2 tbsp honey\n* 2 dashes salt\n* 2 dashes pepper\n* 1 tsp of ground cloves or cinnamon\n* Optional: small splash of lemon\n\nTo prepare:\n\n- Pour the honey onto the bottom of the glass or mug you will drink from.\n- Microwave on high for 15 sec\n- Pour water into glass, stir and dissolve the honey\n- Add vinegar, stir again\n- Add salt, pepper, spice; stir one last time\n- Add lemon juice to top it off\n\nI've had this a few times now, and here's my opinion:\n\n- it's good\n- it's thirst-quenching\n- it really is a pick-me-up.\n\nI can definitely see how the vinegar would be useful to disinfect water, how honey would replenish energy, how salt would stabilize electrolytes, and the spices make it all really tasty and exotic. But to my question: did the Romans really drink this \"pasca\" habitually? If so, who and when?  Athletes? Soldiers? It seems like an ancient form of Gatorade, after a fashion.\n\nIt also strikes me as totally healthy and refreshing, even with a modern palate, so it's surprising to me that the West would have forgotten about this drink.",
