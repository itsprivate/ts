  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m rereading Oliver Twist for the first time since high school (teenage me did not appreciate Dickens at all), and I was struck by the fact that Fagin is immediately identified in the narrative as Jewish. It&#39;s not explicitly stated that Oliver recognizes him as such, but my read is that it&#39;s implied. </p>\n\n<p>However, I was struck by the fact that, within the scene where he is first introduced, Fagin is described as having red hair (not a trait which immediately makes me think of Jewish populations), and also as cooking sausages. Now, this is certainly my own lived experience of secular Judaism tinting my perspective, but I generally assume sausage (particularly at that time and place) to be pork. I know plenty of Jewish people do not keep kosher, but -- again, my own lived experience speaking -- it&#39;s not uncommon for Jews to not keep kosher but also avoid certain <em>treyf</em> foods (for example, not a person in my entire extended Jewish family has ever kept kosher, but I&#39;m pretty sure that not a one of us has ever cooked a porkchop or shrimp). To me, it&#39;s almost comedic, because there are two things that suggest Fagin is <em>not</em> Jewish, while Dickens is tripping over himself to remind the reader that he <em>is</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I know there is plenty to be discussed regarding Dickens&#39; antisemitism both in his work and as a person, but I&#39;m curious about the historicity of this and particularly how contemporary readers would have received and interpreted the character. I know, regrettably, the view of Jews as thieves and crooks was not new, but was it widespread enough in early Victorian England that it was enough &quot;evidence&quot;, as it were, of Fagin&#39;s Judaism? Are there other clues hiding in the text? </p>\n\n<p>For that matter, while we&#39;re here, how well-integrated was the Jewish population in working-class London? I know there were the rare and exceptional cases like the Rothschilds, but among the normal gentile population, was there a lot of preconception of &quot;what Jews look like&quot;?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
