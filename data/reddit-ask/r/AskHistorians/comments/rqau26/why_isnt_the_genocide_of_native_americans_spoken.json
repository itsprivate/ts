I find this hard to explain given conservative estimates of the death toll of Native American is said to be roughly 12 million according to Russell Thornton, and vary significantly with a toll of 100 million documented by D.E Stannard, author of ‘The American Holocaust’, the reasonable conclusion seems to land at around 75 million lives lost between Columbus’ arrival in 1492-1900, which works out to be close to 90% of the entire Native American population, with 5 million remaining today. Could someone please explain why, with a conservative estimate of twice as many lives lost, it isn’t spoken of with the same condemnation as the Holocaust, or if you were educated on the subject differently to what I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
