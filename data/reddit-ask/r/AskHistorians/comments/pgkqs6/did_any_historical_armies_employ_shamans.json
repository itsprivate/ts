Soumaoro Kanté himself was also said to be performing evil magic.  </p>\n\n<p>About 8 months ago, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kt3mu7/battles_in_mesoamerica_often_used_religious/\">a post on this sub</a> claimed deploying battlefield sorcerers (called &quot;Tlatlacateculo &quot; or &quot;Owl Men&quot;) was a common practice among Mesoamerican tribes, and that they had even been sent against Cortes by the Aztecs. However, the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kt3mu7/battles_in_mesoamerica_often_used_religious/gikxwob?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">top commenter</a> indicated that our knowledge about the <em>Owl Men</em> is mostly speculative at this point. I, personally, had trouble finding good, English-language sources about them on Google.  </p>\n\n<p>One result on Google books, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ORvUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Shamans of the Foye Tree</a>, briefly describes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche\">Mapuche</a> tribes as deploying shamans (called <em>Machi Weye</em>) alongside warriors to the battlefield at the end of Ch. 5. The <em>Machi Weye</em> were tasked with performing &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; from the sidelines, piercing themselves and using their own blood to call down spirits to protect their warriors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the first two results aren&#39;t the most reliable, and although the third result seems legit to me, I have no idea if a professional would agree.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m kicking the question to you, <a href=\"/r/AskHistorians\">r/AskHistorians</a>! Find any magic-users in your armies?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
