Obsidian blades? How common a tool was a knife for the average person? Do we know? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read about the mass production of bone tools, and I imagine that stone knives were relatively common, but were they necessary for every individual, or were they the sort of thing a community leader might have and allow to be used as needed, like how bread ovens were basically one-per-community? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to get a sense of  when metal knives became a common household / personal item and what would have been normal before that time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I realize that &amp;quot;the Bronze Age&amp;quot; is pretty broad, but I&amp;#39;m interested in broad trends and would be happy with an answer about any region, urban or rural, settled or nomadic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
