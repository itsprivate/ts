But this made me wonder, how many people were funneled into sex work back then? And also, was prostitution considered work or was it more of a poverty/slavery situation, or even women being owned (like with pimps). Was sex trafficking a huge threat? </p>\n\n<p>I know it’s a weird question, but I never have been able to find the answer and i’ve been wondering for years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
