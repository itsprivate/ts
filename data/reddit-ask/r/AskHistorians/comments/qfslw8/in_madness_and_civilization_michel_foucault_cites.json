I might have made some fatal misreadings.</p>\n\n<p>This is my reading of it thus far</p>\n\n<p>(Please take it with a grain of salt):</p>\n\n<p>Summary:</p>\n\n<p>With examples, Foucault is illustrating a long sequence of ideological shifts related to how madness has been interpreted and responded to.  He says that there were a series of romantic and  satiric &quot;Ships of ____&quot; in literature and art.  And claims that among them,  the &#39;Ship of Fools&#39; was the only one to truly exist. Particularly in Nuremberg. He goes on to say that it happened after it was discovered that isolating Lepers in the middle ages actually succeeded in reducing leprosy,  and it was then imagined that the same approach could be taken to madness, and then it happened.</p>\n\n<p>He claims that they were handed over to merchants, sailors and pilgrims who would  take responsibility for them for a time. It was claimed that the changing scenery, confinement onboard, and religious pilgrimages were thought to have a positive effect on them.  At worst the practice was just a way of shuffling the &#39;mad&#39; around to someone else&#39;s backyard.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot; But of all these romantic or satiric vessels, the Narrenschiff is  the only one that had a real existence—for they did exist, these  boats that conveyed their insane cargo from town to town.  Madmen then led an easy wandering existence. The towns drove  them outside their limits; they were allowed to wander in the  open countryside, when not entrusted to a group of merchants  and pilgrims. The custom was especially frequent in Germany; in  Nuremberg, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the presence  of 63 madmen had been registered; 31 were driven away....&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>It goes on...  <strong>Where is he getting these numbers?  Maybe it&#39;s my monolingual poverty showing but where does he get his sources?    Were  &#39;ships of fools&#39; really a thing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>All I can find is references to an allegory in Plato&#39;s: Republic, and the poem Foucault mentions.  Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
