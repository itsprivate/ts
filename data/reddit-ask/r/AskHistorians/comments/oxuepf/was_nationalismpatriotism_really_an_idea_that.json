European kingdoms were still named after the ethnic groups or dominant tribe in them. And Saint Bede for example described the Angles, Jutes, and Saxons as &quot;English&quot;, using the term &quot;natio&quot; to describe them, while another monk, Gildas, wrote a diatribe against his fellow Britons as a people in the 6th century, and a writer by the name of Hector Boece wrote a historical account of Britain that was essentially Scottish propaganda in the 16th century.  Meanwhile in my country of Japan, the Sengoku warlords fought over &quot;uniting all under heaven&quot; (i.e. uniting Japan) all the way back in the, well, Sengoku period. Back in Europe, the Polish noble class used to claim that they were Turkic, and Italian city states also had some degree of democracy, so surely there must have been some kind of proto nationalism; and going further back, wasn&#39;t city pride extremely high in the Greek city states, and didn&#39;t the Ancient Romans have a strong culture of nationalism/Roman exceptionalism? What seems to be nationalistic rhetoric can be read in the Bible too, with the whole &quot;God&#39;s people&quot; and &quot;promised land&quot; thing. What&#39;s going on here? Hell, just before the French Revolution, the American Revolution happened, and nationalist sentiment abound in the years leading up to that one. Even ethnic stereotypes existed as far back as the middle ages at least, with things like French soldiers calling English soldiers &quot;Le Goddamns&quot;. It just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>\n\n<p>I know countries were just lands that a ruler happened to own or control for much of history, but was there really <em>nothing</em> resembling national pride or patriotism, no kind of sentimental value attached to the land and borders one lived in or one&#39;s ethnic in-group, at all, whatsoever, before the French Revolution? Or was it just that such ideas weren&#39;t <em>widespread</em> among the <em>general population</em>? I also think that belief in a certain line of rulers&#39; right to rule a certain people/land or personality cults around a ruler for example are a form of nationalism due to parallels in more modern history, so is it just that whatever existed before the Revolution doesn&#39;t fit a certain narrow definition of what patriotism/nationalism is that requires solid borders? And even if it did just sort of pop into existence during the Revolution, where did this new idealogy come from anyway? Surely it had to have come from somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>I asked the professor of a course I was taking one semester, and the response I got was &quot;it&#39;s complicated&quot;. So I&#39;m led to believe that there&#39;s more to this, and that the whole &quot;National pride is new&quot; thing is a great oversimplification, despite it often being used to contradict simplistic pop history.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
