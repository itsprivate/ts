Recently watched Star Trek: Voyager, which had Chakotay.

Where did that clear focus on Native American characters and casting start?  And why did it seem to end in the Bush era?  Was there a Clinton administration executive order or policy focused on encouraging positive portrayals of natives in popular media?  Or was it just that Hollywood saw that Native American stuff was making money and winning awards so everyone rushed to get on the bandwagon?",
