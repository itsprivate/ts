As such it is and must be but the prelude to the armed and indignant protest of these despised and raped peoples.  Today Japan is hammering on the door of justice, China is raising her half-manacled hands to knock next, India is writhing for the freedom to knock, Egypt is sullenly muttering, the Negroes of South and West Africa, of the West Indies, and of the United States are just awakening to their shameful slavery.  Is, then, this war the end of wars?  Can it be the end, so long as sits enthroned, even in the souls of those who cry peace, the despising and robbing of darker peoples?  If Europe hugs this delusion, then this is not the end of world war,—­it is but the beginning!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned very little about World War I in school. Thank you very much to anyone who can comment on the historical accuracy of all this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  wanted to share some other paragraphs from this essay supporting this same idea in case you&amp;#39;re interested:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whither is this expansion? What is that breath of life,  thought to be so indispensable to a great European nation? Manifestly it is expansion overseas; it is colonial aggrandizement which explains, and alone adequately explains, the World War. How many of us today fully realize the current theory of colonial expansion, of the relation of Europe which is white, to the world which is black and brown and yellow? Bluntly put, that theory is this: It is the duty of white Europe to divide up the darker world and administer it for Europe&amp;#39;s good. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another quote: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thus the world market most wildly and desperately sought today is the market where labor is cheapest and most helpless and profit is most abundant. This labor is kept cheap and helpless cause&lt;br/&gt;\n the white world despises &amp;quot;darkies.&amp;quot; If one has the temerity to suggest that these workingmen may walk the way of white workingmen and climb by votes and self-assertion and education to the rank of men, he is howled out of&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;court. They cannot do it and if they could, they shall not, for they are the enemies of the white race and the whites shall rule forever and forever and everywhere. Thus the hatred and despising of human beings from whom Europe wishes to extort her luxuries has led to such jealousy and bickering between European nations that they have fallen afoul of each other and have fought like crazed beasts. Such is the fruit of human hatred.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a third quote: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fateful day came. It had to come. The cause of war is preparation for war; and of all that Europe has done in a century there is nothing that has equaled in energy, thought, and time her preparation for wholesale murder. The only adequate cause of this preparation was conquest and conquest, not in Europe, but primarily among the darker peoples of Asia and Africa; conquest, not for assimilation and uplift, but for commerce and degradation. For this, and this mainly, did Europe gird herself at frightful cost for war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red day dawned when the tinder was lighted in the Balkans and Austro-Hungary seized a bit which brought her a step nearer to the world&amp;#39;s highway; she seized one bit and poised herself for another. Then came that curious chorus of challenges, those leaping suspicions, raking all causes for distrust and rivalry and hatred, but saying little of the real and greatest cause.  Each nation felt its deep interests involved. But how? Not, surely, in the death of Ferdinand the Warlike; not, surely, in the old, half-forgotten revanche for Alsace-Lorraine; not even in the neutrality of Belgium. No! But in the possession of and overseas, in the right to colonies, the chance to levy endless tribute on the darker world,-on coolies in China, on starving peasants in India, on black savages in Africa, on dying South Sea Islanders, on Indians of the Amazon-all this and nothing more. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you and Happy New Year to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
