But for all of Caesar&amp;#39;s, Alexander the Great&amp;#39;s, and Richard the Lionheart&amp;#39;s faults, you do have to give them some credit for putting their own lives on the line to accomplish their goals. Each could easily have died in combat. They always had skin in the game, even if the game wasn&amp;#39;t particularly moral. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m curious how we evolved from the standard of the heroic general/monarch/emperor leading from the front, often at the head of a cavalry charge, to one who either stays behind the lines, directing the battle through messengers, or more recently, delegates battlefield command to subordinates while staying at a safe command post miles away, perhaps sending off telegrams or orders over radio when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
