  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was raised Shi&#39;ite*, so what I was taught growing up was that Ali was appointed the successor by Muhammad, but there was a coup by Umar and Abu Bakr after the Prophet&#39;s death, denying Ali his rightful inheritance, so to speak. And then after some time, the first Ummayad Caliph, Mu&#39;auiyah** killed Hussein (son of Ali, grandson of Muhammad, fourth Shi&#39;ite Imam) in the battle of Karbala, thereby sealing the schism &quot;with the blood of the Prophet&#39;s grandchildren&quot;, as it was dramatically put. Some more stuff happened in between and afterwards, but thats the gist of the Twelver Shi&#39;ite narrative as I understood it growing up.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there is the Sunni or orthodox narrative, which is much more common. From what I understand, the story goes: Muhammad dies, Abu Bakr gets elected Caliph; Abu Bakr appoints Umar as his successor, who is succeeded by Uthman, then Ali. After Ali, the Ummayads take over, and the rest is history. Or at least, there is some agreement between the two sects over the big picture after this point.</p>\n\n<p>So, to my main question: what&#39;s the historical explanation for all this? How do historians reconcile these two narratives? Or do they give more weight to the Sunni narrative, considering 90% of Muslims are Sunni? Most academic work I&#39;ve seen takes the latter position, which makes sense to me. Is this a correct understanding of the work being done in this field?</p>\n\n<p>Second, the way these narratives are told traditionally seems to me to emphasise the importance of personality, or morality, or some later religious or political position. In other words, these seem more like myths than historical sources. So what are the social, economic, and political causes for the schism?</p>\n\n<p>*I am no longer religious, but I mention this to explain my premise. Also, I mean Twelver Shi&#39;ite, or Ja&#39;afari Shi&#39;ite, who are the largest branch of Shi&#39;ites iirc.</p>\n\n<p>**I have no idea if this is the right transliteration.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
