Is reddits upvote system serviceable? Do you have another system you think would be better at promoting &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answers? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Bonus question in regards to the 20 year rule. This rule helps the forum sidestep a lot of questions that are quite political in nature (which is great). But would &lt;a href=\"/r/AskHistorians\"&gt;r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt; model work for a subreddit on e.g. Public Policy? Do you think such a topic would require very different forum rules?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
