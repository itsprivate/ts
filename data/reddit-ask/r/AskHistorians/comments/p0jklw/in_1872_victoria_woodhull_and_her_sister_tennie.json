Could they have returned home to their families?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also curious how two teen girls from Baltimore likely ended up at the French Ball to start with. What can we safely assume about them from their presence there?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been transcribing the story from the Nov 2, 1872 edition of Woodhull &amp; Claflin&#39;s Weekly, here&#39;s what is described (warning, its quite disturbing):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>....two young girls not more than fifteen or sixteen years of age. These girls had come on fresh from school in Baltimore...  </p>\n\n<p>...Wine was called for, and while the men drank but little, these young girls were plied with it, until I remonstrated and begged them not to drink any more. My effort to influence them was met with an insulting request from the men to let them alone.  </p>\n\n<p>You may be sure I followed these girls up, and got the history of their connection with these men. They were seduced by them. Two other young girls, friends of theirs, were invited on from Baltimore to visit in this best society. They were taken to the house of a woman we will call Molly, a first-class house of prostitution, when they were robbed of their innocence, each of these soundrels, Challis and “Smith” taking one to himself. And this scoundrel Challis, to prove that he had seduced a maiden, <em>carried for days on his finger, exhibiting in triumph, the red trophy of her virginity</em>. After a few days, these Lotharios exchanged beds and companions, and when weary of this they brought their friends, to the number of one hundred and over, to debauch these young girls—mere children.  </p>\n\n<p>...The children he has seduced and debauched have now no way open before than the prostitute’s road to hell. The way is open for him into the very heart of good society; the way for them is the way of the pariah, out into the wilderness of sin and shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A sub question is on the used of the verb and adjective &quot;debauch&quot; as in &quot;to debauch&quot; and &quot;debauched women.&quot; It seems sometimes it&#39;s used to denote rape and other times just to denote perhaps consensual but nonetheless extramarital sex, perhaps with sex workers?  e.g. from another passage:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...The very next box to the one in which we sat was used by two men at once for the purpose fo debauching debauched women; and the trustees of the Academy know this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there nuance to be gleaned from the differing uses as commonly understood at the time? Debauched to me, now, is maybe synonymous with hedonism, doesn&#39;t necessarily imply rape or nonconsent, but retains a kind of ironic hint of moral judgement.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
