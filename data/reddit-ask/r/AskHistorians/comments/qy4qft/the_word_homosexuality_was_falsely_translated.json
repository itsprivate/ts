Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,\n(I know this is ESV and not RSV. Will explain later).</p>\n\n<p>This was the first and only time the English word homosexuality has appeared in both the new and old testament. </p>\n\n<p>Once they released the RSV, a seminary student wrote to the head of the RSV translation team, Luther Allan Weigle, and told him that he thought they made a mistake translating that word. According to that student this Greek word is very rare and only appears in all Greek transcripts 100 times, and when it does it better translates to &quot;Sexual Pervert.&quot; Luther Weigle wrote back and agreed that they had made a mistake, but that he couldn&#39;t make any edits for ten years.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the RSV does use the word sexual pervert, but as the ESV version above shows and other versions of the bible show that word has stuck and hasn&#39;t gone away. </p>\n\n<p>Questions:\n1) I have been a Christian my whole life and never heard this story. Supposedly the Yale archives has these letters between the student and Luther Weigle. What&#39;s your take on this story? Is it accurate, did I miss anything or miss represent something?\n2) To the Greek scholars out there did they make a mistake translating that word? Not being a Greek scholar, how could I check this myself?\n3) If I wanted to see the primary sources of those letters between the student and Luther Weigle would I need to travel to Yale, or is there a way to check online?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
