I’m struggling to find words to discuss best practices on viewing historical figures, especially when there were contemporaries in that era that espoused modern values. Here are some exemplars:</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle argues on the natural order of slavery and how a rebellious slave has committed an offense against society. It’s easier to judge him as a moral person, an ethicist of his era, because it’s not as if there’s abolitionist voices of that era.</p>\n\n<p>When we speak of slavery of the modern era, there’s plenty of contemporary abolitionist voices, making it hard not to view those people through the mores of the modern era - we’re all abolitionists now.</p>\n\n<p>So I’m asking for some philosophical ideas from you, individually, on best practices for how to discuss the ethics and morals of behaviors of previous eras. </p>\n\n<p>Topics might include rape, war, non-sustainable extraction, cultural genocide, sex trafficking, violence, etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
