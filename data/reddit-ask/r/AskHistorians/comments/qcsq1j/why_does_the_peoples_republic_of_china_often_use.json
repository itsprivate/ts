My questions would be: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Did this start with the PRC, or is it an older habit? </li>\n<li>Is there some cultural/linguistic reason that this sort of formula has been adopted? </li>\n<li>Is this style commonly used by the ROC/Taiwan as well? </li>\n<li>And is there a name for this formula?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
