This post is my way to draw attention to this issue:\n\nTwo of the most popular recent posts on the subreddit seem to have what I would call a dubious premise:\n\nTopic 1: [How did tracksuits (especially the ones with stripes on their sides) become an inherent part of Russian/East Slavic culture?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ndpx06/how_did_tracksuits_especially_the_ones_with/)\nTopic 2: [Why didn't most people in Muslim-majority countries grow detached from religion like they often did in Christian-majority countries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nj60qb/why_didnt_most_people_in_muslimmajority_countries/)\n\nWhile I understand that I am not a source, the premise of Topic 1 seems very difficult to substantiate. How does OP know that Adidas is “inherent part” of Slavic culture? This question seems to be based on a popular meme that pokes fun at stereotypes about Eastern Europeans. The question in practice fails to see the difference between stereotypes, culture and current social facts. Frankly, suggesting that this stereotype is anything but an internet joke making fun of an old fashion trend felt unpleasantly dismissive.\n\nOf course the very educated answers in the thread focused on why the Adidas apparel brand was popular in the 90s - which is a fair approach to the history of that brand in Eastern Europe. At first I expected answers to mention the fact that the stereotype stated by OP as the “truth” may be faulty, but then I realised that people who answer may not be qualified to comment on or even spot the dubious premise. \n\nThe reason is that the premise is not historical but cultural or sociological. A historian is not expected to know the current cultural background of a country or a region, or a group of people. The question is historical but the premise is current. So historians, being focused on history, cannot say whether the premise is true or false. They just identify the topic and tell its history. \n\nTo give a more sinister example: OP may have asked why rape is a part of the culture of nation X. A historian has no way to tell whether rape currently plays any role in the culture of nation X but can tell what is the history of rape in that country. A historian is rarely equipped (nor is he expected to) to discuss the harmful stereotype portrayed as true in current popular discourse.\n\nOf course, when discussing tracksuits, the topic is lighthearted and fun, so no harm done - just raised eyebrows. When religion is involved, however, the stereotypes pushed in the premises of questions may be more troublesome\n\nTopic 2 - which is currently this sub’s top post - is much more worrying, as it reinforces what seems to be a harmful stereotype that the Muslim world is more religious and - as a result - as certain orange politicians would have you believe, not as “advanced”. It suggests that OP has collected data on religious attitudes and various group affiliations in the immensely huge “Muslim” world and reached the conclusion that Tunisians, for example, are more religious than Chileans. It is a premise that cannot be verified and just reinforces a stereotype. I know, again, that I am not a source but I know quite a lot of people from Muslim communities all over the world. None of them is overtly “religious”, while most are unabashed atheists. So a question I would ask in the subreddit would be “What made Muslim communities so atheistic compared to Orthodox Christian communities, which in my subjective experience, are extremely religious?”. I have no way of knowing how rampant atheism is in Muslim-majority countries - so my hypothetical question is as valid as today’s top thread in the sub. \n\nAs with the Adidas question, I do not expect actual historians to be in a position to refute the premise raised by OP. A historian is best equipped to identify the topic (development of religious attitudes in Muslim-majority countries through history) and write about this. A historian has no way of comparing current religious attitudes between, for example, Azerbaijan and Mongolia.\n\nMy point here is that some questions can reinforce harmful stereotypes - even if the asker and the replying historians have the best of intentions. While this is not exactly soapboxing, as there is no malicious intent, it is still a troubling issue.\n\nI am not sure how it can be addressed but I feel that it may pose serious problems to the sub down the road.\n\nThis is from me -hope this helps. \n\nTo the mods - keep up the good work, thank you very much for your work! To everybody else - keep giving those great questions and answers!",
