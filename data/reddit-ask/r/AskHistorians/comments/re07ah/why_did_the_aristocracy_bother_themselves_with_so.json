If you are a French nobleman in the late middle ages, your estate already provides you with plenty of food, entertainment, luxury, and the opportunity for a mistress or two or even a harem. Why wage war?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a pain in the backside. Some rulers spent most of their lives on the road going from one campaign to the next. Always managing quarreling commanders, military logistics, arduous terrain and various diseases one might get in army camps. Then you endure the stress of desertions, mutiny, and the actual combat part where you and some of your brothers and cousins might die, or you might get captured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why? Why bother? Especially easily defensible countries like Spain or England. Why bother yourself in terrible military campaigns in the pursuit of land gains your dumb ass heirs will probably squander in the future, when you can just lay back in your comfy castle with some wench washing your feet, quelling a peasant rebellion every once in a while and managing court drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
