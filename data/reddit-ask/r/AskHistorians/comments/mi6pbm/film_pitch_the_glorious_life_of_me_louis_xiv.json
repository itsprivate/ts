I have seen these movies about me, and they portray me oh so poorly. One focuses around my death, others trying to create lies out of my court. How about a grand movie about me from my own perspective?\n\nI began as a small child, suddenly ruling France at the age four. It was rough, my childhood. Growing up was brutal. I felt neglected, scared, yet I was the King. How dare the people treat me like that? Then at age nine, it got worse. A long civil war. I will never forgive Paris. \n\nOnce I was of age, I was a magnificent soldier on the battlefield. But I also fell in love, with the beautiful niece of Mazarin. It was a forbidden love, my dearest Marie. But as king, I could not pursue it, so I married Marie-Thérèse of Austria. This marriage secured the peace we needed with Spain. \n\nAfter Mazarin died, I truly began my reign. I swore that I would bear responsibility for the entire realm. This was my divine right, as King Louis XIV of France. Everything belonged to me. \n\nI made France beautiful. I supported the arts. I made France the most glorious place in Europe. No small detail escaped me. Look at the Palace of Versailles. It is proof of all my hard work at glory. I also have many children, and my heir, Louis, though he died before me, his son, Louis XV, long may he reign. I pray that my dynasty lives on. \n\nI also did start a few wars here and there, expanded French lands, but no need to focus on that. It seems I got carried away here. My film, my glorious film will be managed by me. It must show the struggle of a small boy, given the throne at the age of four, the pain he felt, to the glorious battlefield, to my forbidden love, to my dearest Palace of Versaille. I want my film to focus on me and my glory. \n\nAfter all, you have probably seen a portrait of me. I must be in charge of everything for my film. It is absolutely mine. Now that this \"film pitch\" is done, how is my dearest descendant King Louis XXV doing? ",
