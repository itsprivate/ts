The classic Hollywood trope was always that the Cowboys and Native Americans were constantly at each others throats, but even my basic level of research (and common sense) would suggest that any such fighting would have occured between the indigenous peoples and the US government, who were actively engaged in the genocide of Native Americans. Now I appreciate that the concept of a cowboy as depicted in movies/media etc. is very romanticised as is, but I&#39;m wondering if there was ever anything which could even be vaguely described as fitting a &quot;Cowboys vs Indians&quot; type of conflict, or if, as I suspect, any conflict would have been between Native Americans and the US Government and its allies.
