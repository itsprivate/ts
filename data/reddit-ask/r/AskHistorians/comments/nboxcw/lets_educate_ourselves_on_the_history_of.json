I'd like to build some kind of timeline based on these sources to put everything together in one place, so that anyone could dive into it to some depth.\n\nI am of jewish ancestry but I am an atheist. I live in Tel-Aviv, Israel.\n\nI was just reading the news and I am shocked, people are organizing in mobs and spread violence, jews chant \"death to all arabs\" and arabs chant \"death to all jews\".\nThe concept of hurting a random person, be it a jew or an arab, based on their race is mind boggling to me. I can't understand it.\n\nI never cared for politics and history and so I feel clueless, even though it's all happening under my nose. The internet is full of lies and given a text, I can't differentiate between truth and fiction. Parties with interesets take advantage of social platforms to spread disinformation. \nThe only thing I understand is that I hate racism and I want to  spread some common sense and make an impact.\n\nPlease help me educate myself on the subject.",
