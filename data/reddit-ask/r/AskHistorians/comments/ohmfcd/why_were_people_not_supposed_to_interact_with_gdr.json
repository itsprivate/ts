The video generally explains the procedure for crossing the Soviet and Alied checkpoints and what you should do in between, but something I found interesting was the repeated insistence throughout the entire video that you should not interact with GDR police or authorities in any way at all. They stress several times that if you are stopped or if an accident or breakdown happens, you should wait for either allied assistance or a Soviet soldier, but never under any circumstances to show any documents or provide any information to anyone representing the GDR. They even say you can pay road fines to Soviet officers but not GDR officers.</p>\n\n<p>My question is why is that? What was the effective difference between these two groups in the GDR? If the Soviets had the same (or greater) control, then why was there any difference between giving information to the Soviets vs giving information to the GDR?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. This is the video in question: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QS1xvtLV8Xw\">https://youtu.be/QS1xvtLV8Xw</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
