Even using hot irons to blind 500 people/hour would still take over 30 hours.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why did the Bulgars just hang out and wait to be blinded? 15,000 soldiers is an entire field army. Even half that number is a capable fighting force. Why would they sit and wait to be blinded, rather than fight to escape? Surely they were not all captured and disarmed, and even if they were, 15,000 is a lot of people to control.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is it more likely it is a fake story of mass blinding was meant to sow fear among the Bulgars?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
