This struck me as a little surprising, since I could easily imagine that a single campaign would involve multiple pitched battles, to say nothing of the long skirmishes, sieges, and harassment of enemy/local forces that would be 90% of the time spent campaigning.\n\nSo here's a long multi-part question, specifically regarding around late 1100s to late 1400s:\n\n1. How exactly do you define a pitched battle? What draws the line between pitched battle and a skirmish?\n2. How many would campaigns an average men-at-arms/semi-professional soldier be called upon in their career?\n3. How many pitched battles, sieges, skirmishes, etc each would a campaign consist of?\n6. How did all of the above vary across region and time, and war? I would imagine most conflicts were mostly 'lets gather a few thousand men and loot some towns/villages', but a long campaign to reclaim Jerusalem or later when the Italian wars rolled around seems very different to me.\n\nBonus: all roads lead to Rome, so how many battles would a professional soldier of ~200 AD Rome see in their career?",
