By today&amp;#39;s standards, the level of physical discipline against children was very high - but what counted as &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;severe&amp;quot; for the time? Was there a level of punishment which would be alarming to other people or a cause for concern - for example if a parent beating a child left long-term marks or permanent scarring, would be that considered &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Related, would it be unusual for physical punishments to continue into teenagerhood/adulthood? Would a lord beat  a squire, for example, or an older child (if they remained in the parental household?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read varying sources that claim either it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as popular history makes out, or that it really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that bad, and children were beaten by parents and teachers rather mercilessly. Which is correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
