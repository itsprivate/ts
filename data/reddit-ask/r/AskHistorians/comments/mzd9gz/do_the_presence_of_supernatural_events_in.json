He is not a mythicist but he thinks the existence of Jesus is no better than a coin flip. He makes two arguments (1) that we cannot trust the testimony of the Gospels regarding the miracles attributed to Jesus due to Hume's arguments against miracles and (2) miracle accounts contaminates the entire narrative and should cause one to doubt the other parts of the narrative. If we only have the narrative which includes a miraculous account to prove the existence of someone then we dont have good evidence they exist. If this was applied throughout history, which other figures which we think exist would we no longer be able to say exist? Is this too high of a standard. \n\nSide note: Stephen Law also doubts the authenticity of Tacitus and Josephus' works.  He view's the claims of Josephus as made by Christian editors, possibly whole cloth. Tacitus and Josephus only knew Jesus existed due to the claims of Christians so they aren't trustworthy sources for Jesus' existence.",
