Im wondering whether the same or something similar has happened in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: It seems my question is misunderstandable.\nI am not arguing that whether Japan (or any other nation for that matter) should’ve apologised because thats beside the point. I am asking whether they have been held responsible by the Allied Forces as a nation who lost the war (like Nazi Germany) and if not what could be the possible reasons. My theory is that (as one comment pointed out) the events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were such overkill on the part of the US that it put Japan into a sort of victimised position and overshadowed the atrocities committed by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
