Sadly earlier this year the older son, S, was kidnapped by their self proclaimed nazi father. While he had S, he convinced the kid that he is; not half honduran, that he is fully white and german, that ballet is gay, that being gay is wrong, and introduced him to tons of youtube videos about the nazi military complex during ww2. now, months later, S is finally back with his mother and has been blasting nazi marching music, talking about the master race, and other stuff glorifying nazi's. He is about 11 years old and very bright. This is all a huge shift to how he was before the kidnapping. His mother has taking him to therapy and she has asked me to help get him into other history stuff to help curtail this behavior. My question is could you guys recommend some reading or videos on honduras culture? As well as other interesting time periods to help shift his interest? Anything is appreciated. \n\nEdit: thought of this right after making the post, I'm also going to be going over nazi's with him in a ww2 context to help curb the wehraboo type statements from him. As someone commented, I definitely agree surpressing him wanting to learn about it is a bad idea. Better to help educate him on the truth of the matter. \n\nTldr: friends kid was kidnapped by a nazi and was indoctrinated, need other history to help shift his interest.",
