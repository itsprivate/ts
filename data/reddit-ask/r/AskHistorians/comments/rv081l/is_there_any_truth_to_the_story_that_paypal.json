  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard semi-knowledgable people state that PayPal effectively sourced a substantial portion of its early funds by accepting payments from customers, but then would not pass on the funds to the recipients. The idea was that targeted users would be given &amp;#39;payment error&amp;#39; notices that implied that the payment was lost somewhere, and then PayPal would simply put them through a slow bureaucratic process with the aim of leaving them to simply give up while PayPal would look for the transaction. This was supposedly not the majority of payments, but was a &amp;#39;significant number&amp;#39; constituting a modest revenue stream for the startup from 1998-2002. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If true, why have they avoided charges for what would seem to be a massively corrupt practice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If false, I&amp;#39;d still like to get reading recommendations for reliable tech histories from this era.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people I&amp;#39;ve spoken to basically make the claim that this the obvious goal of the transaction failure problems that apparently plagued PayPal in its early days, but the distinction around both intent and planning seems important. It&amp;#39;s a good explanation, but I don&amp;#39;t know if I should be accepting it, simply because I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the period. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried to do my own research into this, but the majority of sources on PayPal that I could find are simply fawning over the notion of a successful entrepreneurial startup, to the point of fiction. In many cases they are getting information incorrect that is available on Wikipedia. I&amp;#39;ve tried other more academic works or insider histories, but the academic works don&amp;#39;t seem to cover this, and I couldn&amp;#39;t find any insider pieces that seemed ready to spill the beans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
