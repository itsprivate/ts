Without these purveyors of the past, these archivists of antiquity, these reporters of the ancient record, half the population of the redditverse might puff out of existence with the snap of a finger. Today, three more heroes of history have joined the ranks of the Avengers of History!

With the Space Stone, this mod will shape the subreddit into an even more glorious form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behold! &lt;a href=\"/u/J-Force\"&gt;u/J-Force&lt;/a&gt; delves into the heart of users and ensures that their ways are pure of motive.

As they join the Avengers of History, they will increase their power until no number of META posts calling for an “answered” flair will remain. They will lead us into a brave new world in which all posters use the search function and review the FAQ before asking “Did Japan surrender because of nukes or the Soviets?” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heroes walk in Reddit. What a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is time to party!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
