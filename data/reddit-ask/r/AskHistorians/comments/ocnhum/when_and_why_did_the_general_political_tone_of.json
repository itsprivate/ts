Steve Earle, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, John Prine, all were considered pioneers of progressivism and at least one was a self-declared socialist. However modern country music seems to be overwhelmed by the “America fuck yeah” type of country, thinking Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, etc. While left-leaning country still exists (Jason Isbell and Steve Earle for example), it seems like there’s been a tone shift between 1960 and today. Why is that, and when did the shift occur? If I had to guess I’d say around 9/11 so I don’t think this violates rule 8.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
