How would troops be moved into these areas to maintain their control and in what way were the people in those enclaves beholden to this far away government? Basically, I&#39;m asking why did these enclaved states not just split off and join the larger states that surrounded them, and why the those larger states not at least take them by force?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
