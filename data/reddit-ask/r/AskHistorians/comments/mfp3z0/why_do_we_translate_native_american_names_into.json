I'm unsure but I think it means 'Helpful', they didn't go all the way and become the Mounthelpful family).\n\n\n\nSo, why Sitting Bull instead of Tatanka Iyotake? Why Crazy Horse instead of Tasunke Witko? Why Little Turtle instead of Mihsihkinaahkwa? When a Japanese name, I would leave as, Eg, Okada Kazuchika, and not translate as Peaceful Reality of the Rice Paddy Ridge. You can't say the American names simply look strange and alien because that's true of any name of any naming convention that you aren't a part of. Bojana is a girl's name most people aren't familiar with, but you wouldn't translate it, and besides, you wouldn't translate Rebecca, though I am just as ignorant of the meaning of Rebecca as I am of Bojana. I wouldn't translate either, the idea of doing so would be very strange, but we all do this with Native American names. Why?\n\n\nI would assume the answer may be as simple as a lack of family names, but mononymity isn't unique to American cultures I don't think? Besides I've never seen anyone refer to the famous Greek philosopher Best Purpose, who was a student of Broad Shoulders (Aristotle and Plato).",
