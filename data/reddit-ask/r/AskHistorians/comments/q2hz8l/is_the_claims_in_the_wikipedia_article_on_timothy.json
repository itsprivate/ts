Basically as the video and Wikipedia article will explain in more detail, Dexter was a fool who married rich and always fell for the bad advice of other businessmen to &quot;ship coals to Newcastle&quot;, heating pans to the Carribbean and collected worthless continental dollars and whale bones, always to end up making a profit through a ridiculous contrivance.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds like tall tales to me.</p>\n\n<p>Now Dexter was a real life eccentric and his ridiculously misspelled book &quot;a pickle for the knowing ones&quot; was real, that much I&#39;ve understood. And even if much of it is unproven I&#39;ll still likely move ahead with a draft of the play. Still, I&#39;d like to know where I stand as far as evidence goes. Therefore I ask for your help to find if there are any concrete proofs anywhere for these crazy business ventures.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
