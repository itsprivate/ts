Was it a rising tension throughout the whole continent that then became a spontanious chain reaction sparked in Sicily that just per chance happened in 1848?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a bonus question - Was it a coincidence that all of these events happened in a single year? Was there some kind of coordination between at least some of these revolutionists that made all of these revolutions happen in a single year? Or are we just cherry picking dates and the whole concept of &amp;quot;Year of Revolutions&amp;quot; is a misconception?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
