  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read several accounts of what the diet of enslaved Africans in the United States was like. It varied by region — rice based in rice-growing areas. Corn-based elsewhere. They were often allowed to garden, and their diet included leafy greens, beans, watermelons, and a mix of other veggies and wild-caught fish (if they had a stream nearby). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there seems to be disagreement among historians about the diet beyond that. Some claim that a slave working in the fields on a plantation was well fed because they were expensive investments that had to be maintained, and so ate 3500-4500 calories a day, though the food was pretty basic and often not of the best quality. These diets were probably nutritionally adequate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others says that they were lucky to get 1,800 calories a day from cornmeal and pork fat. I find figures like that unlikely — I&amp;#39;ve done heavy labor on a farm, and I lost weight eating 3,000 calories a day. You&amp;#39;d quickly have a slave who couldn&amp;#39;t work if you only fed them 1,800 calories a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do we really not know how plantation owners thought about providing food for slaves? I&amp;#39;m sure there was variation. But there must have been something of a standard approach to make sure the slaves didn&amp;#39;t quickly become decimated by malnutrition/weight loss. Why is there widespread disagreement among historians?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
