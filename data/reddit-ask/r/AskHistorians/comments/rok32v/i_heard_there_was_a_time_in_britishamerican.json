[...] Interestingly, the sex ideas of the Victorian era (which has extended into modern days) was reversed. Males were considered closer to God and thus would easier be able to resist sexual desire while women were considered more animal-like in their sexual desire and thus more excusable if they were unable to resist their desires to sin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought the Victorian era was the time when these sex beliefs were reversed? That&amp;#39;s when Freud invented &amp;quot;hysteria&amp;quot;, claiming that women were so horny and obsessed with &amp;quot;penis envy&amp;quot; that they invented family sexual abuse to satisfy themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
