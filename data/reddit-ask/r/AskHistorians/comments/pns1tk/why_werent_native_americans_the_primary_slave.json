However why is it that the primary enslaved population in the Americas were African? From both an economic and convenience perspective it seems odd that people from Europe would travel to Africa to then travel to America and produce crops to then... send back to Europe? Or at least send the profits back. Why not just enslave other Europeans? Or only bring African slaves to Europe, rather than risk the financial and human loss of transporting then to a tertiary location even farther away? Even simpler, why not just conquer Africa and grow the crops there? Certainly that was already happening, so why take all these extra steps? There are some obvious factors I&#39;m missing here, any explanation that can shed some more light on the economics of colonialism would be appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
