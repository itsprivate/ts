I remember I was first allowed one bottle of beer on special occasions when I was 14, and by 16 I could pretty much share really whatever my Dad was having in an evening, with how much I could have depending of course on how strong it was and how much he wanted to drink it. But as an adult now, I have spend a considerable time in different parts of America, and the attitude to drinking is completely different. Of course, there’s the legal aspect of Americans needing to be 21 to publicly drink and buy alcohol and us 18, but also how fully grown adults treat it. I was stunned when I heard someone call another an alcoholic after 3 glasses of wine with dinner, when in England you’d still be driving home after that. And it’s made me wonder is this a direct result of Prohibition and alcohol being treated as something evil that has just stuck around through the generations?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
