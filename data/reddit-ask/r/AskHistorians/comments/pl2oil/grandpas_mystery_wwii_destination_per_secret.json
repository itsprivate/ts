  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My grandfather passed away at 101+ yrs old, and never found out the answer to what is, on the face, a simple question: what was secret destination 1609-A?</p>\n\n<p>He left behind an autobiography which contains a lit of great first-hand accounts of his time in the military as a fighter pilot and gunnery instructor. I&#39;d love to publish it in the public domain at some point, but that&#39;s another topic.</p>\n\n<p>He was Army Air Corps, and his group was supposed to go to the east coast to fly a relatively new-to-him plane off carriers and watch for U-boats. However, some of his guys (him included) didn&#39;t have the requisite number of hours on the plane, so they were left behind. They eventually got bored and felt underutilized in the war effort, so they bugged a general by phone. That general got them stationed somewhere else, but they were still flying a meager selection of training aircraft at that air field to keep their skills sharp. Their change of station took them closer to the general, so they decided to pay him a visit in person and really make their case.</p>\n\n<p>The general arranged for them to follow special orders on mission &quot;1609-A,&quot; marked SECRET. This may have been a wild goose chase (I wonder how much the general liked the pestering), but maybe it was an important mission. Grandpa writes he did not know the actual destination. Just that they needed to start in Presque Isle, ME, the jumping-off point for destinations further east (Europe).</p>\n\n<p>Upon arriving in Iceland, presumably on the way to somewhere in mainland Europe, some officer pulled rank and had my grandfather and his crew relieve exhausted pilots that had been chasing Nazi planes out of Icelandic skies for quite some time. After a rather miserable year in Iceland, shooing Germans away with no real action, the crew returned stateside.</p>\n\n<p>Grandpa never learned what 1609-A was about.</p>\n\n<p>This far past those events, I imagine such orders are declassified and public record. If so, where would I go to search for answers? I have the name and location of where the orders (the 1pg extract relevant to my grandfather and his crew, anyway). Searches based on names and locations haven&#39;t yet turned anything up. Nor has the mystery designator &quot;1609-A.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>References to better places to look, museums/docents/librarians/archives to consult, or to someone with excellent research skills would be very much appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I can share further details from the orders extract if that would be helpful. Are such things, in fact, no longer &quot;secret&quot; this far in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any leads!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
