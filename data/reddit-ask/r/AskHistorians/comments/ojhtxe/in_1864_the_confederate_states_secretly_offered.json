Benjamin agreed to send Duncan F. Kenner to Europe, to negotiate diplomatic recognition and material support from the UK and France in exchange for the abolition of slavery. Kenner&#39;s mission failed, partly because by the time he got to Europe the Confederacy&#39;s military situation had become truly hopeless (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4232057\">source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now for the question: if the Confederates had seceded in order to preserve slavery in the first place, why would they agree to abolish it to prevent their reabsorption into the Union? I haven&#39;t found any sources directly addressing this.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some hypotheses I have thought of:\n1. They feared that abolition on Northern terms would be less favourable than on their own terms (i.e. compensated vs uncompensated emancipation);\n2. They were afraid of Northern reconstruction (maybe they were fine with abolishing slavery but not with granting African Americans civil rights);\n3. Maybe they were concerned about personal (criminal) consequences for themselves;\n4. Maybe their stubbornness and sense of pride led them to take desperate measures to avoid defeat at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>But these are all conjectures of mine. Does anyone have a documented reason for why the Confederacy would abandon the very cause of its existence to secure its continued existence?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
