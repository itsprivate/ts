Several hundred children of both sexes form part of the ballet and it is just a great center for prostitution. Two or three days after I arrived in Naples, someone latched onto me in Carlo square and insisted on showing me &#39;really interesting&#39; things. [...]  </p>\n\n<p>&#39;I&#39;ll take you to a very decent family, <em>una famiglia onestissima</em>, well-of people, <em>gente dabbene veramente</em>. They have two little girls you can see and touch naked - but not sleep with unless you have a specially arrangement with the parents.&#39; [...]</p>\n\n<p>The mother came out to &#39;demonstrate&#39;. She raised the price, said the pimp had got it wrong and then called in the little girls. Their brazen looks showed me they were anything but new to the game. That quieted my conscience a little. [...] Who can tell what the result would be for me, particularly in a city like Naples, where the authorities are often hand-in-glove with criminals, where the police clearly connive with traffickers in human flesh? So let&#39;s have a moment of pleasure which does no one any harm anyway! It&#39;s not up to the me to redeem the Babylon of Italy.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
