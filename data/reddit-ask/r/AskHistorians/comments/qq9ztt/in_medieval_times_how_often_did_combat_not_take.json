And it seems like the more deeply you dive into it the more often you come across instances where both sides showed up and made a whole thing about acting aggressive and then whatever the quarrel was would be resolved by the rulers on the field.  </p>\n\n<p>Specifically there was a lot of that with William the Conqueror and various lords that would go home, raise a rebel army, meet William’s army on the field, and then they bend the knee and go back to status quo.  And one notable example (if I’m remembering correctly without re-googling) was that the “battle” that determined Portugal’s sovereignty as it’s own kingdom was “fought” between the armies of 2 cousins named Alfonso, where there was apparently no causalities and it was basically just a tournament and it was resolved amicably?  I get that they were in the middle of reconquestadoring the peninsula and didn’t want to wipe each other other out with infighting… but was that kind of the how things were expected to go, particularly when it came to what often amounted to family squabbles? </p>\n\n<p>If I was a random dude in 1068 England and my lord Morcar just called me up to serve in his rebel army against William and we are marching towards London, is my expectation that William will march his army out, we’ll stand on opposite sides of a field for awhile, and then Morcar will do a mulligan on the whole thing and everyone goes home with whatever problem resolved?  Or would I be fully anticipating ride-or-die combat where the losing side gets cut down and wiped out in retreat?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
