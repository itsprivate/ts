I stated that they must’ve used multiple layers or some kind of protection(wood panels or something to block the air and water) from the wind and sea. But my friend questions how effective clothing could be once it got exposed to the frigid seas in the Northern hemisphere where the Vikings roamed. As well as how much protection they could’ve realistically had on their boats based on all the pictures of their boats being pretty open and exposed. So how did the Vikings fight the elements at sea?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
