Unfortunately, when he came home he didn't speak much about it - this means that most of his experiences died with him. I have three photos, likely taken at an army barracks. In one, he's atop his horse and the other two feature him posing on his own and with his squad. Unfortunately, as they were taken circa 1914 the picture quality isn't great. I've tried my best to create high quality scans but there's little I can do for pictures that weren't preserved very well. \n\nOur family has lived in the north of Ireland (now Northern Ireland) for as long as I can trace my lineage back. He was born in either Fermanagh or Antrim, and his family were Protestant. His surname was Campbell and he was 18-19 in 1914. He most likely fought with the 36th Ulster Brigade as a mounted troop, although an insignia on his cap infers that he might have had a different role during the war. \n\n[The pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/o1Oxv1U)\n\nAny more info as to his involvement in the war would be greatly appreciated.",
