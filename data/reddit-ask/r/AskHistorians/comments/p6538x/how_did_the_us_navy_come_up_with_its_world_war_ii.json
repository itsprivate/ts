Even things like hospital ships tended to be named after virtues (like <em>Hope</em> and <em>Mercy</em>). Of course even the Cold War navy didn&#39;t have many of these classes of ships, so it seems like the convention was abandoned, but...how did it get so comprehensive in the first place? Did anyone figure they&#39;d run out of a certain type of name? Was there an official memo or something to stop the practice?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
