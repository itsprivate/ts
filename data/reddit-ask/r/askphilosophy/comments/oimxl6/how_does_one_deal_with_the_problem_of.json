But then I think that&#39;s no surprise: I just read a book-length treatment on it, while having limited exposure to the whole debate outside of that. Of course if a professional has the opportunity to present me their point of view for 300 pages without anyone interrupting them, this is going to be the most substantial take on the issue I&#39;ve heard so far. </p>\n\n<p>Then this whole story seems to continue. Whenever I keep reading and keep diving into the topic, I almost always switch to whatever I&#39;ve read last, in as far as it&#39;s a response to something I read previously. Like, </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why A is true. </p>\n\n<p>Me: I agree, that was convincing.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why A is false and B is true. </p>\n\n<p>Me: Right, that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>No, actually this doesn&#39;t work, see the next 200 pages for why.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yeah, that totally doesn&#39;t work.</p>\n\n<p>This way I feel like my convictions are just contingent on a time line along my reading habits. But it&#39;s also difficult to imagine something else happening while I&#39;m reasonable: As a novice, I&#39;ll probably not refute an expert ad hoc, after being confronted with their best arguments.  How to go about this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
