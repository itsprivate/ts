This is super exciting and I'm grateful for that opportunity :) For those not familiar with the competition, both the national olympiad and the international olympiad require students to write a text in English discussing one of four quotes.\n\nNow, English is my second language and all of my philosophy education thus far, except for some individual reading, has all been in Dutch. I think I'm a fairly competent writer overall, but translating the philosophies to English is a bit hard for me because of the amount of jargon that's used. I guess I mostly think about this stuff in Dutch so my English representation of some ideas is lacking/not really good. That's why I'd like to explore some of the ideas as they are described in English to get used the \"peculiar\" (in a positive way) writing style used in philosophy as well as expand my knowledge about philosophy with some more in-depth material than we usually discuss in my high school class. So basically I think I'm looking for an undergraduate level textbook that covers some of the most influential philosophers. I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for a good book or maybe some resources that could be helpful.\n\nThanks!",
