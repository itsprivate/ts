Any decision we make is influenced by factors out of our control. Can someone knowledgeable help me understand why most philosophers believe in it? This is an appeal to authority but: a psychology lecturer from Stanford came to our college and explained this in detail, with him saying with conviction that it is impossible for free will to exist and that it&#39;s an illusion. He said that everything in our life is determined by our parents, as they give us their genetics and dictate our environment.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
