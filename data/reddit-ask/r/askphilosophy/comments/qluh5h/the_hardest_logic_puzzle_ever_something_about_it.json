When the guru states she can see someone with blue eyes, the blue eyed person can immediately identify themselves as that person and leaves the island that night.</p>\n\n<p>(Inductive step) Assume it is true that if you had N people with blue eyes, and any amount of people with brown eyes, that the people with blue eyes would leave on night N.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the case where you have N+1 people with blue eyes and any amount with brown eyes.  Let x be any of the N+1 with blue eyes.  They are able to see N people with blue eyes.  However, after night N, the N people they can see do not leave.  Using the assumption, they can deduce that there are not N people with blue eyes, but N+1, meaning they must have blue eyes.  So they leave night N+1.</p>\n\n<p>This is sufficient to prove that everyone with blue eyes leaves after an amount of nights equal to the amount of people with blue eyes.  This is all well and good, until you think more deeply about it: <strong>what the guru says is a statement that is already obviously true to everyone</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s where this starts to get weird.  How is it possible that stating something obviously true could lead to a nonobvious conclusion about the state of the world?</p>\n\n<p>Because note this: the inductive step is true regardless of whether the guru speaks.  It&#39;s plainly true to the hyper-logical people in the statement of the problem.  What&#39;s important for the guru speaking is only <em>how it would effect the N=1 case</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What this seems to imply is that the fact the statement &quot;I can see someone with blue eyes&quot; <em>could</em> have contained non-obvious truth in some alternative version of reality, that it somehow translates to non-obvious truth in this one, even though it&#39;s obvious truth in this reality.  But that seems.. very strange??</p>\n\n<p>Please help!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
