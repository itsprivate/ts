I recall my parents attempt to shelter me from pop-media because, according to their view of the world, pop-culture narrative prevalent in media exercised no restraint ridiculing politicians, conflating success with greed, painting cops as squares, or otherwise encouraging alternate modes of thought from old-fashioned ideas. It's probably apparent that my parents were deeply conservative. Still, I would hardly call their worldview and the entire Trump camp the product of apathy.\n\nI think there is deeper evidence against Chomsky's assertion that narratives are systematically controlled in the mere existence of Q-Anon.
