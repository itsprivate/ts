I do, however, still believe that something in the line of reincarnation would be possible because we all exist in the first place. Why would my existence not be repeated?

How can we get a scientific analysis of consciousness?</p>\n\n<p>I find it hard to believe that trillions of molecular configurations gave rise to &quot;me&quot;. Sure, it all started at a basic level. A basic interpretation of light, sound and other types of sensory inputs. This then probably got encompassed by a set of behaviours that were predictable based on the input, and those behaviours were simply a complex network of interactions (electrical, biochemical etc that have different effects). Then a whole lot of complexities that would eventually be us, simplified described. </p>\n\n<p>My point is, I find it hard to believe that after life, everything will be &quot;black&quot;. There will be no &quot;me&quot;. No awareness of anything. No place in space and time. Just nothing. There has to be something maybe?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
