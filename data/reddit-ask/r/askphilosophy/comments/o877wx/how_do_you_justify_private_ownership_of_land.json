  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I understand the concept of private ownership when it comes to artifacts like a house, a bicycle etc. Someone has put in the work to gather the materials and create the artifact, so naturally they have a claim to ownership of that artifact. The creator is the owner and if they so choose they can transfer that ownership to another person by sale or gift.</p>\n\n<p>But with land, it is a different story as no human can claim to have created it. The land on our planet has always been there, even long before humans settled down. So how can any one person justify owning it, claiming exclusive rights and even forbidding others to walk on it?</p>\n\n<p>If you ask present-day landowners how they justify their ownership, they will likely give you one of the following answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I got it from someone else through purchase, inheritance or as a gift.</li>\n<li>I took it from someone else with violent means.</li>\n<li>I was there first and just claimed it for myself.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now if you think about it, 1) and 2) are ultimately the same as 3), because in 1) and 2) the followup question needs to be how the previous owner got it, and then again the previous owner to that one, and so on. Eventually you will reach the end of this list of previous owners and you end up with the scenario 3) where someone just claimed it.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that there is no other way to justify a person&#39;s ownership of land except to say that they were there first, said &quot;This is mine now!&quot; and then fought off everybody who challenged them.</p>\n\n<p>Isn&#39;t that an extremely weak justification for such an exclusive right?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
