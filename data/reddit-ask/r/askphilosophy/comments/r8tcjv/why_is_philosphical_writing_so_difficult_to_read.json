For example, in the Second Formulation of the Categorial Imperative, it commonly refers to the phrase, &amp;quot;treating someone as an ends.&amp;quot; I instantly thought; &amp;quot;okay, in what way are you USING that word???&amp;quot; NOWHERE in the writing does it actually break down the usage of the word &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; in this case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By making the reader assume an understanding of phrases and words up to their own interpretation in philosophical writing, you lose all clarity to make a decent decision as a result. I apologize if it seems like I&amp;#39;m bashing philosophy, but I wanted to see if anyone else had these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
