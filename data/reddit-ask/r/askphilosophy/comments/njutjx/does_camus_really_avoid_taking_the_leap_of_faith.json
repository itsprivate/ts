In other words, live a life rich in as much experience as possible.\n\nWhat is glaring to me, is that Camus seems to be smuggling in a subjective meaning of life here. The implied argument seems to be: *the meaning of life is to revolt against its meaninglessness*. I'm having trouble seeing how he differs from other existentialists he criticizes as taking the Leap of Faith. Perhaps I am missing something? I would appreciate you folks' input on this. \n\nThanks!\n\nedit: spelling",
