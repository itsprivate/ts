How do people bring themselves to care about moral philosophy if they don't believe it's universal? Is it to keep order? But that's what law is for(I think that morals are for human survival and law, for order). I understand that some moral philosophers may be fuelled by religious morals, so I ask all moral philosophers who think that morals are a survival construct.
