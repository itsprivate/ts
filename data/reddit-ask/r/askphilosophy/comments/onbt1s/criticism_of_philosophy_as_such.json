And when presented with scenarios and theoretical arguments, his basic reply was essentially: &quot;let&#39;s look at this world, rather than a dream world&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This echoes my feelings when philosophical arguments become too abstract/hypothetical/theoretical/detached from the physical conditions we face. I hope this doesn&#39;t sound too anti-intellectual. Are there any good critiques that are well thought out and aren&#39;t just anti-intellectual ranting? Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
