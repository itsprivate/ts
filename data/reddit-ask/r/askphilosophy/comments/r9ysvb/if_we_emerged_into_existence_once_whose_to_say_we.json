So how do we know that 13 billion years after my death another instance of my consciousness could rise again? This is from a scientific perspective not religious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To expand on this thought, maybe the reason we don’t remember our past lives is because we simply don’t have that body and it’s experiences anymore, but what we do retain is the deep down inner “you” that is behinds your thoughts, which is only experiencing the “now”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
