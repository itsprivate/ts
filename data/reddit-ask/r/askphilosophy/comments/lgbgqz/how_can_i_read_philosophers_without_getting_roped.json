I want to fall for philosophers that are closer to the truth then others, whom seem to have a better understanding of our world then others. But I am so dumb in that I fall for the wrong philosophers constantly and dont use my intelligence and my understanding of philosophers/philosophy to see the issues of philosophers I like with my own mind instead of relying on those smarter then me. I dont know, some advice would be great, I really want to get into this subject while not losing my grip on reality (if I ever had one)",
