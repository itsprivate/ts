Therefore, trying to solve problems caused by capitalism within the framework of capitalism seems unproductive. Surely the most effective method of creating change would be to change the very system which causes these problems? Considering Singer is a Utilitarian, I struggle to understand why he favours individual action which I don&#39;t believe will make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I have misunderstood Singer, I just struggle to reconcile his consequentialist viewpoint with his focus on individual action and was wondering if I have missed something in Singer&#39;s argument, or if anyone can provide an answer?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
