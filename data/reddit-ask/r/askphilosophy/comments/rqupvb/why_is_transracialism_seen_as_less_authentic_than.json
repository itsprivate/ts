Many of those who claim transracial identities undergo surgery to look more like the race they identify with, it is obviously very important to them. The case is often made that we should refer to trans people by their preferred pronouns as not doing so can negatively impact their mental health. If it were the case that not respecting transracial peoples identities would have a negative effect on their wellbeing then I fail to see why theres a difference. The only argument I’ve really heard against transracialism is that race is a lived experience, therefore someone who was born as white British cannot truly know what it’s like to be Korean. Switch out “white British” to “man” and “Korean” to “woman” and it’s the same argument trans exclusionary feminists use as far as I can tell. I’m certain I haven’t heard all the arguments either way and my mind is far from being made, looking forward to an interesting discussion below. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
