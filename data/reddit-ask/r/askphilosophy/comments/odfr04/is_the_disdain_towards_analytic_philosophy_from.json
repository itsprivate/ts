It seems to me that almost all of them have a certain disdain for analytic philosophy, maybe more than vice versa from contemporary analytic philosophers who are more charitable. The criticisms usually are analytic philosophy does not understand the human condition, trivialises important things as games, doesn&#39;t understand the history and the language required, inadequately approaches complex topics etc. (An example my friend gives is the Moorean shift; it&#39;s just a language game that doesn&#39;t convince anyone who don&#39;t already accept the conclusion).</p>\n\n<p>Now I do recognise that this is probably a reaction to analytic philosophy championing itself as superior towards most of the 20th century, but analytic philosophy has changed a lot from the 20th century to today (especially after the downfall of positivism).  Are continental philosophers not aware of the progress made in analytic tradition? Is there more to this than just posturing?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
