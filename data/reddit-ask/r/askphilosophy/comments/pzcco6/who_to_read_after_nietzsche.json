Actively is in quotes because he and his family are reliant on the state and resources/ appointments are limited especially now that he legally an adult.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kindness and responses!

These next few years will likely be the hardest of his life as he will have little access to child &amp; family services but is still too young to be safely prescibed antidepressants.
