I once dreamed of getting a PhD in the subject, but I can&#39;t afford the time, money, or opportunity cost of doing so -- too busy surviving by other means. Despite that, in my free time I&#39;ve continued studying to the extent I can, and writing a book on the subject as a hobby, with no particular intent to sell it or try to get professional journals to publish it or anything like that. I more or less finished it in 2019, though I&#39;ve continued polishing it up since then.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when I do a hobby project of some kind, I share it with other hobbyists with similar interests, usually some of whom have at least similar if not superior skill levels. I&#39;ve tried doing that with this project as well, but it seems like I fall into some weird limbo space between lay philosophy enthusiasts and actual professionals in the field that makes that not work out so well.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my attempts to get any feedback from amateur places on the internet have gotten very little response at all, and the little feedback I have gotten has mostly been either people saying they don&#39;t understand it or it&#39;s over their heads, or else people who seem to think they understand it but clearly don&#39;t because their counter-arguments usually aren&#39;t attacking my actual positions.</p>\n\n<p>A few people have given very positive responses, some even asking where they can buy it / suggesting I should publish it. But I would feel very uncomfortable trying to sell something the quality of which I am very unsure of because I haven&#39;t been able to run it past anyone who seems like a good sounding board.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m fairly sure that no professional journal would even consider *actual* peer review, by real professionals, of something written by a nobody on the internet like me, who is not really their peer.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m left wondering, what&#39;s an educated amateur to do to get some kind of sanity check on his work by people of at least a similar competency, without having to become an actual professional with a PhD first?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
