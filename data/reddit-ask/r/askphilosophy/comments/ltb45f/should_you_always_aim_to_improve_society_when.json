I have to pity others so I can at least think I am doing something right living the most moral life I can. Throughout my entire life I thought of the betterment of others in every little way possible, and yet few people I know have actually given me any thought.\n\nEvery day it seems like a Brave New World where deceitful evil prospers under facades while the ignorant take life as it is with the only hope of peace.
