Forced to wake before I'm ready; forced to rush when I just want to sit and enjoy a coffee; forced to sit when all I want is to walk; forced to be inside when I want to be in the sunshine; forced to spend time and energy on activities I do not care about at the expense of activities I do care about -- playing music, reading, hiking, visiting loved ones, etc. And this lasts for ten hours each workday if you include the commute (for which I don't get paid). But that doesn't seem accurate, because often the tiredness I acquire throughout the workday spills over into my leisure time, so that -- because of work -- I don't have the energy to play music, read, etc. Not to mention the time I have to spend on job applications, career consultations, etc. so I can get paid better for this crap. And this happens nearly every day, nearly every week, every month, every year. It feels like a form of servitude, and yet everyone around me thinks it's great and in fact boast about doing overtime or devoting their leisure time to work-related stuff. I have the very powerful sense that all this is deeply, deeply wrong. I would love to get recommendations for philosophers who have criticised work so I can understand better why I have this powerful feeling against work.",
