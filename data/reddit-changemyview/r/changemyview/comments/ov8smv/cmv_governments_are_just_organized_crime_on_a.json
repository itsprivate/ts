What they don&#39;t show you, is that your government was probably doing these same things right behind your back. I&#39;m not calling out any specific country, but there are governments that have done mass genocide, invasions, destruction of already functioning democratic governments, killing innocent civilians, deforestation, terrible over pollution, drug smuggling/dealing and much much more all just to turn a profit for themselves. Is that not organized crime that has gotten so big that we just have to accept it?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Quick reminder that this is just a friendly CMV discussion, no need to get angry. I&#39;d like to come out of this more appreciative of the people in charge, rather than just always thinking negatively of them.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Thanks for all the insight! I&#39;m out of time, but I&#39;ve awarded the delta.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
