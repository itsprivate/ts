Latinos did not suffer from enslavement at the hands of Americans, they were just denied entry in the U.S. and ran into conflict with them through skirmishes, some colonization leading to citizenship (PR, etc.) and war (Mexico, etc.). So we can infer that the needs of Blacks need to be addressed, especially now that blacks can vote and have human rights granted to them by the government. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not Black nor American but it does bother me to see people make excuses to ignore black people problems like &quot;Okay, but what about all the other races?&quot;. What black people are saying is that their needs are not being met at all, not that they want to impose themselves above other races. But I feel like this message is being ignored and shut down on purpose to deny any responsibility for the damage done to blacks, who have suffered the most at the hands of Americans.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
