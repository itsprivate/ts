Forcing unity of identity between groups of people with little in common other than complexion creates collective white identity which has never historically led to anything positive for race relations. It is far better for instance that white people do not view themselves as a cohesive group but as Irish, Polish, Greek, Italian etc who share little more other than skin color. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, grouping all Black people together is also nonsensical because the cultural differences that exist between an Ethiopian, Nigerian, Dominican, African American and Jamaican are very present as are their experiences. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to end racism and discrimination between groups is to dissolve the sense of group identity along racial lines.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
