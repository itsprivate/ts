Atheists don’t meet once a week to study a text or sing atheist songs. Atheists don’t give 10% of their money each month to an atheist preacher. There are no values to uphold or oppress onto others like religion.</p>\n\n<p>Some people incorrectly claim that atheists “believe there is no God” which is completely incorrect. Atheism is the lack of belief in a God. Atheism requires no faith. At the end of the day, it should never be put in the same category as religion in my opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
