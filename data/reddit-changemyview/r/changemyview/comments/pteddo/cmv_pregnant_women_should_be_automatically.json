I learned shortly beforehand that a woman&#39;s afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There&#39;s no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.</li>\n<li>Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.</li>\n<li>Most women don&#39;t know this is an option so wouldn&#39;t opt into it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.</p>\n\n<p>I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I&#39;m not a doctor of course so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anything I&#39;m missing here. I&#39;m interested in seeing people&#39;s thoughts on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
