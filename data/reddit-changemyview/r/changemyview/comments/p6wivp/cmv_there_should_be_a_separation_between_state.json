For instance, the big tobacco companies lobbying against additional health risk labels on packaging, lobbying doctors to minimize disclosure of health risks, etc. As we&#39;ve also seen recently in the 2016 elections, vast amount of money is also spent by both internal and foreign private agencies (Cambridge Analytica for example) in polarizing the masses and pushing their own divisive propaganda. Most politicians are flat out bought and controlled by private money because they need the cash for their campaigns, and in return, they push whatever policies their benefactors want while pretending to be serving the people.</p>\n\n<p>There needs to be very strict control and regulations against this. If someone wants to run for politics, it should be 100% publicly and transparently funded. While it&#39;s a &quot;free market capitalism system&quot;, there should be prohibitions on what private entities do with their money, like no lobbying, no donating to PACs or political campaigns, etc. Actually enforcing this is another story, and it&#39;s not like this will be the end to all corruption, but I think having a clear separation between these two bodies of power is necessary to ensure a true &quot;democracy&quot;. Currently, private corporate interests are arguably much more powerful than state entities, and I would go so far as to say that the State is just the Corporation in State&#39;s clothing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edits:</p>\n\n<p>- Assume Im talking about the USA</p>\n\n<p>- By private entities or private interests I clarify this to mean privately owned corporations with the financial capacity to influence politics in a way where it is primarily focused on benefiting the main/largest stakeholder of said corporation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
