As a black man, I&#39;ve had people trying to touch my hair my entire life - I don&#39;t like it, in fact I hate it but is it racist in any way shape or form? No. Is it a microaggression? F*ck no. It&#39;s a person who&#39;s seen something different to what they&#39;re used to (my hair) and was thus curious about how it felt (differently from theirs, surely). </p>\n\n<p>If we keep trying to shun people by labeling them with this or that term as soon as they act in a way we perceive as wrong without even giving them the time of day to understand where they&#39;re coming from, we&#39;re going nowhere. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve become so heavily politicized that instead of gaining an understanding through experience, we obtain an illusion of that through the skewed views of the people we follow on social media.</p>\n\n<p>(I&#39;ll just say now that I know I am generalizing when I say &quot;we&quot;, &quot;younger generations&quot;, ... I do understand that not everyone is like this. My point is that social media has seeped through enough of us for this lack of communication to become obvious.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
