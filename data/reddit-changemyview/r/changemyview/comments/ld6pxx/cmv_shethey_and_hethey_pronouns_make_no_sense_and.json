It makes no sense. All the people I met who use she/they pronouns said something like, &quot;but I don&#39;t really fit into the stereotypes of a girl so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fully a girl&quot; and that&#39;s sexist and wrong because it is enforcing gender stereotypes. A lot of them also call themselves trans or part of the LGBT community when they literally haven&#39;t even changed their gender, they just use an extra pronoun. Even straight girls are claiming using she/they makes themselves part of the LGBT community. This is harmful to those who are actually in the LGBT community and it should not be encouraged.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
