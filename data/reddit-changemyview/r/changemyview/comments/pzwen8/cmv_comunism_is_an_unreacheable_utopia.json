The problem is that it is presented as the reachable end point without taking into account how to realistically you would get there or how such a society would deal with greed, selfishness, envy, and any other deffects humans have; most of the time it&#39;s presented the idea that somehow just &quot;following their philosophy&quot; is how you get there  which considering the centuries of history that show how ideas fail or are corrupted when apply to the real world just begs for another failed system if attempted as is.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I can see many failings in our current system that need to be work on and improve, but simply thinking that just replacing it with another one that has considerable less revisions based on it&#39;s application and proven exploits won&#39;t work.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: After responding to several comments I noticed that I didn&#39;t make clear what view I wanted to change, in short is the fact that since so far anyone that has presented a communist society to me has only displayed the ideal version currently can&#39;t see how a pure communist society would work on any level.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
