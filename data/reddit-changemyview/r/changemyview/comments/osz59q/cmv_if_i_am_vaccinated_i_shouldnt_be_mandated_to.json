The only people I know who aren&#39;t vaccinated, at least in my area, simply don&#39;t want it. Why should I be mandated to wear a mask instead of just mandating people get the vaccine? They&#39;re the reason cases are spiking, but I have to start wearing a mask again to protect them? Please, someone explain to me why I should be mandated to do something to protect people who could be mandated to get a vaccine and put an end to Covid-19.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
