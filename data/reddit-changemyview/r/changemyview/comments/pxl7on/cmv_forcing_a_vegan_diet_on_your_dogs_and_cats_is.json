Because they’re obligate carnivores, or &quot;true&quot; carnivores — meaning they depend only on the nutrients found in animal flesh for their survival — their bodies (specifically, their gastrointestinal tracts) are not ideally suited to digesting non-meat foods. Though cats seem to do well on vegan diets once they’ve acclimated to them, the long-term effects of feeding felines diets that lack animal protein have not been established.</p>\n\n<p>And dogs, long considered omnivores, have been reclassified as carnivorous by some leading pet nutritionists. Which means, given our current understanding, that it’s not reasonable to expect best results in health and longevity if you’re feeding them a vegan diet.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that forcing carnivores to consume vegan diets because of our philosophical beliefs is tantamount to animal abuse. I mean, if you really want to feed your pet a vegan diet, consider getting a rabbit. Or a goat. But don’t keep a carnivore and think you can subject him to your own dietary choices.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
