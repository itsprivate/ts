My concern with that (which I did a poor job of conveying previously), is that those structural and hormonal differences can be used to rationalize gender roles and stereotypes which I think many would agree are harmful. That is what I meant in my original tldr. Also, the brain argument makes the question of gender something that can be externally observed, just not on the outside like previously thought.
