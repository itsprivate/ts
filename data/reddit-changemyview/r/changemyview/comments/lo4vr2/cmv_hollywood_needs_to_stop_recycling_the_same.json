Stop relying on nostalgia and make some new ideas for a change. I bet when Star Wars first came out in 1977, it was an amazing and refreshing idea full of cool characters and an amazing world. Same with the firs Terminator movie in the 80's. Back to the Future. The Matrix. These were amazing movies, but ok now they've been done now come up with something new. Stop relying on them and instead come up with the next great movie idea.",
