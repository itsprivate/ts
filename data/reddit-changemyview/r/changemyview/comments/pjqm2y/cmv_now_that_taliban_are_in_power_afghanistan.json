Their agenda is to destroy any military opposition, establish total control with raw power and plunder any available resources. They absolutely have no care for economy or any sort of well-being for population other than what would come from humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n<p>Wide population apparently had no incentive to fight against Taliban. It is pretty visible that so many people just wanted war to be over over any other desire or need. There are very few reports that people took the weapons to protect their own property, even if they were in danger to lose all their belongings, what happened to many. It seems pretty apparent that their only concept is to hope for humanitarian aid that should enable their sheer survival.</p>\n\n<p>We can say that all major &quot;stakeholders&quot; in Afghanistan count on endless inflow of humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n<p>So, now when Taliban took control over the entire country, every single piece of humanitarian aid inflow should be totally stopped. If Taliban rule the country, let Taliban take all, absolute responsibility for survival of population they are rulers of. If people widely think that Taliban will give them stability and sort of minimum prosperity, let them believe that, and let them demand from Taliban to ensure them basics of well being.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, people which really cannot survive and are in danger of imminent starvation and their life is endangered on daily basis - all these people should be allowed to freely leave Afghanistan, to find the country where they&#39;ll be able to make for living.</p>\n\n<p>IF Taliban don&#39;t allow such endangered people to leave the country, it will be visible more than ever that Taliban use wide-population of Afghanistan as their hostages. Than, it will be visible more than ever that humanitarian aid would actually help Taliban to stay in power for long time. Even the most brutal, criminal and destructive regime may survive for indefinite period of time. That must be stopped, once for all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
