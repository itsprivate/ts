I see mostly kids from disadvantaged  socio-economic backgrounds joining the military to escape their dead end  lives. And the military offers that, there is no doubt. I served and  I&#39;m glad I did. The service helped me out of poverty, but I had no  illusions about who and what I was serving. We haven&#39;t been involved in  an existential war since the 1940s. All of our actions after that, and  most of them before, have been to protect and promote the American  corporate hegemony. We want docile trading partners, that&#39;s it. If you  are in the military your only job is to keep the spice flowing. You  don&#39;t protect Americans. You protect American business interests abroad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
