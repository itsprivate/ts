To my mind the Catholic church has basically never done any good and also started the crusades so they&#39;re actually worse than Al-Qaeda, as far as terrorist organizations go. Don&#39;t even get me started on Africa&#39;s AIDS epidemic that they basically started. I see no value in organized religion to begin with, and any as large as the Catholic church is going to cause a lot of trouble as it struggles for power on its way up. To be clear: I think spiritual beliefs are generally a good thing, and following your own moral compass/righteous path is what makes the world go round; it&#39;s the organized religions that inevitably become war machines, or pedophilia rings, or suicide cults, or what have you, that are evil</p>\n\n<p>Edit: !Delta to <a href=\"/u/Iamnotabot\">u/Iamnotabot</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
