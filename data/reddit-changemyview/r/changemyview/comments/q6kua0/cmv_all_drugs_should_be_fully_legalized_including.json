People should be free to live their lives. This way, they will be getting a clean and regulated product, not fentanyl-laced shit a dealer is selling for profit.</p>\n\n<p>The mental gymnastics around drugs is hilarious. I am expected to hate all people who do or sell LSD, cocaine, meth, or heroin. Those people are scum. Let’s give them all life in prison! But liquor companies? Totally fine! Alcohol kills more than any illegal drug does, too. I’m supposed to be totally fine with pharmaceutical companies peddling Adderall, Xanax, and Oxy for people who barely need it. That’s totally fine. But John Doe who sold a few grams to his friends is a criminal? The smoke shop dude who sells pounds of weed out the back of his shop is a dangerous person who needs to be put away?</p>\n\n<p>If nothing else appeals to you, how about freedom? Do people not have the right to decide for themselves whether or not to use drugs? Maybe I’m crazy, but I don’t need the State protecting me from drugs. I’m smart enough to decide for myself.</p>\n\n<p>Please, change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
