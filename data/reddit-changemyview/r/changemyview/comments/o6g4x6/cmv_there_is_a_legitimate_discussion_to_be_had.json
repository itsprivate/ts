That being said I’m not aware of any comprehensive study that’s shows (specifically trans women) do or do not have a competitive edge in women’s sports. I hope I don’t come off as “transphobic” as that’s what I’m being called, but I don’t have an answer and I do believe there are valid points on both sides of this argument.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
