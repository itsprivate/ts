Imagine the situation: Your country gets invaded by one of the most powerful nations at the time. You are winning during the start, but that&#39;s simply because of a minor flaw in your enemy&#39;s camouflage, which will be fixed sooner or later. Then, another nation, the worst enemies of your opponents, offer to help. Then you have either the choice to side with an evil government, at no price at all, (Which then resulted in Italy helping a bit too, and the English being total idiots and siding with the Soviets) to avoid being destroyed, or you could refuse and get crushed. And the thing is; After the continuation war, which they lost as well as the winter war, both of which caused major damages to the USSR and minor to themselves, they signed an agreement with the Soviets to expulse or disarm all Germans remaining in Finland. Which, despite leading to a very short war between them and the nazis, with Finnish victory, meant they only sided with them, in order not to be destroyed. Amd did they adopt any Nazi ideologies? No.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
