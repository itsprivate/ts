Some may even be more  than fallible and venal and not want to admit they were wrong to suspect  you.  \n\n\nKeeping quiet can help you stay away from all this trouble.  \n\n\nSadly, even this advice is no longer perfect, because the Supreme Court has  ruled that an innocent person would have no reason to say something as  straightforward as “I would not like to speak with you because the  constitution affords me the right to avoid self-incrimination.” These days, you have to invoke a different constitutional right and firmly ask for a lawyer!  \n\n\nIn short, the justice system is a system that closes cases, not a system that seeks justice. The antechamber of this Kafkaesque hell is the police station. If you have not managed to avoid the visit to the antechamber, keep quiet until you’ve hired the best legal help you can. In doing so, you’re hiring part of the system, you’re paying cash into the system, you’re getting the system on your side.
