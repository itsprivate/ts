I’m not religious, I’m bisexual and have a boyfriend, we’re both from religious background, converted in atheism. Based on that, is there any legitimate reason as to why two consenting adults shouldn’t be allowed marriage.</p>\n\n<p>The strongest argument I’ve heard if if you legalise gay marriage, then you’ll have people tell religious institutions that you have to host gay marriages, but my counter argument would be how is that any different to saying that you shouldn’t tell churches that they have to host black people’s wedding. As far as I’m concerned I didn’t choose to be bisexual, I was born this way and will always have these feelings, just as people are both black and that’s part of their identity. </p>\n\n<p>Even if you’re pro gay marriage I urge you to take a shot, see if you can come up with any anti gay marriage arguments, it’s called CMV after all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
