Only 3% of Latinos in the US identify with the term according to the Pew Research Center, the vast majority have not even heard of it, and amongst those who have their view of it is overwhelmingly negative. They see it as a white Western attempt to disrespect the rules of the Spanish language for politicized means, which is linguistic imperialism. </p></li>\n<li><p>Given the number of people who actually use the term being so small, it should not be used as the default for all Latinos unlike what corporations and politicians in the US are doing. If you know someone identifies as a woman or a man just call them Latino or Latina. </p></li>\n<li><p>We often say people are the authors of their own experience and this is a central tenet of progressivism especially for the marginalized. So why are people NOT listening to the majority of Latinos who do not want to be called Latinx? It screams “we know what is better for you than you know for yourself so sit back and shut up.”</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
