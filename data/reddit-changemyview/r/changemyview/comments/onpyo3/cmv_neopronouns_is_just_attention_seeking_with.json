If you&#39;re not in the loop these are a bunch of made up words for people who claim they dont fit in the normal pronouns so they make up random words.

Or if people legitimately go around wanting to be called &quot;Xe/Xem/Xyr/Xyrs/Xemself&quot;, &quot;Co/Cos/Co&#39;s/Coself&quot;, &quot;Ae/Aer/Aers/Aerself&quot;, &quot;E/Em/Es/Ems/Emself&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>How does someone decide they&#39;re a Aerself, like I really don&#39;t get it.  I think it&#39;s just something people use when they&#39;re insecure with their identity, and want to get a little attention.  I fail to see how validating these people does anything beneficial for anyone.  Having everyone learn a few hundred new words because people wanna be called made up words doesnt make a lot of sense to me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
