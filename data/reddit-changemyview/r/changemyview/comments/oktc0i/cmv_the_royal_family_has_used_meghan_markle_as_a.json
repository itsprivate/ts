Are the two of those together really a coincidence? </p>\n\n<p>Okay, maybe Meghan is an attention-seeking social climber, but I do believe there is also every chance they have used her to take heat off the other scandals in that family. The news about Epstein and Andrew&#39;s involvement broke out, in desperation, the royal family knew that they needed a scapegoat because they know they rely on public support and couldn&#39;t afford to look bad. Meghan was there, a strong and tough woman who they knew was a threat and wasn&#39;t going to be pushed around so they used the media to do everything they could to make her look bad, and by doing so, the public focused on Meghan and Harry and forgot about Andrew&#39;s association with Epstein. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe some of the talk about Meghan is true, maybe she is an attention-seeking drama queen but also maybe she&#39;s a fierce woman who wasn&#39;t going to kiss the ass of the royals, was going to do her own thing and live her own way and they didn&#39;t like that. With time they saw that they wouldn&#39;t be able to walk over her, which made her dangerous and they put the heat on her when the Epstein scandal broke out. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also inclined to think that Meghan was the only one who knew and was potentially vocal about how personally messed up the family is, she didn&#39;t want to be anywhere near them. The royal family knew this was the real reason she and Harry moved to the states and knowing this made her a threat to their reputation have put the heat on them. The media will say and sensationalize everything, some people are so naive they will believe anything the media says. </p>\n\n<p>This is my personal stance on this matter, and I am open to your views and why you might disagree.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
