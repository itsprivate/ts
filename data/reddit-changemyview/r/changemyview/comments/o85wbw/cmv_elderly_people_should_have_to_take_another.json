His physical health had been deteriorating for a while now and although this could happen to anyone at any age I believe it to be a result of his age and physical decline.</p></li>\n<li><p>My grandma has Alzheimer’s and in the earliest stages of it she ran a stop sign and t-boned another vehicle. I find it unlikely this would have happened had she been retested, because she probably wouldn’t have been declared fit to drive.</p></li>\n<li><p>I was cut off while traveling 45MPH and tboned a car very violently. Both our cars were totaled and although I escaped with minor injuries, the driver (elderly) who cut me off suffered a few broken bones. Both the witnesses who pulled over and the police very quickly determined it was his fault. (Also he tried to sue me after wtf!)</p></li>\n<li><p>I got cut of today by an older gentleman and was about 2 feet away from slamming into his bumper had I not been paying attention, it would’ve been a pretty bad accident. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This incident is what reminded me about how I think we could make the roads safer for all by reevaluating who in our elderly population is still fit to drive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
