Some women will always offer to split only to be polite, with the expectation that the man declines their offer. Some offer or insist on splitting because they have already decided they don&#39;t see it going anywhere and don&#39;t want to take the guys money if they know they are going to end things. And others genuinely are interested in splitting. This is a lot for the man to interpret in the moment. On top of all that, a lot of dating these days happens via dating apps, where there is no guarantee you will see this person ever again or that they will even have the decency to respond to your messages. If everyone could agree that the first few dates are to be split evenly, it would be a much more comfortable situation overall.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
