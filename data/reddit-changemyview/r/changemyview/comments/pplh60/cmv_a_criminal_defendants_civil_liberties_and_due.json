  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Every time there&#39;s a news story involving a crime and a person who isn&#39;t punished to the degree that the public wants him or her to be, there&#39;s bound to be at least one of the following comments, or some variation thereof:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>This paedophile &#39;got off&#39; on a technicality! How is this fair?</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>How can this rapist&#39;s lawyer sleep at night defending such a scumbag?</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>This judge needs to be replaced for vacating this murderer&#39;s death penalty!</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I find these comments seriously misguided. In any sane country, criminal procedure and judicial independence protects not only the rights of criminal defendants, but also everyone else. Civil liberties moderate the power of the state and minimize political influence over the judiciary.</p>\n\n<p>What most laypeople refer to as &quot;technicalities&quot; are in fact fundamental rights. If a rapist is released because he was coerced into incriminating himself, that&#39;s not a technicality. If a terrorist has a death sentence vacated because the jurors were exposed to excessive pretrial publicity, that&#39;s not a technicality. If a case against a child pornographer collapses because much of the evidence was illegally seized and consequently ruled inadmissible, that&#39;s not a technicality. They are violations of civil liberties that were appropriately remedied.</p>\n\n<p>These rights and remedies exist not because the masterminds behind the so-called &quot;system&quot; want to give a middle finger to victims of crime, but because they deter unethical conduct by the state and holds the state accountable for its mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative is frightening, as a young, non-white man. No, I don&#39;t consider it desirable to live under a system where uniformed, jackbooted thugs feel empowered to raid my home and my computer at 4am without a court order, beat a confession out of me, and subsequently imprison me for the next three decades without me having even seen a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Some victims of crime and their friends and families feel distraught should the criminal justice system not bring about the outcome that they desire, and the news media frequently indulges their outrage. It is all too common to read editorialized news stories along the lines of, &quot;<em>This decision by the court forces the victims to testify again and revisit their trauma,</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>So-and-so&#39;s family will have to wait even longer to seek closure</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Victims&#39; rights or interests&quot; are routinely used as a cudgel to attack judges, criminal defense lawyers, and our rights. These attacks are fundamentally unfair. I don&#39;t believe the courts should conduct ad hoc balancing tests to determine whether a victim&#39;s emotional needs override my civil liberties.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
