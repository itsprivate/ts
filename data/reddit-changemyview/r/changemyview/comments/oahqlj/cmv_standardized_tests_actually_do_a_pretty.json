  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have tutored many of the American standardized tests (SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, etc) for years. They&#39;re actually pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>The reading sections of the SAT/ACT perhaps leave the most to be desired. Being able to parse text from 300 years ago is to a large degree a function of having experience reading text from 300 years ago. So, when you get a reading passage like that, it&#39;s testing if you read older books a lot. There&#39;s also the matter of questions that start to venture into a certain bit of subjectivity. &quot;Choose the <em>best</em> answer&quot; they say, and I&#39;ve come upon times where I didn&#39;t entirely agree with what they thought was the &#39;best answer&#39;. This is why I personally would be able to get a perfect score on math sections time and time again, but might get 1 or 2 wrong in the reading.</p>\n\n<p>The grammar sections are better. Gone are the old &#39;this is to that and that is to...&#39; questions, which tested raw vocabulary, and instead it&#39;s mostly testing to see if you understand English. Yes, language evolves, but every needs to learn how to write and speak well in the formal standard of our times, as a practical thing. We want to prepare people to go into job interviews and the like and be able to be well-spoken.</p>\n\n<p>The math sections really didn&#39;t need that many changes, as they are entirely solid. They do exactly what they should: Take material from school, and give it a little bit of a twist that tests a deeper understanding. Excellent. This simultaneously tests a bit of what you learned, and how well you can think. I might give a certain amount of more difficult questions on the SAT, but overall I think it&#39;s a very good evaluation tool. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the proof of that is that you can&#39;t really &#39;crack the code&#39; - I&#39;ve had parents in the past who unfortunately wanted me to arrive with some sort of secret formula to a high score, and the reality is that there isn&#39;t one, because the test is well designed. The secret to a better score is &quot;learn the material, and beyond that have a high IQ&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Other tests are different, but in a proper way. The GRE kind of abandons the idea of testing your high school learning, because it knows you just spent 4 years in college in who knows what major. Better to test you in ways that don&#39;t require a lot of rote math knowledge, but more reasoning skills that are universal - and that&#39;s exactly what it does.</p>\n\n<p>The LSAT, for law school admission, is the closest to a pure IQ test. I kinda gave up on tutoring it, because the reality was there was only so much I could do for people...because it&#39;s an IQ test! I would have gotten above 170 the first time I ever saw the material, because I have a very high IQ, and experience with the questions over time brings me up another 5 points probably. Nothing I can teach you is going to bring you from a 140 to a 180. Nothing. It&#39;s an IQ test. And that&#39;s fitting for law school, where you&#39;re going to want a difficult test for elite-level cognitive and reasoning ability.</p>\n\n<p>So are these tests perfect? No, and they couldn&#39;t be. Are they generally pretty good though? Yes, absolutely. Do they give you a very solid baseline impression of the student you would be getting for your school or program? Totally.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I think people who dislike them tend to do so for the simple reason that they find them hard and don&#39;t score well on them. And to address some other concerns:</p>\n\n<p><em>Aren&#39;t the tests culturally biased?</em></p>\n\n<p>No, they&#39;re not. Even decades ago, where you might occasionally get a question about a &quot;silo&quot; or something that had disparate familiarity to different regions or people, that effect would have been small. Now they&#39;ve gotten very careful about such things. </p>\n\n<p>The only way you can get to cultural bias now is if you go to crazy town where math itself is culturally biased, or the very concept of correct empirical answers is a symptom of white patriarchy. Yeah, there are people who go there, sadly, but they certainly shouldn&#39;t be listened to by anyone serious.</p>\n\n<p><em>But isn&#39;t IQ testing is flawed, and aren&#39;t there are multiple kinds of intelligence?</em></p>\n\n<p>No. At least, certainly not to the degree that gets around, again, spread by people with a certain agenda. The reality is that IQ testing is incredibly robust and predictive, possibly more so than any other psychological metric available. I crush basically all standardized tests, and always have, because the cognitive ability I apply to a test translates super readily through sections of that test, and to all the other tests as well. In high school I got a perfect score on sections of the SAT and ACT without any studying. And equivalently, I tend to score like 140 or so on IQ tests.</p>\n\n<p><em>Doesn&#39;t that kind of invalidate your job?</em></p>\n\n<p>A bit, yes. Like I said, I gave up teaching the LSAT because I felt full of shit. But I can certainly teach someone the rote math and grammar rules they need for the high school tests, and improve their score. Again, no one is going from a 430 to an 800 on an SAT section, but a 600 might be in the cards with some work.</p>\n\n<p><em>So why do people dislike these tests so much?</em></p>\n\n<p>Mostly, because they themselves aren&#39;t very good at them, or their kids don&#39;t do well on them, and that makes them feel bad. So they try to say they don&#39;t measure anything. There&#39;s also a larger cultural movement that tries to dismantle all of these things if it&#39;s shown that results are disparate among different races or sexes, because then that could only be the fault of the test being wrong and evil to them.</p>\n\n<p><em>What could we do better?</em></p>\n\n<p>If I was designing it from the ground up, I would have one test that was pure cognitive/IQ, and other tests that were tests of learned knowledge. You also want the math testing to have a harder curve into more difficult questions, because as it is getting a perfect on the math SAT or ACT is actually quite easy, and so there are students who might be exceptionally capable whose abilities won&#39;t show up. The Korean CSAT is actually an awesome test - the English section is literally better than our English section, and the math section shows a nice road map to me of the level we should be both be teaching advanced students to, and testing them at.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
