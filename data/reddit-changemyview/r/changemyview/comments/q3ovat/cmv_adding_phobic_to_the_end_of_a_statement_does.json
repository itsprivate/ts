The perpetrator automatically calls this person homophobic for simply not obliging to their lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p>This is like calling someone Christian-phobic for not being a Christian. Sounds kind of stupid right? That’s because it leaves no premise for a real discussion and completely shuts down any other point of view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
