However, in this case the officer has additionally acted as judge, jury, and executioner, and the sentence has already been carried out.

If you are truly in a situation in which you fear for your life, the idea of potentially losing your job should pale in comaprison. I believe that this system would cause officers to re-evaluate the necessity of killing in the moment, and would provide incentive for things like body cameras which could prove their innocence of unjustified killing.\n\nedit: there a lot of comments saying that this is how it already works.
