To allow officers to carry guns implicitly grants them approval to kill in situations in which they consider it necessary to do so. These situations are analagous to a death row trial in which the officer is the prosecution and the victim is the defendant. However, in this case the officer has additionally acted as judge, jury, and executioner, and the sentence has already been carried out. The officer should be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt why that person's death was necessary in that moment; it should not be the state's job to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, **if this were to be adopted, I don't think that it necessitates a criminal conviction for the officer** (bolded because too many comments have ignored this).** If the officer is unable to establish sufficient justification for the killing, they should be fired from their job as an officer, forfeit any benefits they may have accrued from their job, and be barred from ever serving in law enforcement again. If you are truly in a situation in which you fear for your life, the idea of potentially losing your job should pale in comaprison. I believe that this system would cause officers to re-evaluate the necessity of killing in the moment, and would provide incentive for things like body cameras which could prove their innocence of unjustified killing.\n\nedit: there a lot of comments saying that this is how it already works. I've looked into it and found similarities to my proposal but what I've seen so far has key differences. **If anyone can provide a link to legislation or civil codes that require police officers who have killed on duty to be subject to an external review, the process of which resembles that of a typical criminal trial, then I will award a delta.
