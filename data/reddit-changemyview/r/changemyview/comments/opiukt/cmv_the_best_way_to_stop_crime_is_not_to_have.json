Making sure people have food, shelter and healthcare would go much further at stopping crime than locking people up or arresting people.   Convictions and prison only exacerbate the problem because when people get out of prison they are treated as second class citizens and struggle to find legitimate ways to meet their basic needs.   Preventing the reason people commit most crimes in the first place is overall cheaper, easier and will lead to improvements for everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
