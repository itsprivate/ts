I don’t have anything against doing so, I just think that invoking the first amendment in such cases is the exact opposite of what its intended use was. In such cases, the government is allowing exceptions to the law based upon religion, when the opposite should be true. Freedom of religion should prevent the government from creating laws that target a specific religion, and allowing exemptions based on religion is the opposite of that.",
