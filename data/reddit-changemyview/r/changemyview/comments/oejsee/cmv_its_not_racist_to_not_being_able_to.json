And yes, I am from the US if that matters.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure if I was exposed to either language on a regular basis, I could probably tell you the difference between them because they seem to be fairly dissimilar despite both being tonal languages, but I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t live in an area with a lot of mandarin or Thai speakers that I know of and I don&#39;t have any of those heritages in my immediate family. So, if I heard it in passing, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d know the difference off the top of my head. Does that make me racist? I don&#39;t think so. I think it&#39;s simply a difference of what I&#39;ve been exposed to in my everyday life, but I&#39;d love to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
