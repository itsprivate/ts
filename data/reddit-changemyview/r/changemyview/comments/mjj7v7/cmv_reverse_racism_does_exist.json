Yes, i believe one can even be racist towards white people. The definition of racism is prejudice towards someone based on their skin. Usually of a marginalized group/minority. But not always. I believe that one can be racist against white people, however racism against white people will NEVER in any realm of possibility be systemic, and also that racism against white people doesnt really need to be talked about or addressed, but i still believe it exists. Even tho its not really important or bad, it still exists. To me, this seems like a logical belief. But i myself am white so im not sure. To alot of people i somewhat consider my friends, this is controversial and i would be considered racist for this opinion. Is my opinion wrong?",
