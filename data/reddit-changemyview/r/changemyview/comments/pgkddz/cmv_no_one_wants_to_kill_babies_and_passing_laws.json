With the recent SB8 law passed in Texas there is a lot of debate and outrage. The most common defense that I&#39;ve seen for it is that it will lead to a decrease in a number of abortions and that those that are against the bill want to see more abortions. However, while there are many factors involved, evidence supports that increasing access to contraceptives and providing more comprehensive sex education contributes much more to decreasing abortion rates than a flat ban.\nI believe that if someone genuinely cared about decreasing the number of abortions they would be against such bills and favor those that systematically support the population.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
