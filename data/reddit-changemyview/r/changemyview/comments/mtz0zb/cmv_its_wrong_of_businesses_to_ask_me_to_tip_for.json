Employee wages should not be subsidized with tips, employees should just but paid fair wages to begin with. \n\nI’ve noticed this trend over the last few years where food shops that only offer counter service have been asking for tips. Places like donut shops, frozen yogurt shops (this one really irks me because you get your food yourself), and coffee shops now ask for tips at the register. I’ve only noticed this at places that have fancy point of sale systems where there’s a touchscreen facing the customer and they sneak in a little tip screen at the end of the transaction. Tipping at the table at restaurants is one thing, but these places ask you to tip while the person you’re supposed to be tipping is watching you make your selection. It’s incredibly awkward.\n\nThe main issue I have with this is that at these places, the employee is providing me with a service for about a minute at the most. They grab my donuts, hand me my bag, then ring me up. Why are you asking for an extra $3 for 60 seconds worth of work? At least at sit down restaurants your server is helping you for a significant amount of time. They’re taking your order, bringing you drinks, providing a line of communication between you and the kitchen, bringing your food out, fixing any errors the kitchen made, all while you’re sitting down and having a good time with your family or friends. They provide you with an experience, and I have no issue with tipping at a restaurant like that. But I get none of that from the guy running the register at the froyo shop.\n\nWhy should I tip these people?",
