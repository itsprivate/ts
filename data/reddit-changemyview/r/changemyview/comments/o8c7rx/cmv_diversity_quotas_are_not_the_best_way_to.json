I think that anyone who is against fairness or equal chances should significantly rethink their life philosophy. Being discriminated based on gender / race / etc is horrible and we should do everything in our power to change that.</p>\n\n<p>Now, from what I notice, the number one initiative to tackles this issue is to impose a diversity quota. You all see this : we commit to have 50% of our board members females, or x% of our workforce latino, etc (depends on the geography as well).</p>\n\n<p>My assumption is that this strategy is to “force” change, by setting these targets. In essence, any organization with such a target needs to do everything in their power to change the way they recruit and promote talent to reach that target.</p>\n\n<p>I also assume this kind of initiatives happen mostly in highly skilled white collar workforce organizations. I don’t see anyone advocating we increase the % of men as hairdressers, % of women as bricklayers, % of blacks in sports, or even ridiculous things like a quotas for prisons.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, I think that these type of policies have the opposite effect than intended. What happens is that companies blindly promote and recruit based on diversity rather than best talent. This leads to more conflict as we are creating environments where employees feel treated unfair since whatever population is underrepresented is privileged.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we not rather focusing on creating equal chances? Blind CVs, better maternity/paternity rules, inclusion trainings, etc. If we treat the process fair, why care if the result is 70%women- 30%men , or whatever you want to measure?</p>\n\n<p>Very curious what you have to say!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Really interesting conversations! Thanks for the people who took their time to answer. While I do think a lot of the comments are going off topic, I definitely learned more about this issue. In reading more about the topic, I came across some interesting materials. Have a look if you are interested:</p>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2018/02/17/ten-years-on-from-norways-quota-for-women-on-corporate-boards\">https://www.economist.com/business/2018/02/17/ten-years-on-from-norways-quota-for-women-on-corporate-boards</a></p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIb3uyTPrk8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIb3uyTPrk8</a></p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-equality_paradox\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-equality_paradox</a></p>\n\n<p>I am still not convinced that gender quotas is the right way to go forward, and do believe that there are unintended consequences. However, I am optimistic for the future and hope all of us who feel under represented will see better days. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
