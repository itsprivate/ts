I think that the Olympics is one of the better ideas humanity has come up with, as we get to see representatives at the top of their game push beyond their limits and dedicate their time to their craft. To me, the Olympics has always been marketed as a show of perseverance and athletes overcoming both the odds and previous limitations, and that’s really inspiring to me. In that context, while I can say that stepping down isn’t a bad thing (especially in Biles’ case), I don’t really see how it’s praiseworthy.</p>\n\n<p>I’m a first time poster, and I’m open to have my view changed, so fire away in the comments</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
