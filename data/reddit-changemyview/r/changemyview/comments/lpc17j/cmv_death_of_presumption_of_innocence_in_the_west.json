  "selftext": "\"Presumption of innocence\" is a fundamental concept that constitutes Westerner law systems: you're not guilty (thus accountable) until proven so. \n\nIn current times, this concept has socially died. I'm going to use a controversial argument to explain it: accusations of harassment or rape on Twitter, or social medias in general. I can't seem to accept the fact that people lose their job, get constantly harassed, can't defend thenselves because someone on social media accused them of something that hasn't yet been proven, only because society tends to take victim's side most of the times.\n\nOf course, there are cases clearer than others; of course, not every trial starts with the defendant who denies the charges, but still: not waiting for a court to actually expose crimes which have or not been committed is horrible. Just think about it for a second: how would you feel if some random person on the internet, out of spite or whatever reason, accused you of rape and you'd lose your job, your friends, your entire life because of it only because society wasn't willing to wait for you to defend yourself on court?\n\nMovements like #MeToo were extremely good and I supported (and still support) them with all my might, even by actually taking part in protests, petitions and such; what was followed, though (like the \"Believe all Women\" hashtag), has been horrible, anti-democratic, extremely dangerous. Obviously I'm not fixated on this particular theme, and I have other examples I could talk about, it's just the easier and most efficient I believe I can use right now.\n\nSo what do you think? How can I change my mind and understand that, perhaps, presumption of innocence is a mistake just like lots of people do nowadays? Is there any reason in particular we should forsake it? Is our society only evolving and not devolving, losing sight of our social achivements? Thank you for reading.",
