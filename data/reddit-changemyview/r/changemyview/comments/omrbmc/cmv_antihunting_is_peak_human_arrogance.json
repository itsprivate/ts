Many of the people who hate hunting argue that it’s cruel to kill animals despite having no problems with predators killing other animals, as if we’re “above” them and no longer just as much a part of the environment because of our intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also the fact that many ecosystems rely on humans to regulate herbivore populations. African animals, for example, have specifically evolved to compete with humans and it’s speculated that this is one of the (many) reasons African megafauna did not experience as drastic of a decrease as megafauna outside of Africa did. One might argue this is another example about the dangers of hunting, but this was a long time ago and with proper regulation these things can and have been avoided since. </p>\n\n<p>I see no proper argument as to why hunting should be outlawed other than a whole lot of subjective feelings</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
