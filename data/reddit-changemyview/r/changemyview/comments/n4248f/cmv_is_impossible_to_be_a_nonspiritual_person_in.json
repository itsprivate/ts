For spiritual people, that is a god. For atheists, they say to make it about society in general. The way the steps are written- the spiritual growth has to occur in a way that conforms to others’ thinking. You have to have a sponsor, and the steps are pretty much all social/pro-conformity in nature. It pretty much says you need to have a group and “cant do this yourself”.  You cant really be too non-conformist if you want to work AA. \n\nThey shun people who hold “resentments” or negativity (even if valid). They must not “be working a good program”. Ok - Im out, I thought this was supposed to be about getting sober but feels like Church.",
