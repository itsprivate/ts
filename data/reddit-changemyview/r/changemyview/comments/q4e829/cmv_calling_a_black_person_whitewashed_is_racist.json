  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>(If this has already been discussed please link it😁)</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;ve been on tiktok a lot and there will be a video with a black person talking &quot;proper&quot;, basically not AAVE, and there will be hundreds of comments calling them whitewashed and asking if they&#39;ve been &quot;picked&quot; by the whites yet. They also make it seem like the reason they don&#39;t speak AAVE is because they&#39;re embarrassed by it, while the most likely case is that they just weren&#39;t raised speaking it. These also aren&#39;t small comments, I&#39;ve seen a few with 10 thousand plus likes.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I&#39;ve seen is if a black person is with a group of white people the comments will be like why is he hanging out with white people, does he not have black friends, thats real suspicious. As if a black person can&#39;t have white friends because if they do then they&#39;re whitewashed.</p>\n\n<p>Probably the worst example I saw was this black girl that was adopted by a white family. She got horribly bullied by people on tiktok untill she deleted her vids. They were saying that she couldn&#39;t ACTUALLY be black, that she was being indoctrinated with racist white ideals, and that her family only adopted her for diversity points.</p>\n\n<p>This all seems incredibly racist to me, but whenever I try to point it out I just get slammed with insults and people saying that a white boy obviously wouldn&#39;t get it, and maybe I don&#39;t, that is why I&#39;m here after all. Basically I&#39;m looking for somone to explain to me how saying that because a black person talks a certain way, has a certain political view, was raised a certain way etc... isn&#39;t racist, and if it&#39;s not then what is it. Or also if you&#39;ve seen it used to refer to a black person in a non racist way.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so as was pointed out to me this is colorism, not racism. I still think that this is overall detrimental to the black community despite it not being racism its still discriminatory.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
