I simply don&#39;t get why one should be &#39;accepted&#39; while the other is deterred. (note: This is not an argument for me to go back to drinking)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you all for the replies - even the ones calling me an idiot. Two quick add-ons: The specific article in question that made me write this was all about how a hotel did a poor job of catering to &#39;plus-size&#39; people due to the fact that towels and toilets were &quot;too small.&quot; I am not advocating for cruelty or &#39;shaming,&#39; but rather, this notion that the world should change instead of oneself. </p>\n\n<p>Second, your comments have made me realize that I have carried a big chip on my shoulder in regards to my own lack of support - perhaps, seeing &#39;acceptance&#39;, whether it&#39;s for addiction, being overweight, etc., touches a nerve because it was so absent in my earlier life.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
