Nuclear energy has unfortunately suffered some pretty large PR disasters in the past (Chernobyl, Fukushima etc) and this has understandably shaken public trust in its safety. Despite its bad rep, nuclear energy has consistently been shown to be orders of magnitude safer than most other methods of electricity generation.</p>\n\n<p>Chernobyl had too much red tape. Fukushima was built on a fault line. The third was almost a disaster. Need I say more?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh\">Studies </a> have shown that nuclear energy causes just 0.07 deaths for every tera-watt hour of electricity generated. This is in comparison with 2.82 for gas, 18.43 for oil and 32.72 for coal. Nuclear power plants do not release any carbon dioxide during the course of energy generation and even accounting for CO2 emissions during construction, the emissions associated with nuclear energy are still 50 times lower than those associated with coal power and 30 times lower than those associated with coal mining and natural gas.</p>\n\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of the pollution released by coal power is that ash released from burning coal often contains highly concentrated levels of thorium and urainium. <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/\">Studies </a> have shown that exposure to the elevated levels of radioactive material present in coal ash has the result that people living in the vicinity of coal power stations experience radiation doses up to 200% greater than those living close by to nuclear power plants. Bizarrely enough, the radioactive waste produced by burning coal is actually more radioactive than the waste from nuclear power and yet there are no restrictions on coal ash simply being released into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is a low carbon, low risk method of energy generation and has an essential part to play in the battle against climate change.</p>\n\n<p>Hydro and Wind can&#39;t run entire countries without a really large supply of either. At best, they simply lower costs overall.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
