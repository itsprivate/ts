If you look at trends on how people are doing globally things are getting better but in western countries like Canada, US, Australia ect. it&#39;s all getting worse, I believe suicides especially of young people is the greatest indicator of that. Unless we stop catering to boomers or more likely until they simply all die off of old age our societies will continue to deteriorate.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: someone already convinced me to let boomers off the hook for global warming relative to older generations so I won&#39;t be replying to those arguments anymore.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
