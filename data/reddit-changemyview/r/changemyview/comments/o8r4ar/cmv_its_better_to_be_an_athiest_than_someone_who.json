They don&#39;t attend religious services often when it is expected of them, break many commandments that their religion has and so on. </p>\n\n<p>I realize that the teachings of many religions talk about being accepting of those who are trying to improve themselves and to not be too judgmental of those who choose to &quot;sin&quot;, but there has to be a point where the  religious devotions they do offer every once in a while could be seen as mocking in a way towards the higher power they profess to believe in and worship, but they spend MUCH more time thinking of the next one night stand, cookout, night out with their friends binge drinking, etc.</p>\n\n<p>You would think that they would be more comfortable embracing a belief system that excludes a higher power and religious devotion so they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re stuck in a devotion system that they aren&#39;t truly involved with. You&#39;re outwardly expressing the beliefs you have on the inside of yourself. Sure, you may disappoint friends and family you have who are religious, but it beats the inner turmoil of being in a part of a belief system you begrudgingly accept for one reason or another.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
