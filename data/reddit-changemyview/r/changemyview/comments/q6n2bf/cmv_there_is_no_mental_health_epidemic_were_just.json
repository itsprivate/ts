We are finally becoming aware of mental health issues and accepting it for what it is. In previous generations, people didn&#39;t go to therapy, it was perceived as weak, now it is something that is commonly accepted and encouraged. Take for example the post-war generation. I&#39;m sure that many soldiers that came back were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48528841\">mentally affected</a> and damaged by what they saw and did; the modern solution would be to go to therapy and talk it out. In those days, you just drank to try to numb the pain. Before women&#39;s liberation, housewives were <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/gqmx9j/here-lady-take-some-pills-for-your-hysteria-253\">commonly drugged</a> instead of them dealing with their emotions. </p>\n\n<p>If you can pardon the comparison, it is similar to the arguments some homophobes make against the LGBT community. They say &quot;look, there are many more gay people now than then ever was, this is because of the more liberal culture we live in now, not because they are naturally LGBT.&quot; Just because we are now more cognizant of something, doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t prominent in the past. </p>\n\n<p>To add a personal example: looking back, my mother&#39;s father&#39;s side of the family would all probably have been diagnosed with something, from depression to schizophrenia. In their time, they weren&#39;t, so their descendants being diagnosed with illnesses doesn&#39;t mean there is a rise in mental health issues. </p>\n\n<p>So in short, my argument is that there isn&#39;t something new going on about a mental health epidemic; we are just more aware and focused on the mental health of people where in previous generations people have to just &quot;deal with it&quot;. (An example of this would be the commonly held belief that shell shock (PTSD) was due to &quot;low moral fiber.&quot;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
