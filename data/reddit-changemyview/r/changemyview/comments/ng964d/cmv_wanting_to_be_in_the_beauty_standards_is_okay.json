Being fully real, I'm not doing it \"for myself\". I'm doing it only to fit in the beauty standard and it's okay to be honest about that. Nobody is born finding themselves ugly, I used to think of myself as very pretty when I was a little girl. Society's beauty standards made me hate myself and there's nothing wrong with wanting to change something in your body for that reason. I'm sure I'll have a way better self-esteem after I change that little detail that bothers me so much and I really don't care if I'm perpetuating an unhealthy beauty standard or whatever. I'm not saying you should obsess over every little imperfection (I have many insecurities that I can live with just fine), but when it comes to something that kills your self-esteem completely, I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to change it just because it's a society imposed standard.",
