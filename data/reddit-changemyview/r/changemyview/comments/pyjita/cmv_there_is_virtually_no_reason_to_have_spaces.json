Most male/female divisions (bathrooms, prisons, dressing rooms, etc.) are separated due to physical differences in bodies, not mental states.   </p>\n\n<p>For example: Dressing rooms are traditionally separated by sex, as males and females have different body parts that are revealed while getting dressed.  Someone&#39;s gender identity is not visible at all in a dressing room, and isn&#39;t relevant to separate people by.  I do know if the person next to me has a penis, I don&#39;t know if they identify as a man/woman/neither/both/other.    </p>\n\n<p>Another is sports.  Sports are separated by sex due to the huge physical differences males and females have.  Gender identity has no relevance when assigning sports teams (for example there is no issue with the non-binary, female soccer player in the olympics, she was placed on the team due to sex, not gender identity.). It is irrelevant in the race what gender people identify with.</p>\n\n<p>So if there is a division needed, it will virtually always be regarding sex.  There is really no basis to have any divisions based on gender identity (excluding groups that need support for gender identity issues, for example, this post is discussion separating the population in two.)</p>\n\n<p>Separating spaces such as sports, bathrooms, dressing rooms, prisons, shelters, etc. by gender identity has no purpose, as gender identity is invisible, can be changeable, and isn&#39;t relevant to the physical basis why these were originally separated.  </p>\n\n<p>Again, this isn&#39;t to discount gender identity, it is just saying it isn&#39;t a basis for physical separation.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t believe there should be separations by sex, then there is definitely no reason to separate due to gender.</p>\n\n<p>So to clarify, this isn&#39;t arguing that spaces need to be sex segregated (that is a different debate), but that sex does have a legitimate basis for separation, <strong>there is no reason that gender identity would be the basis for separating these spaces.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
