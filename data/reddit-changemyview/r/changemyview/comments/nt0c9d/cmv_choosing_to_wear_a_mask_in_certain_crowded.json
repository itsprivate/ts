Am I living in fear because I get vaccines and make sure my daughter is vaccinated? Am I living in fear because I brush my teeth everyday and floss a few times a week? Am I living in fear because have a smoke detector and a fire extinguisher in my house? Am I living in fear because I have a ring camera doorbell?

Am I living in fear because I wear shoes when walking around town? Am I living in fear because I where a helmet when I ride my bike?\n\nIdk. I really don't. I'm just trying to live life. I'm not holed up in my home surrounded by hand sanitizer and jars of piss. I just want to put a piece of cloth over my mouth AND NOSE. It's actually really nice in the winter for staying warm and in the summer it's not as bad as people try to make it out to be.\n\nI'll tell you one way I definitely don't live in fear. I don't keep a gun in my house or walk around strapped 24/7. Is wearing a mask more \"living in fear\" than people who are armed to the nines just in case they get attacked? (Something millions of Americans do.)\n\nAnd guess what, all the things I mentioned that I do to keep myself and my loved ones safe have strong empirical evidence to support that they make you a safer person and increase the chance that I can live a long healthy life. Gun ownership, however, greatly increases the probability that you or a loved one gets shot.\n\nI'm just try to have a common sense routine that keeps me safe. It really doesn't interfere with my life. I go to work, I go to the store, I hang out with friends and I have like 4 or 5 concert tickets already bought for this summer and fall. I just do some of those things with one more article of clothing than I use to\n\nIt makes me think about an old joke line about George W Bush. 'George Bush believes on Wednesday the same thing he believed in Monday no matter what happened on Tuesday.'\n\nSomething happened last year. And it was awful. If that doesnt make you want to change something I don't know what to tell you.\n\nFlu deaths were down by an order of magnitude. Masks save lives, full stop.\n\nImagine if we already had, say, 70% of the population wearing masks casually out in crowded public space before covid started to spread. Imagine if most people already had a personal store of masks in their house before this started so that they were prepared to mask up immediately. It might not have gotten off the ground at all.\n\nPlus its fashion. It's another way to Express yourself. They can be colorful and fun.\n\nWHEN the next pandemic comes and we handle it better than covid it's going to be because of people like me. Wearing a mask is more effective at stopping me from spreading my germs to others than it is at keeping germs off me anyway. So it's more of a common courtesy to others than it is me being afraid.\n\nWear a mask save a life. That's it. That's not living in fear. It's just applying common sense health practices to your routine",
