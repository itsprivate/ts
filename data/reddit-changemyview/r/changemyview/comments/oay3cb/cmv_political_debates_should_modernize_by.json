These should be backed up by easily accessible sources, so that the viewers can verify the claims if they want to, while they are watching the debate.</p>\n\n<p>When it goes into the shorter rapid-fire debates between two candidates this obviously isn&#39;t feasible. Instead, I feel like the respective campaigns should be forced to put out a statement afterward citing sources for as many of the points their candidate made as is possible. If they said something that can&#39;t be backed up, then they issue an apology and a clarification. This would preferably be done at the next debate or some other televised event.</p>\n\n<p>I know that this is far from perfect and that it&#39;s possible to find sources supporting most opinions. However, politicians have been known to just spout random &quot;facts&quot; that are later proven false. I think this would go a small way to deter this type of behavior, without decreasing the viewability or essence of a political debate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
