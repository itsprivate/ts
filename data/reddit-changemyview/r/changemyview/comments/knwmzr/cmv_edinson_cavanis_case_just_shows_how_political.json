Since some people were offended by it, Cavani deleted the tweet and apologize. But now, the FA gave Cavani a <em>three-game ban</em> and a <em>£100k fine.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now, we should all fight against racism and we all now it&#39;s terrible. But c&#39;mon, he can&#39;t even speak his own language now? I get some people thought it wasn&#39;t right to say that word, but if you don&#39;t keep in mind the context then we may as well walk on eggshells whenever we are saying anything. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I think there&#39;s another moral debate here. The FA is punishing Cavani for saying something in spanish, his own language. They are, in a way, canceling his own language which it&#39;s bizarre. </p>\n\n<p>Cavani must also complete a course for breaching the FA rules which I think it&#39;s the right thing to do. But that should&#39;ve been the end of the story. Because a three-game ban, that includes the derby, and a 100k fine (some would say that it&#39;s nothing compared to his wages but it&#39;s still a tone of money) for saying &quot;mate&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, this whole thing was this big of a deal because of social pressure. I follow quite a few well known people from Uruguay (mainly sports related people) and I can ensure you there are cases like this every time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
