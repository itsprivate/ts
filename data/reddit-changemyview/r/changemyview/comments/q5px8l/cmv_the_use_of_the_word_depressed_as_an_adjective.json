Of course, I know this won’t guarantee much of anything, but I still feel that, at least from the bottom of my heart, I still want to see some discourse on this matter.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, there has been a crackdown on the use of terms such as “gay” and “retarded” to describe items and people in a condescending way. Yet, there has been, at least from what I’ve seen, considerable backlash against the uses of these terms for vulgar purposes because they demean people who are homosexual and clinically proven to have mental retardation.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I see the word “depressed” being flung about quite haphazardly as an appeal to edge. For example, some people might act all gloomy and somewhat melodramatic and say something along the lines of them being “depressed,” even if they actually aren’t diagnosed. Sometimes the term is simply flung about as an attention grabber.</p>\n\n<p>It feels as if this poor use of the word “depressed” is actually similar to other poor uses of words like “retarded” and “gay,” because like the aforementioned two, “depressed” also describes an actual condition that people can have and come down with. In what way is using “depressed” as an adjective is any different from using “retarded” and “gay?” </p>\n\n<p>I am willing to keep an open mind to this issue, because there might always be something I am overlooking that might need to be addressed and discussed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
