  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I believe there are mainly two types of cancel culture that we see today. The first type is just cancelling someone from the platform where they committed egregious behavior on. If you act like a piece of shit at a bar, the bar can cancel you from stepping foot in their business in the future. If you are harassing people and being racist on Twitter, Twitter can ban you.</p>\n\n<p>The second type of cancel culture is advocating for the person&#39;s cancellation outside of just the platform where they committed egregious behavior. I&#39;ve seen people go as far as getting people fired from their jobs, getting people kicked out of college, getting people evicted, etc. This is the type of cancel culture that I am focusing on in my CMV.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I would consider myself on the left politically. However, I am against the left&#39;s embrace of this second type of cancel culture because I find it very hypocritical. How can you on the one hand laugh at someone for losing their job for saying something racist or insensitive online, then on the other hand advocate for a more rehabilitative justice system where even murderers should have a path towards redemption and a normal life?</p>\n\n<p>I see this all the time where the same people that ridicule a white person for getting fired from their job or kicked out of college will go around saying that a black guy involved in gang violence should be offered rehabilitation. Either both should be extended a path to redeem themselves, or both should be subject to retributive justice. Having one position for one type of person and another position for another shows that you are ideologically motivated, have no principles, and are hypocritical. CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
