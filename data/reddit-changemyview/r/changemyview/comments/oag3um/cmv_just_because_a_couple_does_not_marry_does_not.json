It also does not mean that they will not be together long-term or even forever......because they still could. I mean, I know a couple who has lived together for 25 years. They live together, are monogamous, travel together, bond with other’s families, and don’t seem to have any signs of breaking up anytime soon. They just don’t feel like they need a piece of paper to prove their love. You mean to tell me that they have less commitment than what society considers, “married”?</p>\n\n<p>And also, traditional marriage also feels like a scam. I mean, If it doesn’t workout, it only leave you more debt if you can’t afford a prenup. These other legal benefits is unfair  because why is it that only married couples can visit each other in the hospital and get have marital tax deductions and all that? Their love is no more special than the couple I mentioned in the first paragraph.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
