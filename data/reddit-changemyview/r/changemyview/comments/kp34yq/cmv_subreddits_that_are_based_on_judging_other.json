Subscribing to these subreddits is filling your feed with harmful negativity that just isn't necessary, and likely leaves your mood worse off (even if just very slightly) with each post. \n\nThink for a moment why you're subscribed to these and ask yourself if it's really giving you any personal gain and benefit. If you think it does, change my mind. \n\nAlso, I get that there sometimes can be a blurry line between laughing at idiots because what they did was genuinely funny, and laughing at them because their idiocy angers you. Like r/IdiotsInCars for example. I think the latter is what harms you. That is, if your interest is based on hate, anger, resentment or judgement.\n\nA few examples that I've come across: r/facepalm , r/entitledparents , r/TumblrInAction , r/LeopardsAteMyFace, r/SelfAwarewolves , r/MaliciousCompliance, r/pettyrevenge, r/im14andthisisdeep , some of r/Cringetopia \n\nI can't think of any more examples right now, but I hope you understand to what kinds of subreddits I'm talking about.",
