I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone, I don&#39;t want to make people feel uncomfortable with themselves but at the same time I know internally that I will never see a trans woman as anything but a man with mental health issues. For me (and I imagine most people) &quot;woman&quot; has traditionally meant both &quot;female&quot; and &quot;presents as a woman&quot; but now I&#39;m being told that being a &quot;woman&quot; is just about how you present. I&#39;m not saying this is wrong, but it&#39;s not how I use &quot;woman.&quot; I feel like if I accept trans women as &quot;women&quot; I&#39;m not really accepting them as women but just changing my internal definition of what a woman is, and then what&#39;s the point?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
