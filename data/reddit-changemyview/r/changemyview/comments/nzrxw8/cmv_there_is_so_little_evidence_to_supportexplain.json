If we were to cut out the cerebrum, we would either destroy the patient's ability to think, or we would destroy their consciousness.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to remove the parts of the brain that interprets our senses, then we would lose those senses (sight, smell, etc). So we all agree that without the brain those senses evaporate, why would our consciousness, our being, or our person-hood be any different? Because if you have no sensation, no thinking, no mental/physical activity, what is the difference between that and someone who is 'gone?'\n\nWe agree that those who have not yet been born do not exist because they have none of the above criteria (thoughts, sensations). What possible reason is there to think those who have died are in any different kind of state?\n\nSo to sum up: Due to our understandings of the brain, the belief in the afterlife can be dismissed as a childish fancy borne our of fear and grief. It is just as baseless, perhaps even more so, than believing any of the following: That skin colors make certain people superior/inferior, that vaccines cause autism, that the earth is flat, that your astrological sign determines your personality, that Lord of the Rings is historical fact, or that Elvis is alive.\n\nGranted due to the existential nightmare we find ourselves in the belief in an afterlife, while being even more unfounded and irrational than any of the above, is much, much more forgivable and understandable, due to the above mentioned fear and anxiety.\n\nIf I'm wrong let me know. I'd love to have reasons to stop believing that we're all destined for the void.\n\nEdit: A few people have made the argument 'But belief in the afterlife helps people act better/be happy, or in other ways make their lives better.'\n\nTrue, but good effects say nothing about the truth values of their claims.
