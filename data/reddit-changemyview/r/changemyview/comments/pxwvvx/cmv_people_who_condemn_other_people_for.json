This concept of trying to erase other opinions, regardless how moral or immoral one regards them to be inherently contradicts the basis of democracy and therefore people who do this and yet claim to be democratic are hypocrits. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, everyone is allowed to disagree with opinions and even publicly arguing against them, but &#39;cancelling&#39; people over viewpoints or things they said has no part in a democratic system.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t necessarily think that this is wrong but everytime I voice this I get downvoted so there seems to be a flaw in my logic. I&#39;m always open to change if someone can convince me :)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am solely talking about viewpoints that are within the democratic system.
