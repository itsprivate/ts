Narcissistic, stubborn, narrow minded and self righteous, and all the other terms you can think about to describe horrible parents. Toxic parents. </p>\n\n<p>Why should any kid stay to take care of their parents if they were toxic to them? In fact, <em>some</em> parents have children because they’re afraid of dying alone and expects their children to take care of them. (a good number of old asian parents do that btw, source: am Asian) </p>\n\n<p>By these type of parents I mean, parents who can’t accept their children’s sexuality or religion. Like when religious parents find out their kid is gay or is atheist and they completely lose their shit. Like as if being gay is wrong or a crime, or if not believing in god is a sin. Clearly some parents live in the Stone Age when it’s fucking 2021 </p>\n\n<p>Parents constantly trying to control them / controlling them when they were young, constantly arguing with them and manipulate them. Gaslighting them and guilt tripping them.  Or having insane expectations that their kids need to get all A’s or they are a disgarce to the family, or that their kids need to do a high end job / prestigious job like a doctor, etc (asian parent mindset) </p>\n\n<p>We don’t owe shit to our parents, they decided to bring us to the world. If they were good parents, then in return, they deserve to be taken care of. If you had a shitty childhood / majority of your life was shit when you lived with them, then they deserve to die alone and deserve to be abandoned.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
