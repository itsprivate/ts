These discussions are usually the shortest ones and I find that I have to start treading more and more carefully up to the point that the other person doesn&#39;t want to discuss things any further. </p>\n\n<p>My assessment of this is that the person&#39;s refusal to engage is because they don&#39;t know how to respond to some of the counter-points/arguments and so they choose to ignore it, or attack the person rather than the argument. Also, since they have a tendancy to get angry/agitated, they never end up hearing the opposing arguments and, therefore, never really have a chance to properly understand where there might be flaws in their own ideas (i.e., they are in a bubble). </p>\n\n<p>The result is that they just end up dogmatically holding an idea in their mind. Whatsmore, they will justify becoming angry or ignoring others by saying that those &quot;other ideas&quot; are so obvisouly wrong that the person must be stupid/racist/ignorant etc. and thus not worth engaging with. This seems to be a self-serving tactic which strengthens the idea bubble even more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
