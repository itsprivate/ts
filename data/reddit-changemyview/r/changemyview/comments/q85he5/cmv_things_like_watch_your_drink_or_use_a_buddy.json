But these aren&#39;t victim blaming. If you don&#39;t lock your door to your house and it gets broken into, it&#39;s not your fault. But telling someone to lock their door isn&#39;t blaming them. It&#39;s just a tip to reduce the chance they get their house broken into. You can&#39;t prevent rape or robberies but you can reduce the risk of them. So telling someone to watch their drink or have a friend watch your drink isn&#39;t victim blaming. It&#39;s just giving people ways to avoid the unsavory situation.  If a rapist wants to rape someone, he or she will but you can take actions to increase safety.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
