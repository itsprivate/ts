  "selftext": "For as long as I've been on Reddit I have noticed certain subs like News and PublicFreakouts have a massive issue with the propaganda machine coming out of the middle east to make Israel look bad. Often the posts are made from accounts which do nothing but post anti-Israel stuff or they post stories without including certain aspects. \n\nFor example they will mention when Israel attacked and killed people. But they will leave out the part where Israel was attacked first and thus responded. And if you point this out, you get downvoted into oblivion by the propaganda machine at work in those subs. \n\nTo make it worse these people will post old stories/videos/pictures and make them sound new to drum up more hate for Israel. And the people upvote this stuff. They really are good at propoganda. If you look at terrorism in the middle east, they do not shy away from using technology to their advantage. The fact they make 4k videos of themselves beheading people shows you that. \n\nAnyone who researches the topic will easily find out how often the other side attacks Israel first. You can even find videos of terrorists using children as shields when they fire mortars. Or having children stab adults and then they praise the kids. Snipers shooting Israely citizens across the border...etc. Or the videos of kids constantly throwing stones at IDF forces.  \n\nNow to top it off I should mention I have family in Israel. They are not Israeli nor Jewish. They are OFWs (Oversea Filipino Workers) and almost every day they talk about the barrages of fire coming into Israel and how they always have to hide in shelters or lower places as the alarms bare. \n\nNow let's be clear... I am NOT saying Israel is some perfect angel of a country. They sometimes do terrible things too. But many times it's in response to something else. Both sides need to work this stuff out. I'd also point out people's last-ditch response is \"Israel stole land!\" Well technically no. Both people existed at the same time throughout history. It's Palestine who took over the land and claimed it as a country. If America didn't give land to the Native Americans, you would be mad right? Though to be fair the natives got a crappy deal anyways. \n\nThey could share but they refuse to because of the simple fact Israel (well many of its citizens) are not Muslim and thus they are seen as enemies. I'd point out is if Israel was the bad guy, why did they invent the Iron Dome? You only make such a device if you are constantly being attacked. Israel is surrounded by nothing but enemies that have stated they want it destroyed. Can you blame them for trying to fight back? \n\nIn the end when it comes to Reddit the fact the propaganda machine gets away with so much really bugs me. I've even seen stories that are pro-Israel on certain \"neutral\" subs get downvoted and/or removed. Which is indeed one of the problems with Reddit. If reddit cares about \"fake news\" then they should really have mods that are willing to delete stories that are fake or misleading.",
