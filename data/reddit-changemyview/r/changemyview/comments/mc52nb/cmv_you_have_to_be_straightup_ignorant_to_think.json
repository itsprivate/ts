This only works if we assume that everyone who commits a crime with a gun is a complete anarchist, with no respect for any law, anywhere. It also assumes that they are all very resourceful and know how to find themselves a black market to purchase a gun, or even how to break in and steal a gun without detection. These are some pretty huge assumptions, yet they are made about literally everyone who commits any kind of shooting.\n\nWhy are we not considering the possibility of people snapping? That perhaps humans are not life-long criminals and that a had set of circumstances leads them to think, for perhaps just a short time, \"you know what, I'm pissed, I'm going to shoot some people\". Do we really believe that when this pissed-off person encounters barriers that prevent him from buying a gun right away, that he absolutely 100% will keep going, 100% of the time, that there's a zero percent chance that after failing to obtain a lethal weapon by legal means that he absolutely will, 100% of the time, successfully find a black market or successfully break into a home and steal a weapon, and then not get caught, and then carry out his rampage? Are you starting to see why I think this viewpoint is straight-up ignorant? Because that's all pretty extreme. \n\nWe even see this effect at play with suicide deaths, and that is almost certainly our biggest opportunity to save lives. Many who survive a suicide attempt get help, get treated, and then lose the desire to kill themselves. The often-cited hypothesis that suicidal people WILL kill themselves no matter what is *just not true*, and it pains me to see anyone ever try to peddle that theory, as if mental health problems cannot be treated. They absolutely can be and it is beyond shitty to try and argue that suicidal people are hopeless cases, just to defend a gun stance. That's actually really disgusting.\n\nCMV.\n\nEdit: some are struggling to understand my view or are embellishing it, so let me be clear: I am simply disagreeing with this viewpoint that 100% of those who committed gun violence would have done it no matter what, that our gun laws will have literally no effect whatsoever. I am not calling for a ban on all guns, confiscation of all guns. I am simply disagreeing with a very common argument that is used often in the gun control debate.",
