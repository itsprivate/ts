  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pies, jams, smoothies, muffins and more, I can&#39;t think of a single berry with more uses than the humble blueberry. Strawberries do have the advantage of making a sick ice cream but when&#39;s the last time you saw a strawberry muffin? I thought not. I suppose cranberry juice is pretty nice but I think blueberry smoothies offset that too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ease of use</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some berries like strawberries require removing a green thing before they&#39;re eaten and pretty much need to be cut up. Blueberries just need a quick rinse before they can be chomped down upon. Wanna eat just one blueberry? Have a quick, tiny snack! Wanna ingest a giant spoonful of blue and round goodness? Enjoy that as well! Blueberries work great with both a fork and a spoon too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best bush</strong></p>\n\n<p>Raspberry bushes are covered in spikes and are very scary in general. 0/5, not family friendly at all, my kids were very scared. Blueberry bushes, on the other hand, are inviting, gentle creatures. They are a bit more of a pain to take care of (I accidentally mowed a part of a baby one, oops), but I think the benefits make it well worth it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not gonna sit here and pretend that blueberries are the cheapest berry, they aren&#39;t. But is that really what we should be looking at when it comes to price? A GT 1030 is cheap, but does that make it the best graphics card? Of course not. What really matters is price to performance, and on that front I don&#39;t think you can fault the blueberry even slightly. Sure, it might cost a bit more per calorie but given all the aforementioned uses for the blueberry I think it&#39;s well worth the price of admission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I think has been thoroughly demonstrated, the blueberry is the berry to reign superior over all other berries. I look forward to seeing what others have to say on the matter...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
