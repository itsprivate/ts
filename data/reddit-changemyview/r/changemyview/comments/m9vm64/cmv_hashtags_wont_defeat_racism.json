But nobody who's racist is going to see #stopasianhate or #blm or whatever and think, damn it, you know, they're right--I *should* stop being racist!\n\nPeople post these things to let their followers (people who agree with them) know what a good person they are. It makes them feel good. But it accomplishes nothing. \n\nSo I work with a couple bigoted pricks. Jews and banks, 13/50, the IQ gap, Trump, adrenochrome, women suck, Tim Poole, the whole schebang. The thing is, despite their shit political views, they're actually pretty fun to talk to, and I'm not *friends* with them, but I treat them like human beings despite making it clear their politics are wrong... But I engage with them. If most of the people I saw on Twitter met a person like this they'd raise hell and get them fired from their job, but I genuinely think it's important to engage with racists as if they're normal human beings. \n\nSlowly but surely, I'm whittling at their racism. I dunno if I'll ever do it, but I think that being probably the only pot smoking, guitar-playing, bdsm-participating pansexual leftie to treat their politics seriously is going to change their minds on what the left is all about. *I got them to admit that poor white people perform just as bad on IQ tests as poor blacks, and ditto for middle class and rich black and white people*! To me, that's a huge win! I don't disagree with most of the points they make, just try to reframe them in a way that... Isn't racist. It sounds worse than it is. It's like, when they say \"Jewish\" people are destroying the world, I say, \"well what about all the white and black and asian and latino people destroying the world?\" And I think that will resonate. Marx said that the *entire* working class has to come together to destroy oppression (not a direct quote), and I truly believe we're in an era where lefties and righties see that the elite are the enemy of progress. You just gotta get somewhere close to the same page. My dad's a trump supporter, I'm a regretful biden voter (because who the fuck else was I going to vote for?) We both agree that he pays too much in taxes. He complains taxes should be cut; I complain that if he was making four times as much as he did he wouldn't have to pay taxes at all, and he totally agrees. We all hate the same people, and that's how you combat racism.\n\nFar right ideologies prey on your insecurities (well, not *your* insecurities) and they give a way for sad white losers to feel like, at least they aren't the *worst* losers by speaking from platitudes on civilization and shit. All that is a distraction from the world at large. If we can frame their political dissatisfaction from a place where we can show them that somewhere in leftism, and especially anti-authoritarianism is a place for their concerns to be heard if they just give up the racism, we can truly make the world a better place.\n\nIn conclusion/TLDR: hashtags don't stop racism. Making friends does. Next time you meet a racist, think, who wants me to hate this person?",
