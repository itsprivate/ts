People who are medically unable to lose weight or anything that makes them considered obese are exceptions to this, because obviously, they are unable to physically do anything about it.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s begin:</p>\n\n<p>What is Fat Acceptance? From my understanding, Fat Acceptance is an ongoing movement that supports obese people and claims that society is biased and mainly only accommodates skinny people.</p>\n\n<p>I. Fat Acceptance hurts physical health.\nMany studies conclude that being obese is actually a medical condition, or rather a disease. This “disease” can cause numerous heart issues, diabetes, and even cancers. I don’t understand why accepting this disease helps in any way.</p>\n\n<p>II. Fat Acceptance does not contribute to society even if it is accepted.\nHypothetically, if being fat was the normal, would it really help humanity? A good example I like to use is the movie WALL-E. In WALL-E everyone is obese because they don’t do shit and everything is spoon fed to them. Do we want society to be lazy? Are we supposed to live driven by Coca Cola and burgers? What kind of life is that?</p>\n\n<p>III. The ignorance of fat acceptance is to hide the true fact: Obesity is not a good thing.\nMany obese people will hide the fact that obesity isn’t good. In order to solve this epidemic, we first have to acknowledge it, instead of hiding the real truth.</p>\n\n<p>IV. Fat-acceptance is the wrong step towards solving the obesity problem.\nAccepting to give up on having a healthy body is not going to solve the fat dilemma. There are many ways to help people overcome obesity.</p>\n\n<p>V. Arguing that “fatism” is on par with racism and homophobia is absurd.\nFatism is an indefinite state, meaning you can change your weight. Racism and homophobia are static changes which means they don’t really change.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
