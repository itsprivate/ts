Rituals gave people something to feel good about, and everybody following the same religion gave them a sense of community and purpose. If people didn't believe working towards a common goal with others gave them something to look forward to, even if that was in the afterlife, they wouldn't have done as much for the common good.

Without purpose, we would instinctively survive with as little as possible. We would be born into our tribe, be assigned a job to do for all of our survival, and do that until we die. With massive amounts of people working together, many were able to do things other than hunting or farming. This allowed humans to build towards bigger and better things, take time to discover the many uses of the land, resources, and many other practices that contributed to the betterment of their society, and humanity as time went on. \n\nOn a more controversial note, when we got to warring empires (mostly for religious reasons), each society was doing what they could to be better than the others. As much as we abhor war in modern day and look down on things such as the crusades, being better than others to prove your gods are mightier contributed to bettering societies. Naturally competition led to a constant one upping of each other and ultimately the betterment of humanity with these new technologies and practices.\n\nIf we come down to it in modern day, political parties are becoming modern religion. We have started denying God more and more because our society has become built on providing evidence first before accepting a theory (which is good imo). It may be time for religion to go, but humans are just shifting that focus to another aspect of life. Political parties as they currently stand are a modern take of governing, much like your religious moral codes that governed ancient societies. Since we don't have the community connection that came with religion as much anymore, it has caused polarization of politics and people have started to be righteous about their beliefs and see the other as misguided while gravitating towards people with their same beliefs. \n\nI feel like I could write an essay about this but I won't cause it's Reddit.\n\nTldr: Religion is the reason for society and it isn't going away, it's just shifting",
