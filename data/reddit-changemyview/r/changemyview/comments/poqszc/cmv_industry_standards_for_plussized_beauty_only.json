  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Plus-sized modeling has become a mainstream source of women&#39;s fashion , but where are all the plus-sized men models?</p>\n\n<p>I was watching Hulu yesterday when an advertisement popped up showing a group of plus-sized women dancing for an Old Navy commercial. I was thinking about the commercial for a brief moment and it occurred to me, &quot;How come I&#39;ve never heard anything about plus-sized male models?&quot; Surely they must exist. I proceeded to do a quick google search of &quot;plus-sized models&quot; on my phone. I found out that 98% of the photos on google image were of plus-sized female models. I went to <a href=\"https://TheBodyPositive.org\">TheBodyPositive.org</a> and you can see from the main photo on their website that about 40 girls were in the photo and about 3 guys. I looked up some podcasts regarding body-positivity and the only ones talking about it were women.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe males don&#39;t agree with what standards we should define beauty by or it&#39;s possible that we simply ignore the notion that larger sizes can be attractive. In any case, I found my observation to be quite intriguing and I&#39;m curious to hear other opinions about it.</p>\n\n<p>And for all the haters, I just want to say that I have nothing against promoting positive body image regardless of how skinny or fat you are.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
