As someone with a younger brother who is against the vaccine it bothers me to see posts celebrating the death of victims. He has been for lack of a better term “brainwashed” by the media and my family tries to change his mind but he is with us about 2 hours a day and at school with people who share his beliefs for 8 hours a day (ty Florida schools). It’s easy to fool someone it’s hard to convince someone they’ve been fooled and I’m sure many parents and siblings tried to warn their loved ones but were unable to save them and I imagine some of them have seen posts of people celebrating/being excited that another nonvaxxer has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I did not make it clear, i think it’s ok to make jokes but posting someone’s photo and just their death being the punchline is what I have an issue with.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
