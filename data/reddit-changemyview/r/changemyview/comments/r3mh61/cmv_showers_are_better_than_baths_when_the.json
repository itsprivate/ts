If you&#39;re looking to relax, or soothe your  muscles for instance, then I get the whole bath thing. I&#39;m pretty sure baths are really good for exfoliating skin as well. However when we are talking about cleanliness I would argue there&#39;s no comparison. Showers evenly distribute water over your body while efficiently mixing with soap to break apart oils, dirt, and sweat that are stuck to your skin. Plus in a bath you&#39;re kind of left to sit in the water that&#39;s now mixed with all the grime that comes off your body, as opposed to the dirty water being sucked down the drain when you&#39;re in the shower. Again, I&#39;m not bashing baths here, just saying when the priority is to get yourself clean, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even close.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
