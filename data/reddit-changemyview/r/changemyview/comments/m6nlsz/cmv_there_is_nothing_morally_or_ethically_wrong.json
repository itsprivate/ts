I unironically want to bring back the duel.\n\nI do not believe there to be anything wrong with two consenting adults agreeing to duel each other to the death. Nor do I think there is equally anything wrong with a consenting audience who are willing to pay to witness this match in a colosseum or other such sports arena.\n\nIt doesn't even have to have weapons involved. I'm in favour of all bloodsports in general. It could just be two guys duking it out with their bare fists (or girls). It doesn't even have to be to the death. A system could be easily implemented for opponents to \"yield\" or \"tap\" out, along with other strictly enforced regulation such as a team of paramedics on constant stand-by.\n\nThe commercialisation of gladiatorial combat would also create a lot of jobs (trainer, ticket seller, commentator, blood cleaner, blacksmith) and stimulate the economy with ticket sales and merch and the like.\n\nI don't think our current society's want to hide violence from the public as if it doesn't exist in the real word, is a very healthy idea, nor a very smart idea in the long run. People are going to learn about the world's ugliness sooner or later - at least this way they can be more prepared (both practically and mentally) for it. Plus, it's not as if anyone's forcing you to watch. If you don't like it, don't participate in it.\n\nAs for the argument that the \"normalisation\" of violence will only make people more violent on the streets, I would argue that the same can be said for just regular UFC or MMA. It's no different. At least this way, one can be provided with an outlet for their violent tendencies in a regulated environment. And, what? You think just because UFC has stricter rules, that means people will carry those rules onto the street when committing crimes? That they'll arbitrarily hold back just because the people on TV do? If someone wants to hurt someone, they will. That's the end of it.",
