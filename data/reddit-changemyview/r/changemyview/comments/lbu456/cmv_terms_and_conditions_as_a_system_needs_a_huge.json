After witnessing what's been going on with the GameStop stock drama I decided to learn more about it.

If a class action lawsuit was to be filed it wouldn't even see the light of day.  Everyone who downloaded the app and used it agreed to Robinhood's Terms of Service. And wouldn't you know it, deep within all the lawyer speak and tiny font and extremely lengthy list of things you blindly agree to is that:\n\nRobinhood has a right to adjust prices and not necessarily guarantee that the number it shows to be paid isn't what you'll be paid and among other things, you give up your right to filing a class action lawsuit for anything done with Robinhood.\n\nThis has been going on for decades.  \"Facebook has been selling my personal data to advertisers and profiting off of it!\" You agreed to it.  \"Twitter banned Trump because he incited  violence and that's not fair because he's my President and I love him!
