  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What I mean is, if someone says they have autism, but do not have any/enough of the symptoms of autism to meet criteria for that diagnosis, it is not &quot;gatekeeping&quot; to say they do not have autism. Diagnoses are definitions of diifferent types brains and/or different types of human suffering based on criteria that either are or are not met. That&#39;s how definitions work; if you don&#39;t meet the criteria, the definition doesn&#39;t apply to you.</p>\n\n<p>The one place where the gatekeeping argument makes more sense to me is in the context of self-diagnosis of conditions someone does meet criteria for; people rightfully point out that not everyone has equal access to mental healthcare. BUT! The legitimization of self-diagnosis is a very, VERY slippery slope that ends with people:</p>\n\n<p>a) not taking responsibility for behaviors they actually do have control over</p>\n\n<p>b) over-pathologizing themselves/believing they are &quot;ill&quot; when they may not be</p>\n\n<p>c) deciding that this one diagnosis explains their whole identity, thereby missing the opportunity for deeper identity exploration</p>\n\n<p>d) ending up in my office (I&#39;m a therapist) insisting they have bipolar disorder when they meet none of the criteria but they have &quot;like crazy mood swings dude&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I get that people want to belong. I get that people are deeply longing for a sense of identity, meaning, and a way of understanding their struggles in a way that&#39;s not a moral/value judgment. But that conversation has no place in mental health; a disorder is a problem - you shouldn&#39;t want one! The gatekeeping argument has gone too far, and it has gone into the wrong territory. You can&#39;t &quot;identify&quot; as someone with diabetes; you either have it or you don&#39;t. Why should you be able to &quot;identify&quot; as someone with schizophrenia?</p>\n\n<p>TL; DR: the gatekeeping argument doesn&#39;t make sense in the context of literal healthcare where conditions are either present or they are not. I get that our measurement tools aren&#39;t as precise as they are in the rest of medicine, but we have to use the tools we have, which are the criteria literally designed to diagnose things.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
