But a crisis isn’t what causes change. You and most people already know that. \nIf you’re obese, you know being told that obesity is bad for you isn’t going to change fundamentally your day to day habits, thought processes and genetic factors influencing your weight. \nIf you smoke, you know it’s not extra big warnings on a pack of cigarettes that stops you buying the next pack. </p>\n\n<p>The things in this world that are utterly unacceptable to you - the straw that breaks your individual back and shifts your behaviour - will be ‘normal’ to the next generation, and ‘not that bad’ / ‘not my problem’ to a good chunk of your neighbours, colleagues and peers. </p>\n\n<p>Denial, cognitive dissonance and habit are stronger forces than reality will ever be. We already have enough research reports and ‘awareness’. </p>\n\n<p>Relying on your neighbours to be ‘ready for’ and ‘agreeing’ on dramatic change actions means we live in a society (ha) socially conditioned to think being hesitant, scared creatures of habit is fine, and it is ok to hide behind ‘waiting for more information’ over trying anything that carries any risk at all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
