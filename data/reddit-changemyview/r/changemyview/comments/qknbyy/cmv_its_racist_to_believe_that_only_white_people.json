I commented that thinking such was a great way to breed actual racism, not thinking much of it. I was banned from Facepalm and warned for harassment days later after not posting anymore on this account after that. Maybe there is something I&#39;m missing, but that thought process seems extreme, and the enforcement of questioning it seems extreme. Where did this narrative come from?\nI was the victim of a violent crime where my race played a heavy role. Without getting too far into the details, even in court &quot;racially motivated&quot; and &quot;racists&quot; were used on the young men who raped me. It&#39;s very triggering to hear that according to some people, I could not have been the victim of racism. Pinning those particular people as racist and full of hate instead of generalizing people has been a big healing point.</p>\n\n<p>What would the racial crime I experienced be called then? What is it called if a person of one race that isn&#39;t white is blatantly hateful to another person of another race that isn&#39;t white?</p>\n\n<p>There must be something I&#39;m not understanding, I&#39;ve been homeless and experienced violent crime and domestic abuse, but I don&#39;t pretend to know the struggles a person of color experience... Change my view please. I&#39;ve never been in legal trouble from my own actions and never ever been in &quot;trouble&quot; on Reddit ever, this seems worth asking.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I was genuinely afraid to ask because I didn&#39;t want to give hateful talk a possible platform. Just wanted to say thanks to anyone who touched this difficult subject and thank you for being civil</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
