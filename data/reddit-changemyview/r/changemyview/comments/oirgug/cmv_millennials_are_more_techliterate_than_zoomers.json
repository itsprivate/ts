  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I don’t buy the idea of every generation being more tech-literate than the previous one, especially praising zoomers as ’digital natives’. In fact, I think millennials vastly outperform zoomers on this metric. Sure, we might not use TikTok and other recent fads, but we had to do a massive amount of troubleshooting with way less user-friendly operating systems when we were younger. Nowadays, the trend is simplifying every functionality to make it as easily accessible as possible. Zoomers essentially play with colorful icons on touchscreens, and I legitimately know ones that don’t know where your downloads go or how to force close a running program.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, I think the educational system used to approach technology in a much more thorough fashion, when it was still something new. When using a computer, we truly started from the basics like left-clicking or right-clicking. Nowadays, teachers tend to believe in the ’digital native’ meme and just assume that every student has mastered the basics by default. I think this might end up harming them in the future!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
