They also constantly threatened to invade Taiwan and it seems to be only a matter of time until they do and if we ignore that Japan is going to be next and they&#39;ve already conquered the Philippines economically so then off to Australia and eventually they&#39;ll even come for Europe/NA.</p>\n\n<p>Internally China censors it&#39;s entire population, feeds them nothing but propaganda and controls them with a social credit score making their entire population subservient to their dictationship state not to mention it runs basically on slave labor of it&#39;s population and it&#39;s economy as it stands is basically the same as pre-war Nazi Germany with trade and property ownership somewhat allowed but the state can step in and seize whatever it wants at any time or force a company to make a purchase/engage in a contract ect. </p>\n\n<p>China&#39;s reversal of the 1 Child policy seems to be yet another indication they intend to go to war.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
