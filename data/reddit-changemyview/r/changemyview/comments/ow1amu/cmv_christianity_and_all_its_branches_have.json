I feel religion really but Christianity in particular has created just large amounts of close minded people who take their bible as fact. If you have something they disagree with and they can find something in the bible that backs them up theres no changing their mind. I feel like non religious people who trust science are always open to changing their stance in things because theres always more data and new research coming out. I think its wrong for people to use their religious text as fact, especially when they start trying to implement political policies that align with their point of view. I would really like my view changed cause it would give me a better outlook on this country (USA) honestly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
