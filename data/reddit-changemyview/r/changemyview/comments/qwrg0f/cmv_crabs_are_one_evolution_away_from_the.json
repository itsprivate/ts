If crabs were ever to obtain a biological ranged feature, they would be poised to become the ultimate life form. Consider a crab that could forcibly eject something akin to a stingray stinger.

Such as a starfish or snail. A ranged defense can engage these foes before they get close enough to hold on.  </p>\n\n<p>2) A large predator such as a ray or shark just bodies the crab and eats it. Large predators are easy to hit. Engaging the predator before it gets it eating distance would really help.   </p>\n\n<p>3) A small mobile predator out maneuvers the crab. Similar to the large predator, a ranged defense at least gives an ability to threaten the maneuverable predator.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There would need to be corresponding improvements to eyesight and such to support development of ranged abilities. Just to nip the easiest counterpoint in the bud.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
