He went on to explain that they reached out to Walmart for an explanation and were pointed to a 1800 number/customer care for further information which they believed to be a dead door. And this lack of disclosure was seen as further affirmation of their claim. \n\nI would argue that it’s not in the interest of any store (esp the national multi-chain stores whose policies are driven by centralized business-driven algorithms vs individual biases) to lock up any products — haircare for a certain population segment, condoms, shaving razors, baby formula etc — unless they feel they stand to take more losses from their theft than the profit from their collective sales. Asking to retrieve a store associate for a purchase discourages sale of any product and therefore takes away from the profits from that product. It also creates an additional burden to have enough store associates to go around for these needs.\n\nAs such, the decision to lock away “black” haircare products is likely a symptom of more pilfering of those products vs “white” haircare rather than racism on Walmart’s part. And the likely reasons Walmart didn’t share their fact-basis-driven-data is maybe that it takes away from their competitive advantage to share their stats out (retail inventory data can be a powerful tool) or it might encourage more thefts to see how much unchecked shoplifting occurs or it might be politically disadvantageous for them to provide data that stands to contribute to the narrative of black people being more likely to commit haircare theft crimes than white/non-textured hair people.",
