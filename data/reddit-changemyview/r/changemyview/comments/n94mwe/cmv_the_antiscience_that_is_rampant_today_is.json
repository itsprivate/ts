During the discussion the meteorologist went through all of the data cited and gave his counterpoints with data.

My sister in law was very anti-vaxx and would give my wife and I countless studies to read.  I remembering spending many many hours trying to find just one good article actually debunking the anti-vaxx movement and have very little if any success. Again I called on a friend to supply data, this time my friends sister who is an OB-GYN.

Needless to say my kids are vaccinated but unfortunately most people don't have close and personal access to people they trust that have information like this.\n\nThe significant problem is actually getting the real information.  Everywhere I looked whether it was reddit, or articles from the New York Times or any publication the argument always ended up at \"Trust science or you are both a moron and an asshole\".  This sentiment has actually caused my meteorologist friend to step out of his position in the academic world because he thinks people should be *encouraged to question everything* and then given the data in the best way possible in order to actually proliferate science.  His belief, and mine now too, is that if your argument ever comes down to \"Trust us(or 'them') we are experts\" than you are as anti science as an anti vaxxer.",
