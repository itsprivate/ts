Criminals and their cults are enduring prison time as it is now a rite of passage for some of them, organizations are ran behind bars, and at times it is prisoners who create dominant criminal organizations. Slaying these modern slave masters on sight should prevent experienced masters from passing their philosophy and experience to their disciples , and demonstrate that slavery isn&#39;t welcomed in modern times.
