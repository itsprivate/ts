Anybody in sales or marketing knows children are a goldmine when it comes to advertising receptiveness, and if they change their advertising to be gender neutral, it only opens up the possibility of more sales. \n\nOn a more emotion based note, I think every child has wanted a toy that’s “meant” for the opposite sex at one point in their lives. It wouldn’t kill boys to play with dolls and kitchen sets bc one day they will have kids and need to cook for themselves. It wouldn’t kill girls to play with GI joe’s or hot wheels as there are plenty of female car enthusiasts and even more female soldiers nowadays. \n\n Gender neutrality will open the child’s mind of what is possible for them in the future, therefore making a better balanced and honestly more productive society.
