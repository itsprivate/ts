It&#39;s like religious people have to completely shut down their brains to continue believing at this point which is nearly identical to a cult. Religion meets the definition of a cult by every definition I can find. Just because the majority people are in some cult doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a cult. &quot; It&#39;s funny how the right religion is always the one you grew up with. &quot; That is such a true statement I really don&#39;t see how anyone can believe knowing all that without being mentally delusional.
