They’ll never amount to anything and their 100 followers are also losers.</p>\n\n<p>While the concept of a celebrity pitchman/woman is long established, I&#39;ve never bought anything pitched by a celebrity, or social media app. You were paid to promote something? Good for you, I ain&#39;t buying it. Good product? Don&#39;t care, it&#39;s a cheesy way to reach people. And why should I trust your opinion anyway? If the product was that good and actually something I needed, I&#39;d have heard about it by other means. </p>\n\n<p>Are people so gullible these days they&#39;ll shell out for anything pitched by a Kardashian? Maybe, but the 100,000 Kim/Kylie wannabes out there? Get a fucking job because your TikTok is never gonna pay your bills. </p>\n\n<p>Your work is cut out for you peeps.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
