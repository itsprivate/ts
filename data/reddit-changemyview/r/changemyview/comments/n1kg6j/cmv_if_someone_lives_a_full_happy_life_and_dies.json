I believe if you died of natural causes at a very old age (Maybe 82 plus would be good for setting a standard if NEEDED) you got the full package that life offers you and while everybody has the right to be sad, I believe we should be talking about all the wonderful things about you and give the respective person a cheers to a long and happy life. I don't think the sad vibe should be culturally expected at a funeral in this instance. It doesn't make sense to have everybody be sad even if they were a saint because they got the best thing they could get from life that some don't. I feel crying at these events would be expected but the black and gloomy vibe should be dropped and should instead consist of toasts and celebration. I got this thought from a post a while back that mentioned their Grandma was the kind of woman that was a partier and always lived life to the fullest, sounds like she got the best life she could get. So they through more of a party type celebration of their life instead. Just seems like that'd be warranted, although I guess anyone can do what they want I don't think that expectation is helping mourners instead it's just making them sadder. Well, I've made my case and this is how I feel. Interested to know if my view will be changed. Oops mind the grammar lmao",
