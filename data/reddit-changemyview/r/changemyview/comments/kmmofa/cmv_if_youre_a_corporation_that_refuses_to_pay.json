Like, these folks have heard of modest living, right? Like, you don’t *have* to have your three houses in the Bahamas while your own employees are struggling to pay for their own home. I hope they know that. \n\nI think it also shows the failures of 21st century American capitalism and its current system. Say what you will about mid-century America (I’m not one to excuse it’s intense racism, sexism, homophobia, etc,.), but at least the CEO-to-employee gap was [a hell of a lot smaller](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianahembree/2018/05/22/ceo-pay-skyrockets-to-361-times-that-of-the-average-worker/) than what we’re seeing now. And these were corporations who could provide their employees with good pay and good homes (like the big three in Detroit and what not). There’s really absolutely no excuse for this to be as disparate and ridiculous as it is here. \n\nOf course, we also had a much stronger union presence, a presence that, I think, should never have died the way it has since the 80’s. It put these corporations in check to make sure that they’re doing their fair share, and their loss in our country has. Meanwhile, countries like Germany have *kept* their unions. You don’t see the ridiculous wage issues that you see here, do you? \n\nYet, even without unions, it’s also meaningful to raise the minimum wage, a law-mandated wage that was [literally built to support a decent living standard](https://theconversation.com/its-time-we-revived-fdrs-wages-of-a-decent-living-34344), not a teenage employee’s booze fountain. \n\nAnd before people say “Oh, just go to college!”: First off, how can you expect an 18-year-old high schooler to suddenly decide what they’ll do for the rest of their lives? Second, how do you know if that chosen degree will even get them the job they spent so much time and money for? \n\nAlso, why should a 20-something today be expected to live at their parents’ house (a house that might be abusive and shitty, mind you), when a 20-something 50 years ago could get a decent apartment with a less-than-extraordinary job at, I don’t know, K-Mart or something? Maybe even while paying for the (then extremely cheap) tuition? Again, don’t you think that’s a bit interesting in of itself? \n\nWhat I’m trying to say is: If you’re a big corporation that refuses to pay a living wage to your employees, you don’t deserve to be in business. \n\nOf course, I would like to see my views challenged.",
