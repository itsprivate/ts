Everyone has to be clean shaven except people who claim a religious exemption (and a handful of other exceptions). If shaving was really that important it should be required for everyone with no exception. Since it clearly isn’t, why not just get rid of the rule altogether? </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an example of a religious exemption that actually makes sense?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
