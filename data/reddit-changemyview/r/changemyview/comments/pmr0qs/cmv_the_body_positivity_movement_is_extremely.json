It practically encourages people to keep eating junk food and that it is okay to be obese and do nothing about it. The body positivity movement is probably already claiming lives because of extreme obesity. And on that note we should encourage people to lose weight, but when I said this to my friends they all said I am being an asshole and that it&#39;s very rude. But let me ask you this; imagine I fell into the trap that is body positivity, I might have already gotten diabetes or some serious health problems, but I became healthy and I&#39;m encouraging other people to lose weight, but I&#39;m being called an asshole. But they never gave an actual argument, so I&#39;m hoping if you disagree with me to change my view, I&#39;m open to listening</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
