I have no issue with undercover police who are in completely unmarked vehicles, but a traffic cop sitting on the side of the road in a difficult to identify vehicle does nothing to stop people from speeding rather only to catch one of the drivers speeding or driving recklessly. </p>\n\n<p>In my mind police cars should be painted bright colors that clearly say I&#39;m here, don&#39;t commit crime while I&#39;m here.  Imagine a police officer sitting in a parking lot in an all black vehicle versus a brightly colored one. He could be sitting on his lunch break or writing up a report (or eating doughnuts) and if he was in a brightly colored vehicle it wouldn&#39;t matter if he was looking around to see if anybody was committing crime because citizens would know much more easily that police presence is in the area.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
