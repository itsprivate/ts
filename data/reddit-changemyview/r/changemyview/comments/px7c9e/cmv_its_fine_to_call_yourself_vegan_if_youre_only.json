You must be into animal rights to be a vegan, and you must be very strict about it. If you aren&#39;t, then you&#39;re just &quot;plant-based&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>However, in casual usage, veganism refers to a diet. When people talk about vegans or veganism gets marketed in ads and media, it&#39;s always about the food. <em>Maybe</em> you&#39;ll hear that a soap or makeup product is &quot;cruelty free&quot; and/or &quot;vegan&quot;, but that&#39;s usually an add on.</p>\n\n<p>Dictionaries also refer to veganism as a diet. </p>\n\n<p>You go to the average Joe on the street and they won&#39;t know what they mean if you say you&#39;re &quot;plant based&quot;. They are more likely to understand if you explain that you&#39;re vegan.</p>\n\n<p>I obviously don&#39;t personally know all the vegan celebrities, bloggers, and YouTubers out there, but I don&#39;t know believe all of them are into animal rights. You only ever hear about the dietary element of veganism.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of vegans are in it for health or environmentalism, not the animals.</p>\n\n<p>To me, veganism is a stricter version of vegetarianism. Whether you believe in animal rights, and what <em>elements</em> of animal rights you believe in, is up to you. With me, I can support some parts of animal rights but not others. You can be a vegan and go to zoos, you can be a vegan and buy pets, you can be a vegan and own cats, you can theoretically even be a vegan and buy leather boots.</p>\n\n<p>How to change my view: Give me good reasons why using &quot;plant-based&quot; instead of &quot;vegan&quot; is preferable</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
