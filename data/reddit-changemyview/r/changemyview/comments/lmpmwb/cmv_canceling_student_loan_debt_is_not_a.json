  "selftext": "Hey peeps. I'm a progressive voter who supported Ilhan Omar and Elizabeth Warren (I'm in MN). I have a masters degree and about $20K in student loan debt. However I don't understand why canceling student loan debt is a progressive policy that is being championed by the likes of Warren, Bernie, AOC, and others. Change my view that this is a policy that won't address underlying issues with student debt but it will further divide class lines.\n\nI understand that total student loan debt (>$1.5 trillion) has now surpassed total credit card debt (<$1trillion) to become the second largest form of debt in America (after mortgages). I acknowledge that's a concern. This has been driven by increases in the costs of higher education, increased/eliminated caps on borrowing for students and parents, the rise in for-profit colleges, the increasing number of people attaining college and especially graduate school, and more.\n\nHowever, only about 1 in 8 Americans has student loan debt and the average amount is about $32K. While I understand that some people drop out of college and get the debt without the benefit, that is not emblematic of people who have student loan debt in general...an individuals who graduate college tend to make significantly more than those who don't (\\~$75K/year vs $45K/year). Additionally there are income-based repayment plans for student loans that are an option which tie your repayment to your discretionary income and forgive anything you have left after a set number of years. Why should we cancel, on average, $30K in student loan debt for citizens who make, on average $30K more per year than non-college graduates?\n\nSo, again, why is canceling student loan debt seen as a progressive policy being championed by the likes of Warren and Bernie and AOC, etc?\n\nSomeone change my view that it would be more progressive and effective strategy to:\n\n1. Address underlying issues causing the increase in student loan debt. Simply canceling student loan debt simply resets our debt back towards zero but then it will start accumulating all over again. Congress needs to address how we got in this situation.\n2. Give every American a big ol' check. If someone wants to spend their big bailout on paying off a bunch of student loan debt, that's their prerogative. And if I want to spend it paying down credit card debt first, that's my choice based on my biggest need. And if a low income family wants to use it to buy a car to have reliable transportation to a better job, that's their opportunity to get ahead.\n\nIf we could lift every American out of poverty and provide universal healthcare and check a whole lot of other boxes then I'd be all for moving down the list to eventually forgiving student loans...but I don't understand or support why it's an issue that is getting so much attention now.\n\nForgiving student loans will disproportionately help middle and upper class Americans while providing no benefit to our most impoverished and marginalized citizens, and it will do nothing to address the systemic issues that created the debt in the first place.
