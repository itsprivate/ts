Christianity has Jesus who was completely peaceful and got crucified by the Romans for claiming he was the king of the Jews. The early church was martyrs in the Roman empire who were non violent. Similarly with Buddhism, Buddha again was a pacifist and so were his early followers. Let’s try this with Islam. Did Muhammad kill people? Yes. Did his early followers who knew him wage war on infidels? Yes. Does the Quran literally say to <a href=\"https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;verse=191\">kill all infidels</a>? Yes</p>\n\n<p>The issue I have is not necessarily is people saying Islam is peaceful (even though it isn’t), it’s people calling you islamophobic for saying so. I don’t hate Muslims and in fact I enjoy aspect of their culture like food, their advances to science, and calligraphy. But it’s not super difficult to see that Islam if followed closely is not a religion of peace. In fact I do believe the Taliban are exemplary followers of Muhammad. People like to say that Christianity is worse but like I claimed before those who have killed in the name of Christ completely contradict the beliefs of Jesus saying to <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-18.htm\">not kill</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I do not support discriminating against peaceful muslims but I think believing that violent muslims follow Muhammad’s teachings and actions are following Islam correctly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
