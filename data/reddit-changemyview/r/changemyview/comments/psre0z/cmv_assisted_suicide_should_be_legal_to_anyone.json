My reasoning is simple, we should have autonomy over own bodies so we should decide how and when we die. You don&#39;t have to be mentally ill to be suicidal. Sometimes life can just suck and your circumstances would make any normal person want to end it all. Sometimes things get better, sometimes they don&#39;t. Assisted suicide would help people get out of any pain that they were suffering from. Assisted suicide would also give people access to painless procedures.</p>\n\n<p>If we as a society really do believe in freedom and personal autonomy then we should legalize suicide and give people a safe, human, peaceful, and painless way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
