I felt extremely used when they ended things with me and dropped the bomb that they felt they were aromantic since before we started dating. I had already established before that I date to be in a relationship. I feel as if people who are questioning their sexuality should disclose this to people they date because otherwise they rope potentially unwilling people into a situation. I would have never dated an aromantic person (or someone who is questioning) since we’re fundamentally looking for different things and have different expectations. </p>\n\n<p>At the very least, disclose this with potential partners and let them decide if they want to help you explore your sexuality.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
