Most of the degrees leave you unemployable, which forces you to get alternate and laterally useful skills on your own, which is why MOOCs are so popular.</p>\n\n<p>Academia, as it stands today, is a giant archaic clusterfuck and circlejerk for dumb but persistent people who work at a snail&#39;s speed and fail to upgrade themselves to become better researchers or teachers at any point.</p>\n\n<p>And especially in STEM, they love badmouthing industries in private even though they wouldn&#39;t manage to stick around any university without their grants. The race to publish papers just for the heck of it is completely tragic.</p>\n\n<p>College itself is overglorified, good education can and is free, or at least very close to being free. Young adults should save their youth and money and their backs from being crushed with debt, and just get skills that can land them well-paying jobs. The PhD, tenure track, the multitude of departments are all part of a broken and scarring system.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
