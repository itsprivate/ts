My initial few months of research suggests that governments (at least in EU) over-report their recycling figures and in general portray it as a much more effective, truly circular process than it really is. Recycling rates are calculated using extremely blunt methods (in the UK as a % ‘sent for recycling’) that don’t reflect the fact that a lot of scrap plastic is exported for recycling and gets incinerated or landfilled/dumped/burned/left in storage long term. \n\nCoupled with this, most plastic products are very difficult to recycle in a way that preserves the quality of the polymer and so they end up downcycled at most a couple of times before they become end of waste. It’s also currently more or less the same cost to buy virgin fossil fuel derived plastics as it is to by recycled plastics, which are of a lower quality. There isn’t much pressure on the producers to standardise or change their product design significantly and even the upcoming EPR consultation/plans seem like they will not be enough of a policy measure to change the situation in a radical way. \n\nEnergyFromWaste SEEMS to bet the best short term solution to get energy return on plastic waste if governments are unwilling to bring in radical legislation outlawing current practice regarding disposable packaging. However EFW plants aren’t 100% ‘clean’ either. At least they are a bit more honest.\n\nIn my view the overconsumption and pursuit of growth driving our culture is the key problem and essentially, whilst it does play a role, industrial recycling is closer to greenwash than a solution to the problem. Until there are radical policy changes that inconvenience all of us and force us to use refill schemes, buy less packaging, and generally own less stuff (and stop constantly buying new things to replace perfectly good things), the planet will continue to be damaged beyond repair.\n\nI know there are many ecological issues facing humans right now and plastic waste isn’t necessarily the worst. I just think that by grossly misrepresenting the reality of recycling through dubious reporting, marketing, and education, we are doing more long term harm than good. You can’t address a problem if you consistently tell yourself (the public) it doesn’t exist or that it ‘isn’t so bad’.\n\nI would love to hear your views on this and REALLY LOVE to be proven wrong. Particularly from anyone involved in this industry!",
