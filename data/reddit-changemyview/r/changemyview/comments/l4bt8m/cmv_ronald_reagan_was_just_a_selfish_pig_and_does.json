Tons and tons of rewards (surprised to get wholesome awards for a topic like this, but whatever)? Thank you guys so much!</p>\n\n<p>Lots and lots of back and forward regarding this topic. I didn’t even know the conversation behind this is still as lively as it has been here. I expected some upvotes and some comments here and there. Nope! I guess this topic still bites a lot of people  almost 20 years after Reagan’s death. </p>\n\n<p>So far, I did learn a bit more from this than I though, some good and some bad (forgot about the Contra scandal, crack, racism and what not). </p>\n\n<p>I can’t read them all and fully explore all the comments, so please forgive me if I’m slow to respond and/or give deltas! </p>\n\n<p>I will admit some faults in both my arguments and comments (the faulty Hitler analogy, the lack of other issues involved with my initial argument, my irrational stance against all Republicans, etc,.), all of which I should be more aware of in the future. </p>\n\n<p>So far, I still haven’t totally changed my stance on Reagan’s decisions and ethics. The homophobia, racism and scandals are just simply inexcusable in my eyes. I can, however, also kinda see why one would vote him on his economic stances back then, as devastating as their effects are to this day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
