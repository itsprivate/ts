However, I won&#39;t always return the favour. I don&#39;t do this out of spite or hate, I&#39;ll explain.</p>\n\n<p>If at any point in the post you think I&#39;m joking or making a parody of it, I&#39;m not. Sometimes I&#39;m just genuinely clueless and looking for an answer.</p>\n\n<p>I recently started my Master&#39;s studies in International Relations, which includes a course on sociology. I know, I should have seen this one coming, but in the first seminar we were reminded that we had to use &quot;inclusive language&quot;. So each and every time a fruitful discussion on the course material was held, but someone mentioned a word like &quot;mankind&quot;, we were corrected and were told to use &quot;humankind&quot; or &quot;peoplekind&quot;. Then later on, something was said about &quot;man-made concepts&quot; and again we were interrupted with &quot;human-made concepts&quot;. Later on &quot;black people&quot; had to be changed with &quot;people of colour&quot;. Ironically, I tested the teacher and he stayed silent when I used &quot;mother tongue&quot; instead of  &quot;native language&quot; as well as &quot;mother nature&quot; instead of &quot;nature&quot; so I guess it&#39;s a one-way street.</p>\n\n<p>I could go on and name more examples, but they were just disruptive and took the focus away from the topic. After a while I started to feel it internalise and I had to scan every sentence in my head whether it contained a gendered word or whatever and it was really annoying. I already have issues with my concentration due to ADHD and this really isn&#39;t helping.</p>\n\n<p>The next argument is that it also requires you to be up-to-date with every new iteration of a word that has been &quot;inclusified&quot;. This is especially harder when you&#39;re multilingual and have to keep up with multiple languages. When I was a kid I grew up with 4 different ways of saying someone has a disability. First is was &quot;gehandicapte&quot;, then &quot;invalide&quot; (disabled), then &quot;mindervalide&quot; (less abled) and now &quot;andersvalide&quot; (differently abled). </p>\n\n<p>Saying &quot;disabled&quot; in my native language is nowadays seen as borderline insulting, whereas in English it&#39;s still common discourse. Same thing with how &quot;black people&quot; was corrected to &quot;people of colour&quot;. The closest translation to that in Dutch is either &quot;mensen van kleur&quot; (incorrect Dutch) or &quot;kleurling&quot; which was the word used for black people during the Apartheid era! It would DEFINITELY get you stares in public! I still don&#39;t know what is wrong with saying &quot;black people&quot; because I really thought this was common discourse in English? It&#39;s literally the B in BLM?! Is BLM now &quot;problematic&quot; because it&#39;s not called POCLM? </p>\n\n<p>And it doesn&#39;t stop there because I also speak German and French regularly as well. I seriously have no idea if I can say &quot;un homme noir&quot; or &quot;schwartze Leute&quot; without getting death stares. I genuinely have no clue. Meine Freunde &amp; mes amis, help me out here.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m constantly having to figure out what the correct term might be, in different languages, while struggling with loss of focus and having to keep up with words that are fine today but that might be taboo next year. And to what end? What purpose does it achieve? Will black people honestly sleep better at night if we call them coloured? Will it ameliorate the injustices they face? Do we really bridge the gap between the genders by forcing all gendered expressions out of the dictionary? </p>\n\n<p>If anything, this language policing only divides us more and take away from the real issues. As long as we don&#39;t use slurs like the N-word and judge people on their intent rather than their choice of words, we can make much faster progress than endlessly forcing eachother to be the most modern thesaurus.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus question: should we then also get rid of the word woman? It&#39;s derived from man and therefore insinuates that women are derivates of men rather than being their own unique entity. In Dutch, there&#39;s &quot;vrouw&quot;. In German &quot;Frau&quot;. So do we then make a new English word based on Germanic roots? &quot;Frow&quot;?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
