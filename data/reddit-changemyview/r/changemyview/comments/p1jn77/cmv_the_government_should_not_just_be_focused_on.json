The global temperature has already risen, and it doesn&#39;t seem it will stop here. The Atlantic current is on the verge of collapse, Antarctica and Greenland is melting.</p>\n\n<p>For the next couple of decades, we will see an increase in flooding and severer weather. Which WILL impact coastal and agricultural specifically. By the time all the ice melts, there is going to be a lot of cities underwater, the world should be as a whole, start planning for that situation by either erecting sea wall or barriers.</p>\n\n<p>Agricultural-wise, despite our tech advancements, we have seen severe weather causing significant yield reduction, if climate worsens over the next decade we might see an all-around food price increase, which historically is tied to instability. </p>\n\n<p>It took us nearly 200 years to damage the environment to have the effects we have today. We clearly won&#39;t fix the damage in the next couple of decades. </p>\n\n<p>The entire thing just feels like a college student who hasn&#39;t been working on a project despite all the warnings, and the deadline tomorrow. While yes he should keep working because even half a product is worth some points, but the project is lost. He needs to focus on what he needs to do to pass the class instead of keep telling himself: &quot;the next 10 hours of my work will equal to the weeks that I wasted&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Idk, hopefully, someone in the comment can explain to me how we can salvage this cluster fuk within the next 30 years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
