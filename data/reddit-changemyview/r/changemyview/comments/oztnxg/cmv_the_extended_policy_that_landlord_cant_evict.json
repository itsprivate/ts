Also, doesn&#39;t the landlord also have to keep paying mortgage for all their houses while the tenant doesn&#39;t have to pay anything? This seems horribly unfair for the landlord because the property is still the landlord&#39;s, meaning the landlord pays property taxes on his property and bought the property.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
