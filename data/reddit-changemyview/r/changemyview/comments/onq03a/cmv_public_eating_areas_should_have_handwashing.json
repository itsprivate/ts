This makes it very inconvenient to wash hands on a regular basis, such as before eating a meal in a restaurant. I can recall a single restaurant that had a sink in the back hallway (in addition to sinks in the restroom), and I remember it being a great relief not having to use the restroom. This should be the norm in all public establishments, including restaurants, shopping malls and airports. </p>\n\n<p>By limiting sinks to the restrooms, these establishments make hand-washing inconvenient and most people skip it before eating. Not only do the patrons need to leave their party to wash their hands (one at a time), but they often need to wait in line for others to finish using the toilet. To top it all off, after washing their hands, they need to deal with the fact that other people using the toilet may not have washed their hands before touching the faucet or the door handle, leaving the chance that using the restroom sink actually makes your hands dirtier than they were before.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
