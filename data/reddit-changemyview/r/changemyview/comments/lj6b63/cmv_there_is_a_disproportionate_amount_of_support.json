  "selftext": "For clarity, I am a moderate but left leaning, secular male. I would absolutely describe myself as pro-women’s rights and equality for all, no matter their gender, race, religion, etc as long as their views are not hurtful to others. I am not here to debate whether Islam is a more violent religion than others. Rather, I want to specifically tackle why liberal minded, self labeled feminists refuse to acknowledge that Islam is the primary remaining religious group that publicly engages in repression of women’s rights, female genital mutilation (FGM), and condones rape. To be clear, I know that not all Muslims support these activities (obviously), but I do not understand why the liberal west has not chastised and called them out harder for Sharia law being a staple of their beliefs (https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#sharia-as-the-official-law-of-the-land)\n\nBackground: I was raised in MN, and spent my childhood with an abnormal amount of friends consisting of Somali and Ethiopian refugees, and their families. This was due to a large push from the Evangelical community to bring refugees into the US after desert storm (https://m.startribune.com/how-did-the-twin-cities-become-a-hub-for-somali-immigrants/510139341/)\n\nI have no formal political or religious education to draw on, but rather a lifetime of experience forging personal relationships with these people. Because of this, I feel like I am missing something when I relay my views to people on this subject. \n\nView:\nThere has been a large push in the liberal media sources over the last several years that almost exclusively promotes Islam in a positive light, as the religion of peace. Again, this is not a debate on terrorism, violence, or past history of these things. I’m specifically asking about the treatment of women. \n\nI have yet to encounter a single feminist in my own life (and they constitute the majority of women I know) who will acknowledge or admit that the reality is, in 2021, no other religion or area of the world gets away with the blatant mistreatment, oppression, and repression of women. \n\nThey tend to try and switch the narrative to topics such as “many women want to wear burkas” or other similar issues. \n\nI BELIEVE THAT REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MISTREATMENT OF THESE WOMEN SILENCES THEM EVEN FURTHER AND MAKES THEM FEEL AS THOUGH THEY HAVE NO ALLIES IN FREE WESTERN SOCIETY\n\nAs stated, I have had friendships or relationships with probably close to 100 of these refugee families. I have only heard one narrative coming from the women I have become close to in these circles:\n“Why are women here who enjoy freedom that most of my friends and family back home will never see, siding with tolerance of a religion that does these things to us. Please, save us from these parts of our culture”\n\nA quick search on Google for “Islam Oppresses Women” turns up a multitude of articles, almost exclusively stating that, “women in Islam don’t have it that bad, and it’s their choice that they want to stay”. This is sad, and false in my experience with dealing with these females. \n\nIf Christians and the US suddenly declared that women no longer have the right to or be subjected to:\n- vote\n- choose their clothing or expose any skin\n- be stoned to death when your husband cheats on you\n- married at age 9\n- have your genitalia mutilated\n- not allowed to work or drive cars\n\nThe entire world would turn against us and we would be exiled and excluded from modern economies and our allies would abandon us. \n\nSo why are so many feminists quick to defend them?\nThank you. This has weighed heavily on me for years and I need to hear other, well thought out views to better my own understanding of this issue.",
