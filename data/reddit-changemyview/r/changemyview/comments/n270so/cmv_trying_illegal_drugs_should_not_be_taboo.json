Medical professionals prescribing drugs don't have magical knowledge that doesn't exist - their knowledge comes from the same fairly elementary body of knowledge we've gained from studies (which are available and understandable to most intelligent laymen). Even on ads for well-studied drugs like SSRIs you'll hear the common phrase \"XXX drug is thought to work by...\"\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, mainstream medical proscriptions against certain drugs are heavily influence by politics, culture and public opinion. There are a variety of emotional and logical reasons society wants to keep people from trying drugs that are completely irrelevant from the position of individual happiness (such as an addict potentially being a nonproductive drain a capitalist country). This results in an incentive to publish biased or completely inaccurate information about drugs, a lot of which has been exposed with the campaign against marijuana.\n\n**2) It's likely that 21st century society is not ideal for stable mental function.** The society we live in today is vastly different than the relative unchanging hunter-gatherer societies our brains evolved in over the course of millions of years. It stands to reason that living in 9-5 job that society expects could cause chemical imbalances in the brain for even biologically typical people, let alone those with an underlying disorder.\n\n**3) Some people may need illegal drugs to be normal.** Just as some people are born with deficient sight or limbs, people can be born with deficient neurochemicals. Again, the brain is complex, but it stands to reason that production of endemic opiates in the brain, for example, follows a bell curve like every other human trait. Those in the bottom 2% of endemic opiate production would likely be over represented in the population of depressed and suicidal people. Such a person might tremendously benefit from an artificial opiate source to reach a normal level with the rest of humanity.\n\n**4) The chance of finding happiness if someone commits suicide is zero; The chance of happiness with illegal drugs is significantly greater than that.** I won't go into the exact percentages of functional people that use illegal drugs (almost any study would likely be subject to bias)  except to say that they obviously do exist, and in large numbers. If someone is imminently suicidal, a pill that will instantly make them feel what is it like to be HAPPY, perhaps for the first time in their entire life, has a good chance of making them reconsider. The downside, that chance that they could become a miserable addict, is still better than 100% certainty of never achieving happiness (suicide).",
