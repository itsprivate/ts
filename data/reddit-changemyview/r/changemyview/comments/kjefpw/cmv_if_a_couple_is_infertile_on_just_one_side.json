My reasoning is as follows:\n\nIf, as a couple, you agree to get a donor, one part of the couple doesn’t have any biological connection to the child. If the consensus is that it shouldn’t matter, and that the infertile person should love the child the same as if it were their own biological child ( a sentiment I agree with), then there’s an understanding in the couple that biological ties are not paramount in a parent-child relationship. Given this, it seems then that the other party ( the fertile one) should also be fine with not having biological ties to the child. And, in my experience, by having the child adopted you avoid some of the sticky pitfalls that can come with a donor situation. \n\nAnecdotally, I have heard of situations where one parent feels less obligated to be involved in the raising of the child because they’re not related. On the other hand, I’ve also heard of situations where the party that was fertile and is biologically related to the child gets a complex and believes they have more of a say in how the child is raised since it’s their flesh and blood. In a situation where the couple separates, it also makes things more complicated and unfairly weighted towards the person who is biologically related. \n\nPersonally, I’ve also seen situations where one half of the extended family treats the child noticeable different than the other and that can also be damaging for a young child to experience. With an adopted child, while there are certainly difficulties that a couple needs to be cognizant of, it just seems like there’s fewer ways for a weird dynamic to emerge and affect the child\n\nSorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile!",
