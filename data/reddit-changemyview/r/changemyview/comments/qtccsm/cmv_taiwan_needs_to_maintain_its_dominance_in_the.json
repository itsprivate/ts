  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a chipmaking company, accounts for 15% of Taiwan&#39;s GDP. The company has effectively monopolized semiconductor manufacturing by having the right infrastructure and talent. Its iron grip over the market has positioned the company as one of the most valuable in the world. As such, the semiconductor industry is incredibly dependent on TSMC for the mass manufacturing of complex chipset designs.</p>\n\n<p>While there has been companies that have tried to mimic the success of TSMC by developing their own foundries for inshore production, all have failed to find cost-effective measures to compete with TSMC&#39;s production capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The exorbitant cost of creating semiconductor foundries is one of the main reasons why there are so few manufacturers to being with, as the upfront investment to build a foundry can cost upwards to $20 billion. Since Taiwan&#39;s TSMC has the infrastructure readily available and has made the necessary investments to maintain the foundries, semiconductor companies have chosen to save cost by outsourcing the complex manufacturing entirely to TSMC instead.</p>\n\n<p>Due to excessive demand for its services, TSMC has not been able to keep up with production. Hence, the company has earmarked $28 billion to expand its capacity. One such technology, ultraviolet lithography, would allow it to accelerate the manufacture of microchips.</p>\n\n<p>There is no doubt that Taiwan stands to gain more than just market share by maintaining their dominance over the semiconductor industry. Since the world is dependent on TSMC&#39;s foundries, Taiwan can use it as political leverage, which is especially valuable due to the country&#39;s ongoing conflict with China.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, Taiwan will continue to expend a large amount of money to maintain its advantage over its competitors. There is too much to lose if TSMC lose its grip over the market.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize for my English. I am still learning how to write at a professional level, so there may be a lot of grammatical errors.</p>\n\n<p>If you do see the errors, then please correct them in my comments and the OP. I want to improve my English writing skills.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
