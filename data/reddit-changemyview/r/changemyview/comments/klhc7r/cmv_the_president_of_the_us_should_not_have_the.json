Regardless crimes committed against the United States should be forgiven by the United States, not the head of an executive (not monarch) branch of government. While I offer no solutions for it, I still believe this is not a power that should be unchecked. There should be some sort of balance with the power to prevent blatant corruption.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
