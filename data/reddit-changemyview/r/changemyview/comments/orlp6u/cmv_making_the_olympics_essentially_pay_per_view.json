It is impossible to legally watch the Olympics without paying for some service first, and that absolutely wrecks any enthusiasm I might have had for the Games.

I broke down and signed up for Peacock (NBC&#39;s new streaming service) because they advertised that they were streaming coverage, only to find out that paying for yet another service wasn&#39;t good enough for full access.  My wife is a horse person and loves the equestrian events, but those weren&#39;t included.  Why?  Probably because I needed to be punished for not having a cable subscription.  It is so sad and totally unnecessary.  I guess it is pretty American to suck every penny of profit out of something, but when that something is supposed to be &quot;national pride&quot;, I feel that is a step too far.</p>\n\n<p>*edit* - typo</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
