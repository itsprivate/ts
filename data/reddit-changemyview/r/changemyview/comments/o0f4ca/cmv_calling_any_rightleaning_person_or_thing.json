I also particularly notice this on things like supporting Trump - trump supporters are automatically labelled racist extremists and fascists when in reality most are just regular folk (though I must admit that I have only met a very small number of pro-trump people, as I am not American and in my country we generally disliked trump well before he came to political prominence - I am just skeptical to think that about half of the USA are actually the way they are portrayed on reddit).\n\nOne thing you have to be aware of, especially in the current political climate and if your views are fairly far from centre, is that assumptions, reasoning, and logical steps that you will take for granted just dont apply to a lot of other people. I know and have befriended lots of people who diametrically oppose my politics and there are a few I can have really interesting discussions with, and whilst I often very severely disagree with them, I can see how their particular situation brought them to their conclusions. And so the best thing you can do to actually have a constructive conversation about this is to empathise and appeal to that line of thinking.\n\nWhat not to do is to just see that they have come to a conclusion that you don't like and just assume that they are the worst version that they can possibly be. Sure, overt xenophobia is a lost cause and folks who practice that should be condemned because they aren't reasonable. But to go back to the example of trump supporters, seeing only the crazies that invade the capitol building and tarring them all with the same brush is absolute nonsense.\n\nTo me it is exactly the same as people on the right claiming that e.g. universal healthcare is communism, or that people who want better wealth equity or racial justice as communists. They're not. Sure, there are some tankies in there, and from my point of view they should be ignored and condemned too, but when I see the entire left being tarred with that brush I just think it's an absolutely nonsensical and bad faith put down to try to avoid any actual discourse and instead just try to say \"other side bad\"\n\nRemember - the folks who say that are also getting algorithmically fed only the examples of the very worst of the left such as destruction left by BLM protests and the least intelligent amongst the community. That's what they're fed of the left, and we know that we're not actually like that. So don't ignore that self-awareness and extend it to the folks on the right too.\n\nEdit: I realise that I am speaking to a primarily American crowd, but I used trump as a contemporary example and this point is not explicitly about him. Trump himself could ostensibly be labelled as fascist, but the point I am making is that being very slightly right of centre and voting a certain way because it's your party and it aligns with your tax policy is not the same as being far right and voting trump because you hate black people and he will stop immigration. I know that the US electoral system bunches these people together, but that does not mean they're all the same.",
