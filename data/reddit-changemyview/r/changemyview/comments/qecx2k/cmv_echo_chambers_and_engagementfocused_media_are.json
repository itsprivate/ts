I don&#39;t want to dwell on who&#39;s right, because my concern isn&#39;t about right or wrong, but about our ability as a society to live together with these growing differences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Politics</strong> - In the USA there you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/animation-rise-partisanship-congress-house-representatives-60-years-2016-4?jwsource=cl\">see</a> how the party-line voting and partisanship increased in the recent 20 years. The situation is also strikingly similar in my country - Voting outside your &quot;block&quot; becomes increasingly irregular. At the same time, the conversation and arguments become increasingly aggressive and hateful. This divide also translated to what the common voter of either party thinks of a voter of a different party. The divide is so great that it even affects family and friends&#39; relationships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Science vs Anti-Science</strong> - The anti-science/conspiracy group is no longer a tiny minority. From flat-earth, climate-change-deniers, and vaccine-skeptics. There is a huge influx of people that deny and reject the specialists and the government or science-mandated facts.</p>\n\n<p>These are just 2 examples. But there are plenty of other subjects where I can feel a growing division.</p>\n\n<p>The major blame, in my opinion, lies in the way we consume the media nowadays:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engagement-focused sites -</strong> Sites like YouTube and Facebook are engagement-focused - They try to present you videos that you&#39;ll be engaged in. That often means that if you saw a left-leaning video you will see much more of these in your feed. Unsurprisingly, the more extreme the content you&#39;re viewing, the more engaged and outraged you might be. This exacerbates the problem - Even if you started with relatively pragmatic views, watching increasingly aggressive media/news will have an effect to make your opinion more extreme as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Echo chambers</strong> - Instead of relying on a central and mainstream news source, people create their own thought echo chambers. This relates to news sites addressed to specific demographics (e.g &quot;Fox News&quot; or &quot;Mother Jones&quot;) and sites in which you can pick and choose your &quot;subjects of interest&quot; like Reddit. These sites lock people in a reality in which everyone agrees with them, locking them into a positive loop in which every new content reaffirms and solidifies their opinion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I feel that every day it gets worse and we, as a society, become less pragmatic. Worse, I don&#39;t see any easy solution to this issue that doesn&#39;t involve heavy-handed internet censorship.</p>\n\n<p>Is this indeed how I think it is? Or do I get something wrong and isn&#39;t any worse than it has been in the past?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I&#39;d just would like to emphasize that this isn&#39;t USA problem - It is, in my eyes, global country. This extremism and devision seems to be increasing all around the world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
