As a latino in 2020 seeing all the police brutality and mistreatment really resonated with me, so I stood with the black community during the hight of the movement. But once Latinos, Muslims, Asians, natives, LGBT and other groups started advocating for our issue we were shot down by people saying that were stealing form the BLM movement. And as many other movements took place groupie took the ___ lives matter name and used it, Latino Lives matter, Muslim Lives Matter, Asian Lives matter, etc. Supporters of blm called us racist and belittling the movement for using those names. But they use the argument “it doesn’t mean only Black Lives Matter” yet when other groups use it apparently we can’t. And now u see people advocating for segregation from white people and other POC, the usage of slurs against white people and POC who think like me, and calling other black people the c word for differing from thought. And many white people encourage it bc they feel guilt for being white, just the color of their skin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
