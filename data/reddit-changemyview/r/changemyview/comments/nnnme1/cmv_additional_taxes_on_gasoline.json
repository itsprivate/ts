The most obvious and widespread first-order effect of increasing gasoline is the cost of transportation using ICE vehicles. Governments hope that higher gasoline prices coupled with incentives on electric vehicles will result in consumers shifting to EVs over time, reducing the dependency on fossil fuel. **My view** is that in the US, raising gasoline prices before viable alternatives are ready is jumping the gun because it disproportionately hurts a family who cannot afford an EV. I believe there are better ways of spending the money than giving it to a family earning $249k\n\nTo substantiate my view, I will offer what I believe to be a more sensible counter-proposal to the expected US Federal Govt changes, which in brief are: gas taxes ($1-2 extra per gallon, and more over time), and EV incentives ($7k point-of-sale discount for those earning less than $250k) via the infrastructure plan.\n\n1.

A few example values; $50k income = 10k incentive, $100k = $7k, $150k = $3k, $250k = $0. *Note: There are challenges with conflating income with wealth / purchasing power, but for the sake for this argument I will assume that's a solved problem in the proposed federal plan that uses $250k as the cutoff.*\n2.
