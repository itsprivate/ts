Since they are the privileged group, period.\n\nNow with that being said, there are a few things that i want to get out of the way:\n\n-Dictionaries are NOT a good way to search for word definitions.\n\n-Meanwhile i argue that racism agaisnt white people is possible in america, i in no way belive that it is as harmful or strong as against other races, especially black people.\n\n-I do not belive that people who say that white people cannot suffer racism are ill intended, at least, not most of them (I do belive that some people say that just so they wont be considered racists themselfs).\n\n-The \"prejudice + power\" definition is controversial and isnt used as often as it was in sociology.\n\n-Some people will suport the idea that white people can be victims of racism to go against affirmative action, i do not suport them.\n\nThe point i see, is that many people have a problem with this topic beacuse they dont really know much about racism in sociology, or even racism in general (Im not saying i do know a lot, thats why i am here, so i can view oposing views and learn from them) , and often times people get really angry around this kinds of topics and end up never seriously discussing them, thats why this topic is so divisive.",
