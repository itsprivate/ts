In one of the episodes, the lady knocked off one of the guys even though he had a great pick-up line. This got me pretty pissed off and I went to see the comments. One comment accused her of being racist towards the guy as he was Black and the guy who won was white, many others agreed with said comment.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I hated her decision, I couldn&#39;t agree with the comment. Just because someone&#39;s personal preference might not include people from a certain race due to the way they look, that isn&#39;t racist. This is because racism is based on the principle that a person from one race considers another race inferior. When someone doesn&#39;t prefer a prevailing fatial feature of a race, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t respect said race.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
