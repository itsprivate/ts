With this scale in mind, trying to force people to rewrite an entire language to fit the preferences of an extreme minority of the population (less than 5% of the US, for example, last I checked) is no better than what we&#39;ve done to countless cultures elsewhere around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>The Native Americans were savages because they weren&#39;t as technologically advanced as us.</p>\n\n<p>Black people weren&#39;t human because of their different appearance.</p>\n\n<p>Countries with different religions have been attacked for following those different religions.</p>\n\n<p>And now. Latin American people are transphobic/neogenderphobic/whatever the fuck people are pulling out of their asses, because they used gendered language.</p>\n\n<p>Question: Where&#39;s everyone&#39;s outrage over gendered languages from Europe or Asia? Surprisingly absent, as far as I&#39;ve seen. That, in and of itself, points to lowkey racism being a motivator behind this movement, in my opinion. But even if you just say &quot;Oh well we just haven&#39;t gotten around to those yet&quot;, it still doesn&#39;t change how harmful this movement is. It&#39;s modern day imperialism.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
