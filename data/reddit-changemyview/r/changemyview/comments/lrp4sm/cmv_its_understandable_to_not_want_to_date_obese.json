Now, let's assume you're looking to date people based on looking for long term relationships. If they're obese because of thyroid issue or other genetic issue, that wouldn't be good if you were looking to have children.\n\nAs well as: if it's obesity gained from emotional issues (such as SO dumping you making you feel unloved so you fill that hole with like ice cream or somethong) it's possible that they're not over them yet (possible not definite), so that could cause some unnecessary nonsense you won't be ready or willing to deal with. \n\nAnd possibly the worst one: lack of urge control.
