Objectively speaking, there&#39;s a lot to be proud of in this country</p>\n\n<p>They defeated the British Empire in revolutionary war to grant themselves independence from the most powerful nation on Earth at the time (Colonial Britain in reality were the ones who built the nation on hate)</p>\n\n<p>They won a civil war to abolish slavery (one of the true acts of evil in modern times)</p>\n\n<p>They played a key role in winning WW1 and WW2. In WW2, they beat two of the most evil empires to ever exist and instead of conquering a severely weakened Europe and East Asia, they had mercy to help them rebuild and even became allies afterwards. Not to mention, they haven&#39;t engaged in warfare with another powerful nation since becoming a superpower unlike all the &quot;great powers&quot; who came before them</p>\n\n<p>They outlasted all of their Marxist rivals from the Cold War era as most of them have either dissolved (USSR, East Germany, Czechoslovakia) or been drastically reformed (China, Baltics, Vietnam, Romania) while US still remains the top economy</p>\n\n<p>US leads many modern global initiatives and have played a big role in helping poverty, hunger, and disease rates plummet around the world in recent decades.</p>\n\n<p>US is responsible for several of the world&#39;s most innovative creations such as the internet, microwave, search engines, computers, cell phone, online shopping, air conditioning, airplanes, emails, and of course, putting a man on the moon</p>\n\n<p>US is also a leader in medical breakthroughs (vaccines, new medications, etc.), business, technology, entertainment, and sports which have all impacted the world in a positive way.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even a giant patriot myself, but I had to get this off my chest as I&#39;ve been hearing so much slander on the country recently</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
