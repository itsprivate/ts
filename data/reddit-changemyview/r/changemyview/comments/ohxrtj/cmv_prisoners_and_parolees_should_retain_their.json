Yesterday, while reading about the case of the Texas parolee facing potential jail time for voting while on parole I couldn’t bring myself to justify my assumption that felonies should disqualify a person from voting. </p>\n\n<p>My new view on this topic stems from two main conclusions. First, we have way too many people imprisoned in the United States that don’t deserve prison and are just kept down by a broken system. Second, even if a person truly deserves to be held in prison, I don’t think that they should be denied representation in the government. I think that our government needs to represent both our incarnated members and our free members, otherwise we have a system in which the rights of incarcerated members risk becoming an afterthought to elected officials.</p>\n\n<p>Why should prisoners not be allowed to vote in elections?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
