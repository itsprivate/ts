Months of declaring the election was stolen, declaring that people must stop the steal, and so on, make that tweet disingenuous in my eyes.\n\nFurther, the DoD has now expressly refused to send the National Guard to handle the matter. One must remember the purge of civilian leadership immediately after the election and that it is Trump's appointed people making that decision.\n\nMy view is thus: Trump is staging a coup. Whether he specifically organized these particular people is irrelevant because this is all about keeping Trump in power. It's all he's talked about. Secretary Pompeo's words about a second term were not a joke. This is what Trump has inspired the far right to do and now they are doing it as I speak.\n\nI want to state right now that if some details of the above are marginally inaccurate, I don't care. The argument that this will not actually work does not mean a coup is not being staged. And god help me if someone starts trying to argue the definition of a coup. I don't want people arguing about semantics, basically. It is a tried and true pet peeve of mine. Otherwise I guarantee someone is going to come here and insist that because Trump isn't playing the card game coup that my view is incorrect\n\n*EDIT: National Guard apparently en route.

My view has reverted. Trump's video and subsequent tweets are not convincing with time to reflect. They weren't particularly convincing at the time, either.",
