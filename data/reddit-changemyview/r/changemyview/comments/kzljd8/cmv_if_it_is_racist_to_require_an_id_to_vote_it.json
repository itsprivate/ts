It’s almost the same requirements (18, not a felon), so I don’t see how you can call one racist and the other not. \n\nI use those two as examples because they are both enumerated rights within the constitution. \n\nTo be clear, I don’t think it is racist to require Identification in order to do either, I think that both are important and serious enough to justify identification.
