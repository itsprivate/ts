Embedded within this statement is a value judgement being made by a human actor according to their ethical or philosophical position, which is <strong>outside the purview of scientific inquiry.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Hume&#39;s is-ought gap &quot;arises when one makes claims about what ought to be that are based solely on statements about what is&quot;, and this example is a perfect exemplification of that fallacy. </p>\n\n<p>To be sure, people might incorporate scientific data into their decision-making process, however, that in and of itself is a value judgement which claims the information provided by the scientific method <em>should</em> be incorporated into such a process. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Science is descriptive, not prescriptive, therefore stating &quot;the science tells us we should do x&quot; is simply a category error and constitutes an is-ought fallacy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
