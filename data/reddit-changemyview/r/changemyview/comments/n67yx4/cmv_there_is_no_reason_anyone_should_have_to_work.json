Maybe that would help them actually cure cancer! \n\nMaybe this is more something to get off my chest...\n\nBUT, what is the point of anything when you really only have one day a week of your life from ages 21 until 65 to enjoy without guilt? It's not a resource issue - we throw away more food than we ever eat. There's tons of space - you could fit the US population in (albeit very densely populated) Texas, if I recall correctly. \n\nI was sitting under a tree on a sunny day with a breeze feeling safe and sleepy and I realized in the history of human beings that's about as good as it got for people. And you know what, that's friggin as good as it can ever get for anyone - rich, poor whomever. \n\nYou want a mansion or a boat, do you! But people should not have to work 2-3 crappy jobs to barely survive and then eventually knell over due to stress before they're 60.\n\nReally, please change my view! Cause I dont see the point. It's an arbitrary and antiquated system that pretends this a fair exchange for the life of a person. After centuries we figured out all the kinks for resource distribution! One bad harvest doesn't leave us starving! We can automate so much now! A human being wasn't created to sell shirts or hamburgers - people are unique and beautiful and deserve time to follow their interests and passions without sacrificing their ability to eat.\n\nWhat office job couldn't be done in 30 hours a week? Why is it crazy or lazy after hundreds of years of not being able to mass produce resources, figuring that out and then a hundred years of toiling in factories and coal mines, then automating THAT to STILL try to keep these ridiculous expectations? Why not push for people to be able to enjoy the limited time they have on this planet? Watch their kids grow? Create art? REST?",
