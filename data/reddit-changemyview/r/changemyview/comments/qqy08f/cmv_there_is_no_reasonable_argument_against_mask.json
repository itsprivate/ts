I did it myself. I let months pass and millions test the vaccines to see who would die or suffer (callous, but new medications are risky and I wanted to reduce the risk). After a while, it became clear that there weren&#39;t significant enough risks to wait.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the entire time, I stayed at home even when Texas law didn&#39;t require it. I wore masks and kept my distance even when not required (frickin Texas...). I took reasonable countermeasures to protect others from the consequences of MY choices. It&#39;s insane to me that people think they shouldn&#39;t have to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t have the right to drive on the wrong side of the road or drive drunk or blindfolded or using only chopsticks to operate the vehicle. You don&#39;t have these rights because it creates a significant and unnecessary threat to others. In the case of actually impaired people (one arm for example), they are allowed to drive only if they have equipment in place to compensate for their differences. I see no reason why mask/vaccine mandates are different.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, there will come a point where we have herd immunity (hopefully anyway) and/or tech and capacity to handle the smattering of cases in the future, but during the pandemic when we&#39;re stretched to the limits, it&#39;s completely reasonable to mandate safety (masks, distancing, staying home) and require either vaccines or that people work from home (if they can) or find another job if they can&#39;t. There&#39;s no reasonable argument I&#39;ve seen counter to this, but being a rational person requires that I investigate. That and there are so many people so frothingly bothered by this all that I&#39;m curious to know if I&#39;ve actually missed something. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time so, what is a reasonable counter-argument (assuming there is one)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
