I grew up in a world where this wasn't a problem as social media didn't really exist, but how do we know our kids won't hate the sea of pictures there are of them online when they become of age that they did not consent to. All my friends post so many pictures of their kids, which is great because they are proud to be parents, but I feel that if I was there child when I grew up I would be pissed at all these dumb and embarrassing photos. \n\n2. You are opening them up to exposure to the scummy parts of the internet, which is really the most disturbing reason. Anybody could grab pictures of your children and use them for whatever they want, this seems unsafe, even though your child isn't directly harmed, it is still a scary thought to think of anybody out there can see these pictures of your kids, especially the sickos on the internet. \n\nIf anything I would advocate for small private photo albums on Facebook or Instagram so maybe the grandparents can see pictures, but even then, what's wrong with giving people pictures at Christmas. \n\nI'm not advocating for mandating anything, but just that we should, as a society frown upon it. However I recognize not being a parent puts me in a position to not entirely understand that side of things. Please point out the things I may be missing.",
