I’m sorry if this edit is against the subreddit rules. \n\n\n\n\nEdit 2: Guys this kinda exploded within the last hour and I now have over 100 comments and quickly climbing to read. I’m still reading them and my view is still open to change, and has been altered to some degree. Please don’t take my long delay as a refusal to engage any further, I am alone at home taking care of my 4 year old son. \n\nAlso, please don’t spend money on awards for this thread I’m sure your money can be put to better use.\n\nEdit: I believe my view has been changed when it comes to things such as silencing political parties who are advocating for genocide, not only has that atrocity been felt in recent historical events but it’s been proven effective more recently in modern Germany. I’m still open to other comments regarding less dangerous views.\n\n\nFor clarification, I’m politically fairly centrist. I’d consider most of my views fairly left leaning but moderate, with a handful of them slightly more right leaning but also very moderate. I do have a different definition of what constitutes “hate speech” than many modern “ultra liberals” but I, too, don’t like to see/hear hate speech. \n\n\nNow for my position: I believe that silencing people, banning them from existing platforms, cancelling them, firing them, then shutting down platforms they create, for expressing their own opinions, while this may be legal, will ultimately have a disastrous ripple effect on our society. If you believe your opinions to be correct you should let them stand on their own merits and silencing opposition should not be necessary. Doing so creates even more of a divide, creates more resentment, and pushes those who believe differently into a dark corner where their views are never challenged because it’s the ultimate echo chamber. It does not change minds, if anything it reinforces beliefs. \n\n\nI understand that freedom of speech refers to freedom from government persecution. That is not what I’m arguing about. I understand this is not happening. We, as society, can shun and ignore what we believe to be incorrect backwards thinking without silencing it, and this would be a better way of dealing with it.",
