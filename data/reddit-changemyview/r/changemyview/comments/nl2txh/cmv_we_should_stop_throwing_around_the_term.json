  "selftext": "I believe \"socialism/socialist\" is a fuzzy term, at best, that often derails what could otherwise be useful political debates in the United States. When people on the political right say \"socialism,\" they typically have in mind a poorly-run welfare state at best and brutal totalitarianism at worst. I realize this is due to lingering effects of the Red Scare and our right-biased Overton Window, but it is the case regardless. On its own, this should be enough to discourage the use of this term if only one side of a debate really knows what it means, but I think it goes deeper than that.\n\nI also find that liberals and people who lean politically left in the US often have a fuzzy conception of \"socialism\" as well. They tend to lump AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Nordic countries all under this \"socialist\" umbrella, when what all of these have in common is *social democracy*, not socialism. Places like Sweden and Norway operate with capitalist economies and most of what AOC and Bernie push for is completely compatible with capitalism, albeit in a modified form.\n\nWhat I think is happening is that when people say \"socialist\" in the positive sense in the US, what they probably mean is *Keynesian* (i.e., the government doing stuff). That is, the focus tends to be on the role of government and social programs more than workplace power dynamics (e.g., labor vs. the owner class) and the fundamental incentive structure of the economy. To my understanding, basic socialist ideology is agnostic to the role and structure of government, ranging from radically democratic to decidedly-NOT democratic (hence why the left tends to split off into so many factions).\n\nI am not merely making this argument from the abstract \"words mean things\" stance (though this does partially motivate the argument because, of course). Controversy and lack of clarity have real world impacts on public views and political behavior. For instance, Americans broadly support progressive, social democratic labor laws, such as expanding the power of unions ([https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/labor\\_unions.pdf](https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/labor_unions.pdf)), whereas most Americans by and large tend to dislike things that are labelled as \"socialist/socialism\" ([https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/287459/public-opinion-review-americans-word-socialism.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/287459/public-opinion-review-americans-word-socialism.aspx)). \n\nIn conclusion, I am not arguing for the literal censorship of the word \"socialism.\" Furthermore, I understand that words and concepts morph over time; however, I would argue that in the US \"socialism\" has evolved into splintered meanings, depending on political community, without consensus, making it a bad word for political debate. Thus, I am making a pragmatic argument -- we should avoid using a term in our discussions and debates that is misunderstood, loaded, and, in my opinion, beyond salvaging in our political context.\n\nChange my view.",
