Let's see you keep that same energy next time a terrorist attack happens and you're screaming \"Not all Muslims\"\n\nTo clarify I think both are legitimate arguments. It's the hypocrisy I hate. Why should I be held accountable for the crappy actions of a few people. I've seen a lot of people using the \"not all sharks eat people\" argument to try to discredit the \"not all men argument\", however this argument doesn't hold up. Yeah sure not all sharks eat people. So it's on you to learn to tell the signs of which sharks do eat people so that you can avoid them. If you're too scared to swim in water that have non man eating sharks in then that's on you. You shouldn't expect the non man eating sharks to change their behaviour to suit you.  In the same way you should look for the signs that somebody is gonna be a bad apple and avoid them. Don't expect the good apples to change for you.\n\nEdit: this is in regards to men saying \"not all men\" in response to being held accountable of rapists actions. Not being accused of rape. Please make this distinction before you reply. I know no women say all men are rapists but a lot say it's up to all men to stop it. \n\nEdit: Damn the man haters really came out in force thinking I somehow support rape. I'm just saying these arguments are both as legitimate as each other. You can't say one and discredit the other. They are both generalizations.",
