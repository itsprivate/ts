I work in education, and ours go even further, asking \"Have you ever had your contract non-renewed?\"\n\nTo me, this seems fundamentally unfair. Lots of people have been fired from  jobs for stupid reasons, or have been fired because of bad bosses. Lots of people have not had the greatest work ethic as teens and been fired from dumb teenage jobs completely unrelated to their current profession. Also, isn't being asked to resign a way to avoid being fired? Isn't that the whole point? What are you supposed to do if you just aren't good at your current job or don't like it there? Lastly, being charged with a crime doesn't mean you did the crime, so I don't understand that one at all. What if you didn't do it?\n\nI don't understand why your employer can't just do their due diligence and background check you for criminal stuff and call your references for employment-based stuff. It seems like you need to be the perfect employee to even have a shot at the job, and that your mistakes never go away.",
