Physical attraction is a huge part of a relationship and is very important (looks do matter). Anytime a woman says she prefers or will only date 6’0+ men, short men will get pissed and act like she’s the biggest bitch in the world (which is an obvious projection of their insecurities). If you’re not attracted to men below 6’0, then you shouldn’t have to date them, the same way a man shouldn’t have to date an obese woman if he doesn’t find her attractive. People can have whatever preference they want, even if it’s ridiculous, as long as you aren’t shallow towards people who don’t fit your preference. It’s not just easy to “look past it” and find other things thst make up for it, it’s ok to have things you’re solely attracted to.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
