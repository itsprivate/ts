I'm half Finnish, a nation that currently has a multi-party coalition government and therefore has the ability to balance traditional values from both the right and left of politics. Finland's healthcare and education systems (both tax funded by the way!) are enviable to many countries but it's also is a very innovative country when it comes to developing business and technology which is benefitted from having capitalist elements ingrained in it's economic and tax systems. It is possible to have a government - either one party or coalition - where the vast majority of people can be happy with, but the extremes of the modern day two party system makes it impossible, and it will only get worse the more people are left behind as centrists and the politics becomes more extreme.",
