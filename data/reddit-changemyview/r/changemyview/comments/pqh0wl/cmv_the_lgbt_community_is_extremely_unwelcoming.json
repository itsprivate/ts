However, I personally have found that the LGBT+ community is extremely unwelcoming/unaccepting to anyone who doesn’t fit within its certain boxes. </p>\n\n<p>Aspects of this have always existed like members getting mad at bisexuals who are “straight-passing,” the validity of demisexual being questioned, accusing questioning people of being disrespectful towards the community or faking for attention. Recently, especially among the younger generation, there just seems to be a lot of gatekeeping. I’ve countless times seen online that someone identifies a certain way, but doesn’t fit perfectly into the rigid community set “rules,” so they get tons of hate comments from LGBT+ members. Every comment is negative and no one is ever accepting which is ironic since the community used to promote “acceptance” as being one of the core values. Seems the new goal is to preserve the label purity of current members and keep out anyone questioning.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I recently got online hate from the community for identifying as straight which is a new one for me. I’ve never fully fit any label and any attempt to define myself has been met with the same gatekeeping. I ended up just giving up on labels, but I chose “straight” as my official answer to “what’s your sexuality?” years ago since I felt I wasn’t accepted by the LGBT+ community. Now I’m even being gatekept from being straight by LGBT+ members. I don’t understand why people care so much about how someone else chooses to (or not to) label themselves.</p>\n\n<p>I really want someone to CMV because I hate that I now associate the community with negativity and gatekeeping. I fully support individuals and the community when it’s actually being positive and helpful, but the negativity is draining. I don’t think my view is unique either as I have found that most of my real life LGBT+ friends also don’t associate themselves with the community or rigid labels.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
