My fiancee is 100% white (for lack of a better term).</p>\n\n<p>We were all playing golf and saw an older Asian couple playing a second round.  The course attendant asked if they paid for a second round.  They said they didn&#39;t think they needed to since no one else was using the course and already paid once.  He said they can&#39;t do that, they paid for 1 round and only 1 round.  They were free to play again, they would just have to pay for another round.  I would think once you got caught, you&#39;d say &quot;my bad&quot; and leave the course, but apparently the guy had to keep explaining why they can&#39;t play for free just because there&#39;s no one behind them.  They were still talking by the time we got to our car and pulling out like 5 minutes later.</p>\n\n<p>My mom said something along the lines of &quot;That&#39;s such a Chinese thing to do&quot;.  My fiancee said we can&#39;t say things like that, because it personally offends her.  I&#39;m confused how someone of an unrelated race can be personally offended on behalf of another race for something said within that race.  I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I&#39;ve also played extra holes at a course.  But you do that in the middle like holes 5-7.  And if I got talked to about it, I&#39;d take the rightful blame, say I was in the wrong, and leave.  I&#39;d never start at hole #1 like this couple did, that&#39;s just asking to be talked to by the staff.  It&#39;s also very obvious when last tee time is 7-730pm, and this couple is starting at hole #1 at like 8:30pm.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit:  I said it below in another comment and after seeing what people said I should have used &quot;shouldn&#39;t be offended&quot; instead of &quot;can&#39;t be offended&quot;.  And again that&#39;s my opinion/view.  But anyone can be offended about anything, that&#39;s their right.  Whether any change comes of it once that opinion if brought up is another story.</p>\n\n<p>I still think it would be out of place for me to have a stance that I would tell someone of a different race/gender what they can/can&#39;t say about that particular race/gender that I&#39;ve never been associated with or been a part of.  Especially when that statement is not intentionally derogatory, or mean spirited, more of &quot;yup, that doesn&#39;t surprise me, based on my personal experiences of being part of that group&quot;.  I wouldn&#39;t tell a black person what it means to other black people when certain things are said, like I wouldn&#39;t tell someone that identifies as a woman that they can/can&#39;t say things about other woman since I don&#39;t know how it feels to be in that particular group.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
