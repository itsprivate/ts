Well in simple terms, I&#39;ve don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a good reason to think humanity will die out...I know that we are amazing survivors and have reached incredible levels of success and security, especially in the last 200 years.</p>\n\n<p>Factors such as our initial rise from cave dwellers to today’s society…it is an incredible testament to what we achieved especially in the face of adversity…our bounce back from the plague to the renaissance is one example…in an era where other diseases and wars were rampant…much worse than today…then the massive almost world ending eruption in Indonesia 75,000 yrs ago (the Toba catastrophe) couldn’t wipe us out when we were at our infancy…Our most vulnerable and ignorant ancestors pulled through…Then there is our ability to preserve food, cultivate food, tame animals, harvest plants…our diet is incredibly diverse, our ability to live in almost any earth bound climate is also incredible.</p>\n\n<p>Now to the obstacles we may face…we could face famine due to overpopulation, but it seems obvious that this is an argument for short term population decline, not eradication…same for any pandemics…now back to the bubonic plague…this was by far the worst pandemic we’ve experienced and it gave rise to the renaissance due to more resources being available p/person afterwards... It also doesn’t take into account modern medicine that would make the plague very hard to top.</p>\n\n<p>Now climate change: Is climate change that bad that all of humanity would starve? How could this be? This I feel is where I&#39;m less knowledgeable...but in the event we had multiple crop failures the human population would simply decline until the point where the food available can sustain the present population…We see this cyclical pattern play out in nature all the time. I see no reason that we couldn&#39;t grow crops...it could just be that we grow them in different parts of the world to a lesser extent where it was historically too cold etc.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the issue of time…this wouldn’t be a fast occurrence…it might start with some crop failures, then increased prices for staples and knowing how people are…once the developed world needs to sacrifice luxuries to afford bread and butter you can bet your last dollar shit will get done to mitigate the issue…I cannot see it reaching the point of worldwide starvation.</p>\n\n<p>Will we blow ourselves up in war? Hard to say for sure…I can definitely see a catastrophe of some sort occurring, I can see nuclear disaster wiping out most of us but I still find it unlikely (think of the steps it would take for that happen and then consider how likely each step is on its own and then combine the probability of all of those things happening) …Now if it did happen then I think the American paranoia during the cold war has taught us that people fucking prepare for that shit. Hideouts, bunkers, years’ worth of tinned food etc…We could at our own hands cause a dystopia, but it wouldn’t last forever…. We’d surely bounce back like we always have.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, a celestial event / Meteor…IMO the only plausible way to destroy our species (if it’s big enough) …These extinction events have wiped out the majority of life a few times every 100 million years or so, but life continued anyway…The idea that we are less equipped than dinosaurs is honestly bizarre (to me).</p>\n\n<p>Even If I maintain the belief that we will last longer than 1000years, hopefully someone can CMV so that I don&#39;t think the &#39;Doomer&#39; mindset is simply hysteria as it is a very pervasive belief.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
