Now, it might have something to do with me and whom I choose to surround myself around, but it feels like more people are beginning to throw the &quot;have you considered therapy&quot; line as a way of shutting others up. They don&#39;t really want to hear about that person&#39;s feelings or what they&#39;re going through and exert the emotional energy that sometimes comes with working through it with others, so one of the immediate responses is to try and throw money and a professional at it. Kind of like what some middle class and rich families do if and when their kids start acting up at school or in the family.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is a time and a place for therapy, heck, maybe we ALL unknowingly or knowingly need therapists of our own to speak with and work on a plan of action from time to time. But it should supplement what we already have with our social and familial bonds, not supplant it. A therapist is many things, but they are usually not your friend or confidant, and it&#39;s not really realistic of us to expect that of them either.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just saying this because some of the same people who will tell me to get therapy often don&#39;t have the time of day to answer a phone call from me and chat. We still need to talk and open up to each other before all of that stuff.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
