They&#39;re receiving levels of education even scholars didn&#39;t have 100 years ago and yet here they are whining about everything without actually knowing anything. They spout whatever they see online thinking its the trendy thing to do, have almost certainly never travelled to or lived in a developing country, and most of them were born on third base believing they hit a ringing triple.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m aging myself here but I taught English in Mainland China back in 1990 and wow was it ever an eye-opener. In no way am I an uber-wealthy individual but working abroad gave me a completely new perspective on how great life actually is here in the USA. Mainland China in 1990 was an extremely tough time for its citizens as 60% of their population was under the global poverty line, food was scarce, education/mobility was limited, buildings were crumbling, air was beyond polluted, and everyone commuted using worn-down bicycles because cars and mass transit systems that have been available to the masses in the first-world for several decades were still rare luxuries....guarantee these folks have never had to live in such conditions and some probably can&#39;t fathom that it exists.</p>\n\n<p>Yes America has its problems just like every place does (no where is perfect after all) but man these people take this way too far and really, the ones who say stuff like this are usually in an incredibly privileged position in comparison to 99.999% of humans who have stepped foot on Earth over the course of humanity and need to look themselves in the mirror for a second</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
