The vaccines have been proven effective with no long-term side effects, and have been made freely available along with incentives and a massive PR initiative. IE: Covid is an inescapable, but preventable illness at this point. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus, we should accept the bodily autonomy of the willingly unvaccinated, and allow them to be infected and/or die of coronavirus.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I would even go so far as to say we should allow insurance companies to deny them medical coverage. If they want to take their chances with the virus, that&#39;s their right, and we should let them.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if we allowed this population to become infected, that population would build some natural biological immunity to current and future covid variants. It would be better to build that immunity now, while the vaccines are still effective, than hold out trying to prevent transmission until a new variant emerges that the vaccines do not work against. The Devil we know (Delta primarily) is better than the Devil we Don&#39;t know. </p>\n\n<p>Please, CMV redditors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
