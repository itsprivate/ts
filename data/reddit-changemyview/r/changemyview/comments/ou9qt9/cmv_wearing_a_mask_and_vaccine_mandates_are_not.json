How can requiring wearing a mask and getting a vaccine a form of government control? What does the US government possibly gain by giving away free vaccines and requiring people to wear masks to stop the spread of the virus?</p>\n\n<p>If anything, the government should be worried about masks, as it interferes with face recognition technology and makes catching criminals harder. </p>\n\n<p>Why would mask mandates be all about controlling the American public when it’s actually counter protective to catching criminals?</p>\n\n<p>As for vaccines, why would giving away vaccines be a form of government control? The government gains nothing and instead giving something away for free is actually a financial loss on those distributing the vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>How does free mRNA technology in your body possibly do to you that you’re now suddenly susceptible to government control?</p>\n\n<p>I find it weird that people who are anti mask and anti vaxx say this is government control and yet, they are still allowed to criticize vaccine and mask mandates and half the country’s politicians and citizens agree. That doesn’t sound like government control.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
