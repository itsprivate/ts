I think part of this has to do with Covid-related eviction stays and a concern about what people are doing as these stays expire. However, people talk about landlords -- even just mom-and-pop type landlords who are renting a floor in their own house -- as if they are evil and greedy. It seems to me that small-scale landlords are just people who are stuck in the same capitalist system as all of us, and it makes sense to me that they are relying on their renters to get by to meet their own needs (e.g., paying off the mortgage).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are slumlord types who run huge buildings in cities and let them fall into disrepair while they price gauge their tenants, and that is very different -- that&#39;s not who I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m talking about small-scale landlords who are generally responsible and doing their best. For example, my management company is very small (they manage maybe one to two dozen properties) and responsive. Of course I wish my rent wasn&#39;t going up, but I also know it&#39;s going up everywhere in my area, so I see how my management company is sort of in a bind. They can&#39;t just keep my rent artificially low and still sustain their jobs.</p>\n\n<p>My feeling is that in criticizing landlords, people are failing to blame the true problem, which is the larger system of capitalism in the US. If you complain about landlords, you&#39;re sort of misdirecting people from realizing what the broader issues are. Why do we say that landlords are evil, but we fail to ask ourselves how is it that the government is allowing for insane monopolies over basic infrastructure/utilities? For example, in my area it&#39;s $80 for fairly unreliable 100mbps internet service. Why do we accept that it&#39;s okay for wildly wealthy companies to make a profit off basic medical/hygiene necessities like insulin and tampons? Why didn&#39;t we penalize financial institutions for the housing bubble that threw our country into a major recession? Our outrage, time, and energy would be better spent trying to address these broader issues that ultimately underlie the issue of expensive rent.</p>\n\n<p>edit: word was missing</p>\n\n<p>Clarification: I&#39;m not against capitalism, inherently! It&#39;s the current system of capitalism as it is playing out in the US currently that I&#39;m concerned about. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
