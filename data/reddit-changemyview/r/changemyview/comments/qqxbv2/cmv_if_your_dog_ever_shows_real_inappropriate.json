I&#39;ve also found that taking a dog park is a big decision for dog owners because of the presence of dogs that get triggered into violence. IMO, these dogs that have the capacity to be inappropriately violent should not be there.</p>\n\n<p>Most dogs have the capacity for violence if, for example, they or their owners are being truly attacked. I am not talking about that. By &quot;real, inappropriate aggression,&quot; I mean that the dog has the capacity to get triggered into dangerous aggressive biting at the dog park when it is not warranted.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, my dog has encountered a couple dogs at the park who were triggered into violence and the dog had to be physically separated from mine (who had not reciprocated in violence and instead immediately showed submission). One dog left a scar on his face. It happened once because a dog was being possessive of his water. Another time it was because a dog was &quot;protecting his sibling&quot; when my dog was playing with them. In both cases, the owners were aware that the dog could be triggered - they had obviously encountered the behavior before.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, I have known of other dogs getting more severely injured over the past year.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not the dogs fault. In some cases, these dogs may easily interpret normal behavior as a threat and respond violently because they think they are protecting themselves. But these dogs should not be off-leash at the dog park.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s true that a dog may show this type of aggression for the first time ever at the dog park, but that is rare. Unfortunately, the aggressive dogs I&#39;ve encountered have owners that are aware that the dog can be triggered but decides that the risk to the other dogs is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr Off-leash dog parks are not for all dogs. Many people take dogs to the off-leash dog park when they know that the dog has some violent tendencies, even if they only rare come out. These people are putting other dogs at risk and should not be coming to the dog park.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
