This was so critical for me growing up as a minority in a racist southern state, if I didn&#39;t learn early on not to let other peoples words affect me then I would&#39;ve fallen into deep clinical depression. But instead, I learned to block out other peoples hatred (particularly strangers) as I realized that no matter what I do or say, these people will never like me due to the color of my skin. I accepted the reality of my situation and moved on to focusing on maximizing my life and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>But nowadays there are huge pushes from largely white groups to change the language strangers use around them. From using proper pro-nouns to removing all forms of microaggressions, there seems to be a concerted effort to get everyone to change the way they speak. Growing up how I did, this is an effectively impossible battle to win IMO as people will not change their language if they do not like you (for whatever reason that may be: skin color, gender, age, weight, etc etc). A much more effective strategy for a happy life is to build up your inner strength to ignore people that don&#39;t like you, otherwise you&#39;ll constantly frustrated that the world will not change in their favor.  </p>\n\n<p>Why have we moved away from building up inner strength and instead resigned ourselves to focus our attention towards changing <em>other</em> peoples behavior? Personally I think its very dangerous because its not a strategy I believe in and will ultimately give people false hope and inevitably get heartbroken/depressed by the lack of changes in their lives.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
