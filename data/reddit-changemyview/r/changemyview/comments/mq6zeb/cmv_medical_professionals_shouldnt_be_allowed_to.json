Then, she wants to go on a vacation to Hawaii right after she’s done visiting! It’s insane to me that a medical professional of any kind can be allowed to behave this way and put this many people at risk. Who knows who she’s gonna spread it to while on the plane or when she goes to Hawaii or when she comes back. People might hate me for this, but a law should be put in place that anyone who refuses vaccines can’t be in the medical field. It’s unsafe and it just doesn’t make any sense... any other views out there?",
