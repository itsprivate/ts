  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I find it odd that the so-called &quot;pro-law enforcement&quot; crowd can&#39;t see how trespassing and ransacking the Capitol and violently trying to stop the certification of the nation&#39;s next President isn&#39;t something that should be met with dire consequences. These same people would say that a thief being shot and killed during an attempted home burglary would be justified, yet don&#39;t see how breaching through a glass barricade with members of Congress and the Vice President on the other end of that hallway shouldn&#39;t be an action that should be met with extreme force. I anticipate a lot of people will respond &quot;well who&#39;s saying that it isn&#39;t justified?&quot; Look no further than the former President himself who is attempting to martyr this woman as some kind of victim with his recent comments.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, perhaps there is something that I&#39;m not considering, so happy to have my mind or my premise changed. But after seeing extensive footage, not only was this lady being shot completely justified, I&#39;d argue that law enforcement went very light on the insurrectionists and if they had shot more of them it would still be completely justified.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT, Hello mods. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what it takes to change my view for me to award deltas. And my view is still open to change.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If someone can show me how her being shot was unjustifiable by showing me a factor that I have not considered.</li>\n<li>If they convince me whether she &quot;deserved&quot; to die. There&#39;s wiggle room here if you can argue that her actions aren&#39;t entirely culpable and other people or forces contributed more to her demise.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But if people make unfair / defensive arguments without getting to the heart of the issue, or if they&#39;re arguing semantically, I should be allowed to clarify my position. Just because these arguments did not convince me, it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not open to conversation and being convinced otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
