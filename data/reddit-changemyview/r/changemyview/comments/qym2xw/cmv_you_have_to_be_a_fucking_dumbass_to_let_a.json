Not everyone is fast. There are fat people that can&#39;t run as fast as skinny people and children can&#39;t run as fast as adults. Elderly people can&#39;t run as fast as the young. But walking zombies? Almost everyone can powerwalk. I&#39;ve seen elderly neighbors of mine powerwalking in the early mornings for exercise. That&#39;s fast enough to avoid walking zombies. So if you die because you can&#39;t be quiet or avoid a group of walking zombies, you&#39;re a dumbass.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
