Therefore, the government should take necessary steps to reduce consumption without outright banning it, because that didn’t work. A major component of this strategy is preventing advertising of alcohol. Let’s be honest, alcohol is a recreational drug, and it kills over 100,000 people each year, so why is it ok to advertise? What makes it different from cigarettes? </p>\n\n<p>People might say, “banning alcohol commercials won’t do anything.” I don’t agree. It’ll be a slow process, but this will prevent alcohol companies from controlling the way people think about alcohol consumption. And over time drinking will become less ingrained in society and less cool.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
