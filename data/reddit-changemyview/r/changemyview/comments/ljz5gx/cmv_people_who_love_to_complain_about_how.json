My issue is, if you’re going to bitch about the commercialization of Valentine’s Day, keep that same energy for every other holiday that has been as well. Cinco de Mayo in the USA has become about drinking and has been renamed “Cinco de Drinko” when the holiday has literally nothing to do with drinking. The same thing can be said about St. Patrick’s Day. Pre-2020, big companies and restaurants, switched the meaning of both days to incentive the public to spend exorbitant amounts of money on alcohol. Mother’s and Father’s Day is basically Valentine’s Day except the former two are more centered on children showing love for their parents. But to input the sentiments people have towards Valentine’s Day,  you should honor and love your parents everyday and not just on that one day! People never call out how \nMother’s Day, especially, is a Hallmark holiday but people will bitch out Valentine’s Day. And don’t even get me started on Christmas!! A capitalists dream day!! I honestly feel like it’s just bitter single people or people in unhappy relationships who want to hate on Valentine’s Day. I don’t have a valentine this year but I still can appreciate the day and i just love love and it makes me happy when I see people highlighting those that they love, even if it isn’t their romantic partner. I just roll my eyes when I see the same people complaining about Valentine’s Day then posting pictures of their Halloween outfits before they go out clubbing for the night (again, pre-2020). Sure people can like Halloween because of the creativity it brings in people who make costumes but Valentine’s Day allows people to be creative in how they celebrate it. Valentine’s Day is no more commercial than any other holiday so why does it get bitched out the most? I also feel like the more recently popularized Galentines Day/Singles Awareness Day have been generally well received in lieu of Valentine’s Day, which is no problem for me (hey, love on your friends and community and love on your single self!) people have no problem treating single Valentine’s Day as a “treat yourself” capitalist day while Valentine’s Day centered on coupledom still gets bitched on...so basically proving my point it’s just cause people who can’t be happy about other people being in happy, healthy relationships and so they use “it’s just so commercialized and i hate capitalism!” as their cover for not being happy for people.\n\nAnyways, Happy Valentine’s Day everyone! I hope you’re having an amazing day in spite of your marital status! I hope your day is filled with so much (self, platonic, familial, and romantic) love! \n💖✨♥️",
