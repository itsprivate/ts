  "selftext": "I strongly support transgender and nonbinary rights. I've debated with [TERFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF) and transphobes too many times in defense of trans/nonbinary rights. However, I have a stuck point: I believe *sex* is binary. **Please note**: I'm well aware of the existence of various intersex conditions and other nuances (**please see Context below**. It will NOT be helpful to give me a lecture on intersex variations), but the existence of some counterexamples do not necessarily invalidate a system of classification. \"Sex is binary\" is different than the proposition \"All swans are white\", which the existence of a single black swan would disprove. An analogy to binary sex which I find particularly difficult to argue against (probably because I believe it myself) is that humans are bipedal, and the existence of people who can't walk with 2 legs (or don't have 2 legs) doesn't negate the fact that humans are bipedal.\n\nPlease CMV! For example, if you think the bipedal analogy is a weak analogy, please tell me why.\n\n**Context:**\n\nI'm a neuropsychologist and I know that *sex* and *gender* are not the same thing, and *gender* is not binary. I know that [\"biological sex\" comprises various factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans) including the gametic type, chromosomal sex, gonads, sex hormones, genitals, etc. I know that the process of sex determination is complex (e.g., regarding the presence/absence of the SRY gene, androgen receptors sensitivity, etc.) and that deviation from the normative process can lead to [a wide variety of intersex conditions](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/). I've read many scientific co-ed articles arguing for sex being nonbinary, such as [this one on Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943) (although [the author later claimed that she meant there are two sexes](https://twitter.com/claireainsworth/status/888365994577735680?lang=en)). I know what a binary system is: 2 options ONLY (for example, 0 and 1 in a binary math system or computer science; there's no 3rd number). I also know the difference between *binary* and *bimodal*.\n\nHowever, I think **there's a difference between the** ***definition of sex*** **and** ***sex characteristics***. The distribution of *sex characteristics* is bimodal rather than binary, but the most [parsimonious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) **definition or classification for** ***sex*** **per se is based on gametes**: egg/large gamete = female, sperm/small gamete = male, which is binary. This is true not only for humans but across organisms that use anisogamy for reproduction. There's no 3rd gametic type.\n\nA counterargument here is that baby boys don't produce sperms, women after menopause don't produce eggs, etc. but they are still male/female. This counterargument isn't very good because the gametic-entailed definition/classification of sex isn't contingent on whether the organism is currently capable of producing sperms vs eggs, but rather whether the organism's reproductive system is organized around the purpose of producing sperms vs eggs.\n\nOf course, gametes don't matter in 99% of social situations where one's sex or gender is relevant. For example, one of the most contentious ongoing issues is whether trans women or intersex women qualify to play in women's sports, and yet [gametes have never been a determinant in the history of sex verification in sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports). However, the argument of utility/practicality is a different argument than the original definition/classification of sex itself.",
