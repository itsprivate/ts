Another main character starts doing chest compressions right away, and suddenly the person is coughing up water. They&#39;re OK. Hurray!</p>\n\n<p>Of course, that&#39;s not how it works. The person administering CPR didn&#39;t even check to see if they had a pulse. Didn&#39;t even check to see if they&#39;re breathing. Didn&#39;t check to see that the airway is clear (apparently it wasn&#39;t because the person coughed up a bunch of water).</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a movie where the CPR was actually administered properly.</p>\n\n<p>While some might argue that such actions would take us out of the drama, I disagree. Doing proper CPR is already very exciting and adding this kind of verisimilitude makes movies better, especially dramas with pretensions towards realism.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, knowing how to properly do CPR is an important skill. Seeing it modeled properly in movies and TVs would actually be beneficial to society as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I should have been clearer in the post. I&#39;m not saying that &quot;accuracy&quot; would require the scene to take 30 minutes, including a ride the hospital, or that that protagonist dies (because CPR doesn&#39;t have a huge success rate). I&#39;m not asking for so much verisimilitude that it usurps genre conventions.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m asking for the scene to depict the correct steps. Checking for pulse and breathing, positioning the head correctly, clearing the airway, doing chest compressions alongside rescue breathing. The basics.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d even be fine if these steps were done more quickly than they would be done by an EMT. There&#39;s a compromise that can be made here.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe doing this would take significantly more time to depict than what they currently do, and if there are added seconds, it&#39;s worth it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Delta award to <a href=\"/u/TaliaLackey\">u/TaliaLackey</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a good reason to not to depict CPR correctly in a historical movie. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
