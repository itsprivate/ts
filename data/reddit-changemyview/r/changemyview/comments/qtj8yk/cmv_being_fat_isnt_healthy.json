That people shouldn&#39;t diet, and so on...</p>\n\n<p>Look, I&#39;m not here to say there is no problem here. People are absolutely pressured into fitting expectations, and that pressure leads to terrible things like anorexia. It also creates fatphobia, which does exist. As a former fat person, I can say that for sure.</p>\n\n<p>However, not everything you are pressured into doing is a bad thing. You don&#39;t have to be super skinny or have a lot of muscle, for sure, but being over 400 pounds is just too much. People like these are killing themselves slowly. They spend their days unable to do many things, barely breathing, and often die at 40 or 50 yo.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to see an actual argument from HAES, because until now Ir frankly have only seen pseudoscience and appeal to emotion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
