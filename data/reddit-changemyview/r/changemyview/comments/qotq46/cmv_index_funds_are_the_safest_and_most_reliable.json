I did take a special interest in index funds for their general stability and ability to weather out the ups and downs of the market over the course of decades and I want to take the slow and steady route to ensure I have a happy ending.</p>\n\n<p>But is this <em>too slow?</em> If I invested $10,000 a year in index funds, how many decades do I have to wait to get $1 million? </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if I invested $10,000 in TSLA next year, how can I be sure that part of my portfolio will be safe over the years? I&#39;m not even talking decades here because anything could happen. </p>\n\n<p>But if things like war, unfavorable legislation, bubble bursting, a brilliant CEO dies and a shitty CEO replaced him or some unexpected event were to occur, would something like an index fund shield me better than other types of stocks?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
