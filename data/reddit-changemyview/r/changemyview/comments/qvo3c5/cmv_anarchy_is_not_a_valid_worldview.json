I become annoyed by this assertion because while I criticize the imperfect nature of laws and governments, I think that the alternative would be very brutal and violent. The pervasive thought I keep having is that he is very privileged and comfortable enough to have such views due to the very societal structures that he condemns. I welcome any perspectives on this that will help me be more thoughtful and understanding about this worldview rather than annoyed with it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
