Should we tip the customer service workers in grocery stores for bagging our milk? Should anyone other than an employer be paying the worker? \n\nI have worked in fast food and clothing retail and never once expected to get paid by the customer FOR DOING MY JOB THAT I CHOSE.\n\nNow back to the low pay, in Canada they used to pay servers $2 less than minimum wage, now they are paying them the same as minimum wage, yet tipping is still expected. There is no reason for tipping culture here since servers are being paid enough. \n\nIn the U.S. I have seen people say that your employer will make up what you don’t get in tips.
