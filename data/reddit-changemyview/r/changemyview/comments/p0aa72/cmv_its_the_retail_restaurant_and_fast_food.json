COVID was a problem, incentivizing people to stay home was the best way to control it, and nobody owes it to these industries to sit on their hands and just come back when given the go ahead. They had every right to improve themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the savings riders might have a <strong><em>legal</em></strong> obligation to come back, but morally, I say no. Fuck that. The law isn&#39;t the end all, be all. Slavery was openly legal at one point, so was murdering women for going against the church &quot;because of suspicions of witchcraft&quot;. These people have every moral right to collect their last two checks, and then ride on a wave of savings. And even if they get caught and arrested, they&#39;ll be in prison, not working for these companies. So the ones who don&#39;t get caught, and there will be some who don&#39;t, will still be able to refuse to go back. Leaving the people who <strong><em>did</em></strong> go back overworked, and likely to walk out without some major compensation boosts. </p>\n\n<p>A change is coming, and it&#39;s perfectly fine for that to be the case. And if it somehow doesn&#39;t, and you <strong><em>support</em></strong> that, you support not a representative democracy, but fascist totalitarianism. The people have made it clear they want better wage regulations. Politicians should be <strong><em>required</em></strong> to listen.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
