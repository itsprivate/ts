  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In Canada, if you are a nurse and openly promote antivaccination views, you can lose your license.  </p>\n\n<p>I think that should be the case in the US (and the world, ideally).  </p>\n\n<p>If you are antivax, I believe that shows an unacceptable level of ignorance, inability to critically think and disregard for the actual science of medical treatment, if you still want to be a physician or nurse (or NP or PA or RT etc.)  (And I believe this also should include mandatory compliance with all vaccines currently recommended by the medical science at the time.)</p>\n\n<p>Just by merit of having a license, you are in the position to be able to influence others, especially young families who are looking for an authority to tell them how to be good parents.  Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.  </p>\n\n<p>When I was a new mother I was &quot;vaccine hesitant&quot;.  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn&#39;t do hep B then I don&#39;t think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn&#39;t think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought &quot;natural immunity&quot; was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like <em>maybe</em> something wasn&#39;t perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.  </p>\n\n<p>Then I went back to school after I had my second. </p>\n\n<p>As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with <em>everything</em> they hadn&#39;t had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It&#39;s laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there&#39;s just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go? </p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was <em>very</em> unsure whether they&#39;d be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I&#39;m on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.  </p>\n\n<p>I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when <em>many</em> people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a <em>lot</em> of weight.  If you don&#39;t want to believe in medicine, that&#39;s fine, you don&#39;t get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we&#39;re at it, but antivax is a good place to start.  </p>\n\n<p>tldr:</p>\n\n<p>Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.  </p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t find holes in my logic, but I&#39;m biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn&#39;t  :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
