Even if a million people were on your side that’s still well under 1% of the US. Stay kind, keep learning, and be open minded, different viewpoints are what drive free countries forward. Don’t let a little support in a group convince you all your views are perfect and right. We all have places to change and learn.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
