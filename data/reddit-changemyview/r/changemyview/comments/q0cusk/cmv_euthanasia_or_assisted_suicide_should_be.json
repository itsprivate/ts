I simply think that people should be allowed the right to die on their own terms. Why should we force other people to continue their lives or make them seek unreliable methods of ending them? I also think we shouldn&#39;t have any restrictions on who is allowed to have this service. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re young, old , physically ill, mentally ill or simply don&#39;t feel like continuing your life, you should be able to end your life with dignity. We treat animals with this service when they are in critical condition but in most places we force humans to continue their lives in extreme suffering. Euthanasia and Assisted suicide would greatly reduce the suffering of people in their final moments as compared to keeping them in pain until they&#39;re death.</p>\n\n<p>Please change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
