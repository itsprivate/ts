However nowadays we have made many strives towards egalitarianism in the west, but far far from perfect. I think now we face a lot of road blocks from the women side just as much as the men refusing to change now. A good example is women telling men to &quot;man up&quot; or to take responsibility for all their short comings in life. While technically good advice, no one says this to a poor women or a homeless women struggling, they are offered sympathy. Additionally women on average will not date down in income, which is an issue when you consider men aren&#39;t attending college as much anymore. This reinforced patriarchy because it means the men with more money have greater control over everyone else.  I think women should be more aware of what they do to reinforce gender roles and act to fix them instead of just blaming men for all their problems.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
