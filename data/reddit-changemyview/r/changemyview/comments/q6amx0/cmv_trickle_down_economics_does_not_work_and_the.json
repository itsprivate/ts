Give major tax cuts to the big businesses, it will keep them in the US and it’ll eventually reach the little man. In my experience, that doesn’t happen. The wealth has been kept at the top with a major tax disproportion. Cost of goods have gone up. I’m not making more than I was a couple decades ago and it’s still considered a good paying job. I manage places, A/R, A/P, purchases. Last year with the bailout money, more people had disposable cash. Our business was taking in money that we weren’t used to and we were able to expand. Imagine if employees made a fair wage and less went to the top? If we all felt the same level of tax burden across the board? These businesses wouldn’t have to go overseas because people could afford to support them. For what it’s worth, I didn’t get any pandemic money. Worked the whole way through. I got to see how it was spent. Most locally, small businesses. Imagine if we could keep that trend up?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
