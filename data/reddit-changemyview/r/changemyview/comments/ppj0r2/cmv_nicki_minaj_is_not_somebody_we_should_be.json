In fact, she has had enough surgeries where nobody should be taking any medical content from her social media seriously at all. </p>\n\n<p>I recognize she is a personality, influencer, and artist. But why is nobody just slamming this stupidity? She HAS ZERO MEDICAL EXPERIENCE. </p>\n\n<p>The example I can give is she is a doctor in her field. As a rapper, she is an expert in her field. We would respect her opinions on that world. But would anyone respect Joe Biden’s opinions on hip hop? No, because he has no experience or understanding of that world. </p>\n\n<p>People change my view!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
