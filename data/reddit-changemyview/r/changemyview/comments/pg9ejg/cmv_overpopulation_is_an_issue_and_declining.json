  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have seen lots of people talk about how overpopulation is not an actual issue as the earth has enough space for lots more people and that we need to be remedying declining birthrates in the first world, and I very much disagree with both of these claims. First off, the claim that the earth has the capacity for more people.</p>\n\n<p>While technically the entire earth&#39;s population could fit into an area the size of Texas at moderate density, as people love to point out, this point completely ignores the fact that people like having space, national parks, etc, and pretty much all arguments about how many people the earth could technically house if it was all converted into all housing or food production are kind of useless because nobody wants to be living like that. This would take a massive reduction to our quality of life, and be pretty pointless. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/7-5-billion-and-counting-how-many-humans-can-the-earth-support-98797\">This</a> article suggests that the earth could only sustain about 1.5 billion people living at an American standard of living. Given that, it&#39;s obvious that the last thing we need is more Americans, but it&#39;s fine if people are born elsewhere, right? The issue is that as nations industrialize and people get wealthier they start to demand the American style of living, and so while growth rates in poorer countries may not be an issue to the carrying capacity of the earth, as they start to get richer and richer that population will still be there but will take an increasing toll on the earth, we see this in China already and will see it in India in coming decades, as in China more and more of their massive population has entered the middle class and we see exactly this happening.</p>\n\n<p>Given this, you can see why I think declining birthrates are a good thing, because even if the earth is supporting our current population of 7.5 billion, even with the same population in 20 years we will be needing a lot more land to support those 7.5 billion. People may propose the economic argument that constant growth is important, and while yes it&#39;s good in the short term, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for the long term survival of our species. For literally hundreds of thousands of years our species did just fine without constant growth, and yet it will only take a couple thousands years for us to jeopardize all of that with an obsession with expansion. And either way, even if the growth rate declines in the US, it&#39;s pretty high in many other parts of the world, and the US will have no problem importing high skilled labor from poor countries, so things will continue to be fine for the US, it&#39;s more of a problem for the third world countries that experience brain drain, so there&#39;s even less of a practical incentive for the US to try to incentivize their population to grow. So CMV, why is overpopulation not a problem and a declining birthrate a bad thing?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Since I&#39;ve gotten a lot of comments telling me that the carrying capacity of the earth is technically far higher than our current population or something similar: I KNOW, I ACKNOWLEDGED THIS, READ MY POST AND ENGAGE WITH MY POINTS, you&#39;re not going to change my view by saying things I acknowledged and disputed in my original post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
