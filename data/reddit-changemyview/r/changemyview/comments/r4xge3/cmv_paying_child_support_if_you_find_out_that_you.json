  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Some  time ago, a friend of mine found out through DNA test is not the father  of either his son and daugther. Both of them are relatively young.</p>\n\n<p>He  filed for divorce and obtained it, but since then he has to pay child  support which comes out as more than half his paycheck. Plus he has rent  and bills to pay. He challenged it in a court of law but ended up  losing the legal battle due to a number of circumstances. Long story  short, it was determined that he is the best candidate to provide the  kids a confortable upbringing and that he was not allowed to conduct a  DNA test on his child without the consent of the mother as well (and was  fined for that).</p>\n\n<p>He has made it clear that he does not want ties to his previous family and has changed city and job.</p>\n\n<p>I  find it unfair towards him and other people in his same situation. In  this case, the real father should step up and take responsibilities for  what he has done instead of being able to walk out free. Furthermore,  the mother should also be liable of some sort of fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Of  course, the wellness of the children matters. But this is way we pay  taxes. is it not? So that the state could support the less fortunate of  us and give them a fighting chance? Why should anyone be paying more to  contribute to the upbringing of children that are not his? What do they  have that is so special in respect to some other random orphan kid who  will do years in an temporary accomodation?</p>\n\n<p>Let  us allocate more of our budget towards creating a safety net for this  unlucky kids instead of torturing a poor guy to a life of 1€ meals,  shared accomodation and no savings.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT the reduction of his check is not just because of child support but also because he needed to pay all the expenses in his court case and also he has to pay his now ex wife monthly until she marries again. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
