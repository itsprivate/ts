Everyone hates taxes, everyone bitches about having to pay them but then they complain about the roads not being paved sufficiently, and not having enough infrastructure ect ect... My view on taxes is this: In order to live in a high functioning society we will have to pay taxes. Like when people want to throw a big barbecue or buy a bunch of alcohol for a party, oftentimes people pitch in money to pay for it all.

When someone steals something from someone they generally don&#39;t intend to give it back. This is not the case with taxes, it&#39;s a thing called tax returns.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
