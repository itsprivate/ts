Both dems and gop both either say:\n&quot;We should just eliminate single-family zoning to build giant condos&quot;\n   or...\n&quot;We should expand urban boundary lines and build more&quot;</p>\n\n<p>My point is, there are already enough homes in the country (assuming this as common knowledge). The problem is, no one can afford them, or they never get back on the market. You can <em>try</em> to legislate price/rent control but it&#39;s not going to work everywhere or last. Urban boundary lines likewise exist to protect any number of things, such as habitats, traffic, distribution, and general quality of life (not to mention climate change). And, as someone in a raging gentrification zone myself, I don&#39;t see the efficacy of building condos that working-class people can&#39;t afford, driving up prices even more, and pricing families out of their homes. There are a lot of ways to label housing as &quot;low-income&quot; but really not have it be affordable.</p>\n\n<p>The general point is, tons of companies have hoovered up mass quantities of homes (of all kinds and sizes) and will never, ever turn around and say &quot;Hey, family of 3 who needs a starter, let me sell you this at a fair price.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Using market forces, force a sell-off and re-circulate the homes that are being hoarded.</p>\n\n<p>Open to any and all discussion, thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
