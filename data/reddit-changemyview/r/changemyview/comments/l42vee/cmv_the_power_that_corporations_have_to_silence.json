But let me start off by saying I don't support Trump, and I don't support hate speech at all. I'm not entirely clear of the full situation, but as I understand it most users on Parler were promoting hate speech and illegal activities while the moderation did not attempt to stop it.\n\nTrump has been banned from Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, etc. He has basically no online presence whatsoever anymore. A number of huge tech giants teamed up to ban him from all of their platforms. To a lot of people, it's a good thing because of his numerous provoking tweets. I'm not aware of if he did the same on other platforms before being banned, so if he did please correct me. The problem is, a select few corporations together can basically prevent anyone from having any public social media presence if they reveal themselves. If, say, a civilian advocated strongly for things directly against those corporations and started to gain a bit of a following, enough to be deemed a threat, it is strikingly easy for those corporations to completely silence said person without even having to resort to more extreme measures.\n\nI acknowledge that this is similar to the past, in which if cable companies didn't like you, it was hard to have a widespread voice. But that doesn't make it any less of an issue, it was scary then and it's scary now. Except now, the internet is even more intertwined in our society and things have changed enough to almost require an internet presence. I'm aware that corporations could also just (if you want to get into a conspiracy) hire an assassin or something, which I really don't think actually happens.\n\nFor now, these tech giants silencing Trump and Parler is seen as a good thing, because a massive amount of people hate them, and because Trump incited some provocative thing. But just looking at the precedent this sets for the future, I think that's scary. I could bring this to a larger scope, that corporations have too much power in our society in general, but that's not fully the topic of this post.\n\nPlease change my view if you want.",
