But I do think it applies to many.</p>\n\n<p>I think many of the people you see who support concepts such as &quot;no human is illegal&quot; and &quot;no borders&quot; are hypocrites, and only believe this for countries for which the majority of the indigenous  population is caucasian. Suppose a conservative says &quot;I don&#39;t like mass immigration/migration because I want to preserve my culture&quot;, many would call him racist...but imo, those people are hypocrites because they actually agree with that conservative, as soon as you start talking about Thailand or Ethiopia. The indigenous populations of Thailand/Ethiopia are obviously not caucasian. So I&#39;d be willing to bet a lot of people who called the conservative above a racist would do a 180 and suddenly agree with a Thai person saying they &quot;want to preserve their culture.&quot; They would say &quot;Thailand is an ancient culture, with rich culture and history. It&#39;s not for a white person to move in and appropriate, especially if they don&#39;t speak thai.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe someone if they don&#39;t tell me the above paragraph makes sense when they think about it. <em>I</em> used to think that way, until I realized the double standard.</p>\n\n<p>And some people will &quot;white ness isn&#39;t even a thing and is just a social construct. Irish immigrants weren&#39;t even considered white in the 19th century!&quot; But this is nonsense to me. Firstly, it&#39;s not the 19th century today anymore. Everybody knows what a white person is and what it means to be a &quot;white person.&quot; The phrase &quot;people of color&quot; is meaningless if there&#39;s no such thing as white people. The same people who make arguments like that seem perfectly capable of identifying a white person to call them racist or remind them of their privilege. So &quot;whiteness is just a social construct&quot; is a meaningless phrase to me.</p>\n\n<p>Some side notes:</p>\n\n<p>This does not apply to countries such as the U.S or Canada, because even though the majority of <em>natives</em> are white today, the <em>indigenous</em> population are obviously not, being Native Americans/First Peoples. What I mean by the difference is this; being &quot;native&quot; to a country simply means you were born there and grew up there. It is where you are &quot;from.&quot; Being <em>indigenous</em> means if you took a map of the world and pointed to a location, you would be able to guess what ethnicity people would look like 700 years ago. So a white South Africa is native to South Africa if they were born and raised there, but not indigenous. A person of Japanese descent who was born and raised in NYC is native to America, not Japan. (Also note that I do not mean to confuse being native to America as being &quot;Native American.&quot; In our culture &quot;Native American&quot; has become a colloquy for &quot;Indigenous American&quot; and mean the same thing.)</p>\n\n<p>I also think the Hispanic/Latino ethic category in the US is an interesting one, because it&#39;s really an umbrella term for multiple completely distinct races. If you went to Mexico 700 years ago, everybody would have looked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples\">Mayan</a>. The modern day &quot;latino&quot; look most Americans would picture is a result of mixed Spanish-Mayan heritage 400 years ago, and is essentially a &quot;new&quot; ethnicity. Is 400 years old enough to count as indigenous? I&#39;m not sure.</p>\n\n<p>Also note what my title actually says- I&#39;m neither opposing nor defending multi-culturalism/immigration in this post, I&#39;m simply pointing out a double standard in how many people think of it. So an answer explaining the benefits of multi-culturalism wouldn&#39;t be changing my view, unless it&#39;s specifically about why it&#39;s good in some locations on the globe, but bad in others. And the Vatican City or North Sentinel Island don&#39;t count, because, well, come on.</p>\n\n<p>The TL;DR is that I think many people who support mult-culturalism have a double standard. They support a more conservative mentality of &quot;preserving one&#39;s culture&quot; if talking about a country they would perceive as &quot;ethnic&quot; (aka non-white), but support unlimited diversity and multi-culturalism for countries they perceive as &quot;white countries&quot; (aka Europe).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
