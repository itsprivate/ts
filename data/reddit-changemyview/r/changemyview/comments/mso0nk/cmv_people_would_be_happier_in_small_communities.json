With an expectation that in a few years we will sell a house and move on.\n\nThis is particularly pronounced in cities like London. Where we flock there (post University) for jobs. Move house and area every few years. And in many ways erode the local communities that were there by gentrifying the area.\n\nWe have almost a whole generation (25-40) who have been forced to move away from their home towns in search of jobs. And have spent the vast majority of their lives disconnected from a sense of local responsibility.\n\nThe end result is you find more and more people lonely and estranged from their old school friends. You have an apathy or nihilism about the area you live (as you assume you'll be leaving it soon). A lack of sense of responsibility to fix local problems or improve an area.\n\nI think the nostalgia that sits behind political movements like MAGA and Brexit (neither of which I would have voted for) come from that generation wanting to return to these smaller communities. \n\nThere's also a sustainability angle that seems to resonate here. Where small towns can have circular economies. Local entertainment. Local businesses sourcing local resources. Local community outreach and charities. \n\nJust to clarify: I'm not taking this to the extreme of small isolated villages and no cities. Trade and movement are of course important. And there will still be large companies like supplying things more efficiently. Im more hoping that the pandemic might start a trend of people moving away from bloated expensive cities. And rebuilding their own local communities.\n\nCMV.\n\nEdit: I think I should make clear that this is not meant to be taken in the most extreme sense. So not forcing people to stay in communities. Or eradicating cities. Just helping deflate bloated cities and making sure people have the option to stay local, rather than feeling forced to move to cities (away from their friends and families) in order to find a job. There are many policies that can be put in place to protect local communities and encourage job growth, which would allow people this option.",
