As it stands right now, my family is expecting me to go to University in either England or Scotland once I finish my current course. I, at this point, have absolutely no fucking intention of going because it's too expensive.\n\nThis is where my point comes in. My parents have been raised on the idea that following Secondary School, you should immediately go for college and/or university, and if you don't, you'll be unmotivated or whatever. My oldest brother accepted this idea, my 2nd oldest brother accepted this idea, but me? Well you already know I didn't, read a few lines up.\n\nIf you don't go to university, you aren't guaranteed to lead a miserable life, if you go to university, especially nowadays you aren't guaranteed a successful life. If you want to university or college, go for it. If you don't, fair enough. If you want to take a year off like I did, fucking go ahead.
