No. That’s their right.</p>\n\n<p>Is it wrong for them to want to drive the biggest SUV/truck instead of a small, eco-friendly electric car (or better yet, riding a bicycle to work)? No. It is absolutely their right to act however they want, however selfishly they want to be.</p>\n\n<p>Thus people have no responsibility to earth. They can be as selfish as they want.
