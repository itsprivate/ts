Then why can’t we try and do the same for animals who are much more helpless and in need of support instead of putting them down simply because it might be too much work and money? </p>\n\n<p>I may not know all the specific details that go into this decision, so help me learn please?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
