You hug the person, maybe talk to them about your troubles and go on about your day.</p>\n\n<p>Except then they stop you and say “hey this is actually a social experiment. Can I use you in my YouTube video”? Or even worse days or months later someone shows you a viral video you’re in where you’re hugging someone and venting frustrations. </p>\n\n<p>Example: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gf2ao3_kyTk\">https://youtu.be/Gf2ao3_kyTk</a></p>\n\n<p>The comments are always this is so wholesome, we need more people like you, etc. But when we bring it to reality and consider this was all set up it becomes a lot less wholesome and a lot more deceptive.</p>\n\n<p>These people are coming up to a stranger putting themselves in a vulnerable position. For some of these people I’ve seen in videos it’s a major release. There’s an inherent sense of trust in that situation. That trust is then broken when you figure out there’s a creep in the trees shooting everything. Do we really believe this guy would be out there doing this if it weren’t for a camera?</p>\n\n<p>Videos like this do more damage than good because it makes caring about mental health a trend. In order to make it worth your while you have to take a picture or make a video so you can get your internet points. </p>\n\n<p>That’s not so wholesome or helpful if you ask me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
