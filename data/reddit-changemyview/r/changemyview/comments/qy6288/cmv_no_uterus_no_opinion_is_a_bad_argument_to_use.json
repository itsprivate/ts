If their opinion truly didn&#39;t matter, then pro-choice people wouldn&#39;t support male pro-choice allies.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention that this argument excludes infertile women and trans women.</p>\n\n<p>As women I believe we need male allies to win this fight. And &quot;no uterus, no opinion&quot; is purely divisive and exclusionary.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My argument is solely against this statement and NOT as an attack on the pro-choice movement as a whole. I&#39;m a pro-choice woman myself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
