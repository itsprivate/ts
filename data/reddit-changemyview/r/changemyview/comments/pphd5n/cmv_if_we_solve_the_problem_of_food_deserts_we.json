  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>One in nine people in the U.S. used SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as food stamps, the largest food assistance program for low-income Americans in the nation) — in 2019, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. SNAP benefits vary depending on the need of the participant, but the average SNAP benefit for each member of a household was $129 per month in fiscal year 2019. According to one estimate by researchers at Northwestern University, food insecurity more than doubled as a result of the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, hitting as many as 23% more households in 2020. In March 2020, when the Families First Act passed as part of the government&#39;s emergency response to the pandemic, the maximum benefit for SNAP recipients was temporarily expanded by an estimated 40%. An analysis from the New York Times shows that SNAP grew by 17% from February 2020 to May 2020, three times faster than in any previous three-month period. Yet even with expanded food aid, the program hasn&#39;t managed to meet the nation&#39;s food security needs.</p>\n\n<p>A big reason why the aid did not go as far as it could for those who needed it was the prevalence of food deserts. In low-income urban settings, you need to live more than a mile away from a supermarket to be considered inside a food desert. For rural areas, it&#39;s greater than 10 miles. About 19 million people, or roughly 6% of the population, lived in a food desert and 2.1 million households both lived in a food desert and lacked access to a vehicle in 2015, according to the USDA. Rural counties make up 87% of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity. </p>\n\n<p>This often forces families to shop at ‘mini-marts’ or gas stations for their routine groceries. These local businesses generally sell ‘junk’ food and have significantly higher prices for this food (which is rarely fresh). Milk prices, for example, are about 5% higher in some places, while prices for cereal are sometimes 25% higher.</p>\n\n<p>The government can throw all the money it wants at the problem in the form of food aid, but as long as quality affordable food is harder to obtain for low income communities, low-income families will never be able to thrive the same as those who have ready access to quality food. This specific issue is the linchpin around which many inequalities revolve. </p>\n\n<p>POSSIBLE WAYS WE CAN FIX THIS: Zoning changes to allow mobile healthy food vending as well as farmers’ markets in areas known to be food deserts. Improve public transportation to enhance access to full-service grocery stores. Legislate minimum distance laws and regulations for fast-food chains and convenience stores from schools and venues where children spend their time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
