If you’re white you’re a colored person too, just of a different pigmentation. Terms that separate white people form everyone else aren’t progressive at all, because there is a bias in that separation. What would you call someone who is not Asian? You’d say they weren’t Asian. If someone wasn’t white you would call them a person of color. White people aren’t any less colored than Asian people, it’s just a different color.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
