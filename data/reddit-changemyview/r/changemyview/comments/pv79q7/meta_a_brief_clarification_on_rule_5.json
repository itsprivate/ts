The aim is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Most comments that are removed fall under one of a few categories:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contradictions - just saying &quot;you are wrong&quot; without any expansion on why they are wrong doesn&#39;t help further anyone&#39;s understanding.<br/></li>\n<li>Jokes - humour is permitted, but a joke doesn&#39;t in of itself warrant a comment. It creates distracting, off-topic fluff that doesn&#39;t contribute to changing OP&#39;s view<br/></li>\n<li>Non-sequiturs - wildly off-topic comments that don&#39;t pertain to anything being discussed in any way.<br/></li>\n<li>Link dumps - unless it&#39;s extremely obvious from conversation context <em>exactly</em> what is contained within the link, you should explain why the link is relevant, and what the most important parts are if any<br/></li>\n<li>Simple affirmations of agreement - the upvote button exists. Adding a comment just to state that you agree without re-emphasising any specific points or making expansions again just adds noise and doesn&#39;t help change views<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And to be clear, the following does not constitute a violation of rule 5</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Politeness - for instance, thanking someone for giving you a delta<br/></li>\n<li>Humour contained within substantive comments - the wild examples CMV commenters come up with when arguing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum\">reductio ad absurdum</a> not only make me smile, but are also good persuasive devices. The more absurd the better when trying to illustrate why certain logic is faulty.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5\">the wiki</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any thoughts on how we moderate, <a href=\"/r/ideasforcmv\">r/ideasforcmv</a> is open as ever and will pretty much always receive a response from at least one mod. Alternately if you have feedback, feel free to express it civilly in this thread, we&#39;re always looking to improve how we run things. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, thank you as ever for making this place great.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
