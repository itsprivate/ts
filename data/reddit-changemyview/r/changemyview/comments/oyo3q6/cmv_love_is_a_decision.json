Well, I want to get away from emotional/chemical responses to stimuli as definition. Hugging my girl after sex certainly makes us feel good, but I&#39;m trying to establish a definition of love transcending body chemistry. </p>\n\n<p>Love is patient and love is kind, but only if you wake up and make the decision to be patient and kind. Love does not choose your actions for you, your actions are the proof of your love.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Potential arguments that will not change my view:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>any introduction of divine love to the discussion, I&#39;m talking about secular humans and language.</li>\n<li>etymological chain of definitions for love through history arguing I&#39;m wrong about what it means - interesting no doubt, but not super applicable to a personal definition of a modern word I think</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am open to changing my view if you can make an argument that love is an intrinsic emotion without me being able to point out a better word to describe that phenomena. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you can provide some relevant input from philosophers on the nature of love that modifies my view, delta for you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
