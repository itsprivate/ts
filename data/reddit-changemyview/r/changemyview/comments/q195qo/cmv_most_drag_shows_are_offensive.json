You don&#39;t see male drag performers dressed in a butch manner very often (if at all). You also don&#39;t see much drag where female performers dress as men and what does exist is hardly popular. </p>\n\n<p>This all leaves me with the uncomfortable feeling that drag performances reinforce negative stereotypes about women and project the idea that women who are interesting to society must look and act a particular way and women who don&#39;t look and act that way aren&#39;t really women on some level. </p>\n\n<p>This may just be some of my own personal insecurities coming through since in my personal life I&#39;ve been made to feel that I must dress in a feminine manner (e.g. my sister required me to wear a dress to be a bridesmaid in her wedding), but I really think drag performances are offensive.
