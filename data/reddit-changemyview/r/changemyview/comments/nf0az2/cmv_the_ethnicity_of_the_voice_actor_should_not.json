Her argument was that it made them more genuine to the characters.\n\nI argued that cultural understanding is more important than ethnicity. Or there may be situations where it won’t matter because the characters ethnicity doesn’t play a strong enough role in the context of the story that it could only be voiced by someone with an understanding of that cultural background. (A good example that comes to mind is Kuzco where him being a mesoAmerican emperor is just a setting, not an important part of the culture for the area)\n\nActors train them selves to get into the mindset of other people, it’s silly to think that race could be such a insurmountable barrier of understanding that no actor could voice a character that is a different culture. How could Nancy Cartwright voice Bart Simpson, to the best of my knowledge she has never been a 10-year-old boy?\n\nI am Jewish but don’t speak a word of Hebrew, am I more qualified to voice a character in ancient Israel then someone who isn’t Jewish but actually speaks Hebrew? Japan is a pretty homogenous country, and they have Japanese actors characters voicing characters from all around the world and even cultures that don’t actually exist. Do they need to outsource to find people that speak Japanese and are the same ethnicity of those characters. Is the narrator for an audiobook supposed to not voice one of the characters if it happens to be a different ethnicity, do they need a call a stand in to do the voice for that one character?\n\nIf they did a blind audition for a character, and found a voice that fit the character perfectly, should they double check to make sure the ethnicity fits too?\n\nI can understand having more diversity with the actors applying for roles, but I don’t think forbidding people from acting outside of their ethnicity fixes the problem, it swings too far in the opposite direction",
