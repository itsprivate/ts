This belief has been mounting for a while, but I&#39;ll admit that the impetus for this post is somewhat reactive. I just saw a NYT article summary that read, &quot;I Am Always Out of My Lane: The debate on reopening schools was toxic. Just ask Emily Oster, an economist who . . .&quot; I think this sucks, for numerous reasons. First, I don&#39;t like seeing journalistic language cheapen itself at the same pace as low-value Twitter discourse. But more importantly, to me, a term like &quot;toxic&quot; generally insinuates a lot about systemic and cultural malfeasance within an organization or group, but is just as often lazily used as a synonym for &quot;bad&quot; that allows people to draw <em>inferences</em> about bigotry, sexism, or some other systemic malfeasance without any offer of proof. In this headline, it&#39;s basically just meaningless and annoying to see.</p>\n\n<p>But we do see it all the time with more harmful consequences. &quot;The office culture there is toxic&quot; is a phrase someone might use when describing burnout, overtime, and other labor abuses in an industry. By using a term like &quot;toxic&quot; they allow listeners to think the worst of the worst about the culture--that it&#39;s prejudiced, that the leaders are unrepentant bigots, etc.--with plausible deniability, because no slanderous accusations about bigotry were <em>actually</em> made. This is dangerous, because we see more and more that people are ready and eager to out each other as nonspecifically &quot;problematic&quot; in the never-ending game of mutually assured reputational destruction over nothing but vague allegations.</p>\n\n<p>I think this phenomenon is something that needs to be recognized so we can begin the disarmament process, and not allow people to get away with implying the worst about others while putting very little on the line, in terms of their own future trustworthiness.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
