Isn’t it a little racist to generalize all of white people into one culture? Wouldn’t it seem a little off if I were to say that all African Americans share the same culture? \nLet’s take a white person who grew up in India his entire life, and a white person who grew up in the U.S.A. Don’t you think that despite their skin colour they would have grown up to be accustomed to completely different cultures? Culture is defined not by the colour of your skin but by the characteristics and knowledge of someone. \nIf by white culture people just mean white people in the U.S.A, that’s still illogical; there are many many non-white people living in America who follow the exact same culture. I invite you to change my mind or possibly educate me more on this topic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
