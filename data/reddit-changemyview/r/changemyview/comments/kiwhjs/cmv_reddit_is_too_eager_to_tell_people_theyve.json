  "selftext": "CW: rape\n\nI was reading another post on relationship advice last night. OP is unhappy in her marriage, she described how she wanted to stop having sex but her husband holds her down and keeps going.\n\nRight, that's rape, and OP needs to understand it's not okay at all so she can get out of that marriage. But the responses seemed a little extra: \"That's rape, you were raped, you're a rape victim and you gotta call it rape.\" It felt confrontational maybe? Certainly more blunt and forceful than I'd be with someone who just suffered sexual trauma. And there were dozens of these comments!\n\nI'm worried it doesn't come from an empathetic place, because it fits a pattern I've been seeing on reddit. Commenters get *angry* when an article about a sex offense uses any term like \"had sex with\" or even \"assaulted\". \"That's rape, it's wrong not to call it rape\", they say. Like they hate the perpetrator so much that using any other word feels like letting them off easy.\n\nI've even seen guys here tell stories like \"when I was 15 I hooked up with my friend's totally hot mom\" and the replies will say \"no that's rape, she raped you.\"\n\nI think that if someone has made it through being taken advantage of with relatively little psychological damage, then insisting they call themselves a rape victim could actually hurt them. I know that the victims in abusive relationships will tend to minimize their own suffering and the degree of wrongness involved, but they way to counteract that is to be gentle and help them realize on their own - not to hit them repeatedly with one of the ugliest words in the English language. I'm worried that that kind of bluntness could end up reinforcing walls instead of breaking them down.\n\nI'm not trying to talk out my ass here. I'm a survivor myself, but I was a little kid when it happened, so I don't remember all of the psychology around my own trauma response. If you survived assault or an abusive relationship as an adult, I'm especially interested to hear your perspective. Was bluntness what you needed, or did gentleness help you admit there was a problem? Are there other factors I'm not considering?\n\nThanks, this has bothered me for a while.",
