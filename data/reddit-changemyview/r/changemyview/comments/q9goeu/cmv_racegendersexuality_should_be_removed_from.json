White man breaks into house, steals car</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the answer is race and gender. You might say it’s just adding detail but we have to think about how we perceive these details consciously and subconsciously.</p>\n\n<p>How many times have times have you heard a story on the news about something happening and assumed the race of the person? If you guessed correctly then you’re reassured and if you guess incorrectly you might be surprised. Theres even an SNL skit poking fun at it: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NGqtZmShIkw\">https://youtu.be/NGqtZmShIkw</a></p>\n\n<p>Whether intentional or not, by adding these descriptions it reinforces predjudices. These descriptions don’t serve a real purpose but what it does is suggest that the reason this person did the crime was because of their race/gender/sexuality. Add to it that news stations choose to report certain details and certain stories I think they are aware of this</p>\n\n<p>So my view is, unless it serves a specific purpose to the viewers, certain descriptions shouldn’t be added to the news story</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
