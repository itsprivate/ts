  "selftext": "Volvo just pledged to switch all their cars to electric power by 2030.\n\nI am 100% a believer in electric cars. In general, they are more efficient and have better performance.\n\nHowever, batteries are a terrible energy storage method for vehicles. They don’t store enough energy, they can’t hold their energy for long enough, and they’re HEAVY. Whether the battery is charged or not, you have to haul it around. It’s extremely inefficient for anything except daily commuting when you can charge overnight. Add onto that the environmental and supply chain issues of battery production, and making all cars battery powered is an idiotic, band-aid solution.\n\nVehicles, especially commercial and utility vehicles, need to be able to refuel quickly and store that energy for long periods of time. The only currently available green technology that allows this is hydrogen.\n\nVolvo, and many other car manufacturers who have made all-electric pledges, seem to focus entirely on battery vehicles and charging infrastructure. Neither Volvo or GM seem to make any mention of hydrogen vehicles in their press releases.\n\nObviously, creating a hydrogen refueling infrastructure is a massive undertaking that a single company would not be able to accomplish. However, especially in Europe, they could easily work together and make it happen with the support of regulators.\n\nIf automakers and regulators actually cared about developing the future of personal transportation, they would be investing in hydrogen. Instead, they’re putting their money into batteries because it’s an easy and trendy way to get good PR.\n\nObviously, there is room for battery powered vehicles in the market, but they are not the be all, end all solution many people seem to think they are.\n\nTl;dr:\nHydrogen makes more sense than batteries for powering vehicles, automakers pledging to make all battery-powered vehicles are just trying to score PR points\n\nEdit:\nBattery powered vehicles are already proving to be more popular than fossil fuel vehicles for certain markets. Battery power makes perfect sense for short range commuter cars in an urban environment. My main point is that batteries do not make sense for many other applications (long range travel, shipping/trucking, off-road vehicles, etc.). If we truly want to eliminate all fossil fuel vehicles, I think hydrogen is the answer for these cases.\n\nEdit 2:\nOk, lots of great points in the comments! Obviously, if battery technology significantly improves, then that will solve many issues. For the immediate future, swappable batteries may allow commercial vehicles to operate pretty much normally. For the far edge cases like very remote areas and long term storage, we could potentially just use regular fossil fuel engines but use an offset technology such as carbon capture or biofuels to make it carbon neutral.\n\nNow how about ships? Could they run on hydrogen?",
