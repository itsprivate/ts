If a man removes a condom mid-sex without the knowledge (and/or approval) of his partner, that should be punished. If a woman lies about being on birth control and has sex with a man, she deserves to be punished. Same applies if she claims that she's already pregnant, when she isn't. If a woman has previously taken birth control pills and then decides to stop taking them, she should be legally obliged to tell her sexual partner(s) about it before having sex with them again, if she has previously told them that she's on birth control. Same applies for a man who decides to reverse his vasectomy.\n\nMy opinion applies even if they don't result in a pregnancy or an STD. Of course it has to be **proven** that there was deception, because pregnancies can still happen even with birth control. I don't want to see people punished for defying the odds.
