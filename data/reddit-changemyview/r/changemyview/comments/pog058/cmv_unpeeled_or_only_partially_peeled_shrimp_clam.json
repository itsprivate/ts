The last thing someone should have to do is perform surgery on their pasta. Yet, that is often exactly what is required of diners when a restaurant offers pasta with shrimp that have not been totally peeled, or with clams still in the shells. So many times, in order to enjoy all of the dish&#39;s ingredients, one is required to perform multiple sloppy mini-surgeries to extract the edible portion of the shrimp or clam; in many cases, there is no way to do this without involving your hands. It is totally uncivilized. If it does not involve direct handling with the fingers, at the very least it requires an irritating procedure that could have just as easily been performed in the kitchen before the plate came to the table. </p>\n\n<p>What do these shrimp tails, skins, legs, heads, or clam shells even add to the dish apart from headache? Some may argue these things add flavor. If that is what the chef is after, I respect that; leave those things in while preparing the sauce and remove them after they have imparted their flavors. Do whatever is necessary to maintain the integrity of the dish, but do not involve the customer. I have also heard people argue that whole or partially peeled shrimp or clam shells offer some kind of aesthetic value to a dish. This I find wholly unconvincing. Shrimp look like an insect a person would immediately kill if it appeared in their home, and clams are in no way aesthetically pleasing, either. Furthermore, while I do believe cooking is an art (and that there may be those who disagree with my opinion on the aesthetic value of shrimp and clams), in the end we must remember that the ultimate reason a dish has been created was for (presumably enjoyable) consumption. Bearing that in mind, any aesthetic value things like unpeeled shrimp or clams theoretically possess is far outweighed by the very real interference they introduce to the consumption of the meal. </p>\n\n<p>I also maintain that offering these dishes to the public is a transgression against the tacit agreement that exists between restaurant and diner. As the customer, I pay for the ability to order what I want from the menu, and for that dish to be brought to me fully prepared and ready for my consumption. There should be no intervening procedures required of me pertaining to the food (with the possible exception of sprinkling a little salt or pepper). However, when a pasta dish comes to my table and still requires me to perform multiples steps before I can eat it, this principle has been violated. In effect, the kitchen has passed their work on to me, which, in my view, constitutes a breech of contract. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that my comments do not apply to dishes like fajitas, etc. where the assembly is part of the customer&#39;s enjoyment, or to things like shrimp boils or crab where it is understood beforehand that peeling / cracking is the main mode of consumption. As an aside, I would also note that neither example necessitates the diner messily digging through sauces, etc. like a complete barbarian. </p>\n\n<p>As such, it is my contention that all things like shrimp tails, legs, heads, and skin, clam shells, or any other such inedible materials that interfere with a dish&#39;s consumption should be removed. </p>\n\n<p>I welcome any questions, or comments that may help me see this issue in a different light. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
