For example doing away with hiring quotas in the workplace and instead hiring based soley on their merit, as well as not flying into a craze every time a traditionally white character in a work of fiction is cast as a non-white actor (as long as race is not important to the plot) as well as not v\noting for a politician simply because you hare a superficial character trait such as race or sex with them (Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton etc) are just some examples of this. True racial and gender equality is marked by race and gender being a complete irrelevance and instead a person's merit being the only reasonable metric to judge them by.\n\nI get the counter argument, which typically goes something like \"If we all pretend to be colourblind we won't see racism when it happens\" and frankly I find this ridiculous. Firstly, not caring about race and sex doesn't literally mean that we pretend we can't see race and sex. Obviously we can, it just means we don't care about it. Second, we don't have to dichotomise not caring about race with refusing to acknowledge racism when it happens. We can do both. Third, there would literally be no racism at all if everyone was \"colourblind\". Obviously that will never happen, but the more people that support this idea the better, as it means we come closer to eliminating racism.\n\nRemember what Morgan Freeman said- \"How do we stop racism? Stop talking about it. I'm going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask that you stop calling me a black man.\"",
