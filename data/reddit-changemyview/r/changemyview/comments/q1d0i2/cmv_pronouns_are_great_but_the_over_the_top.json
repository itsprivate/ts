You cant sit there and expect someone to call you that, and get mad when they dont. Some people arent comfortable calling you a god, or a kitten, and its not transphobic for someone to not do that. Its not a big deal, and Ill respect them If I&#39;m comfortable with them. But this just does more harm to the community than anything. It makes those people who use alternative pronouns, look bad.   </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m even fine with neoprounons like xe/xem, but I cant bring myself to refer to you as &quot;God&#39; or &quot;Kitten&quot;, and I guess I feel that you can&#39;t tell me that&#39;s legitimately how you identify.   </p>\n\n<p>It seems like its making a mockery of actual nonbinary persons who use alternative pronouns, and just does more harm than anything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
