Also, for the record, I’m black so please don’t accuse me of being racist.</p>\n\n<p>For this argument, I will be comparing the number of police shootings to the number of arrests. The reason I’m doing it this way is that, the vast majority of the time at least, police don’t just take out their guns and shoot random people. These shootings occur in the process of an arrest. </p>\n\n<p>Here is data for the number of police shootings by race from 2017 to 2021:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/</a></p>\n\n<p>And here is data for the number of arrests by race from 1980 to 2019:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2&amp;selYrs=2019&amp;rdoGroups=1&amp;rdoData=c\">https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2&amp;selYrs=2019&amp;rdoGroups=1&amp;rdoData=c</a></p>\n\n<p>I will be taking the data from 2017 to 2019, because that is where these two sources overlap. From these two sources, the total number of arrests from 2017 to 2019 is 21,408,160 for white people, and 8,363,910 for black people. The total number of police shootings from 2017 to 2019 is 1226 for white people, and 667 for black people. </p>\n\n<p>Dividing the number of arrests by the number of shootings gives us that one in every 17,462 white people are killed during an arrest, and one in every 12,540 black people are killed during an arrest. Dividing these two numbers gives us that a black person is 1.39 times as likely as a white person to be killed by the police. </p>\n\n<p>This is definitely more, but nowhere near as much more as many people would lead you to believe. This misinformation is probably fueled by bold headlines such as:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Black people more than three times as likely as white people to be killed during a police encounter&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/blacks-whites-police-deaths-disparity/\">https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/blacks-whites-police-deaths-disparity/</a></p>\n\n<p>Arguments that will change my view:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Showing that I made a mistake in my calculations. </li>\n<li>Proving that the statistics I cited are not reliable sources</li>\n<li>Proving that comparing number of arrests to number of shootings is not an accurate method</li>\n<li>Showing other data comparing the number of arrests to the number of shootings which contradicts the data I have shown here</li>\n<li>Showing data that includes the “Unknown” part of the Statista data, and shows that this new data significantly changes the outcome of the calculations</li>\n<li>Showing new data that includes 2020 and 2021, and showing that this new data significantly changes the outcome of the calculations</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
