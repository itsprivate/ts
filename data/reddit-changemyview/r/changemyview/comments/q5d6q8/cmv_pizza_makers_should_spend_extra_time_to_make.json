  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>At first, this seems like a CMV with no opposing side. But considering how many pizzas that I&#39;ve eaten in my life and how many have unevenly spread out toppings, I believe this CMV is needed. I&#39;m talking about all the pizzas. Full pies from a pizza shop, frozen pizza, personal pies. Having an empty cold spot on a personal pie is almost as bad as one slice of eight having 2 pepperonis while another slice has 10. Yes, I know making food look nicer takes a little bit more time. I know some pizza makers use the &#39;toss a grenade in the air and hope it hits everything&#39; technique. The other side of it is a pharmaceutical pill where each individual manufactured pill still must have the exact amount of ingredients down to the microgram. I think there is a solution between these two extremes. I believe it takes only a couple extra seconds to move a few pepperonis into empty spaces of hand made pizzas. If I have to do it after I&#39;ve already bought it, then I potentially have to touch someone else&#39;s food.</p>\n\n<p>This post is for all the pizza makers who do not take a strong stance against topping inequality, CMV!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
