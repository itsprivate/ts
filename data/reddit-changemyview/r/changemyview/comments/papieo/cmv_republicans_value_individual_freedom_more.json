Republican attitudes towards these issues value individual gain and/or freedom at the expense of collective safety. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of guns, there is a preponderance of evidence showing that the more guns there are in circulation in a society, the more gun violence there is; there is no other factor (mental illness, violent video games, trauma, etc.) that is more predictive of gun violence than having more guns in circulation. Democrats are in favor of stricter gun laws because they care about the collective, while Republicans focus only on their individual right to own and shoot a gun. </p>\n\n<p>Re climate change, only from an individualist point of view could one believe that one has a right to pollute in the name of making money when species are going extinct and people on other continents are dying/starving/experiencing natural-disaster related damage from climate change. I am not interested in conspiracy theories or false claims that climate change isn&#39;t caused by humans; that debate was settled three decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>Re COVID-19, all Republican arguments against vaccines are based on the false notion that vaccinating oneself is solely for the benefit of the individual; it is not. We get vaccinated to protect those who cannot vaccinate/protect themselves. I am not interested in conspiracy theories here either, nor am I interested in arguments that focus on the US government; the vaccine has been rolled out and encouraged GLOBALLY, so this is not a national issue.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
