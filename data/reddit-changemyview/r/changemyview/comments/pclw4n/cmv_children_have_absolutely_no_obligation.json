I’m referring to all kinds of parents. Children aren’t obligated to take care of them in old age. \nEven if you  did a good job as a parent and treat your children well, your children aren’t obligated to take care of you. Parents decide to bring children into this world, they have no say in this, so if they choose to not take care of you when you are older, then you can’t blame them. </p>\n\n<p>I’m mostly trying to talk about toxic and abusive parents where they treat their children like shit and expect to be treated well in return. Fuck that. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why I even posted this CMV is because there are actually some people in the world who believe that “<em>you need to take care of parents regardless of how they treated you / brought you up</em>” and to me that is a BS fallacy.</p>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
