That means lots of background checks, living situation checks, making sure you have a stable income and safe living environment and have no problematic past that would make you a risk to the child. If you pass all this then you are free to adopt children and BABIES free of charge vs the 10s of thousands in the US for healthy babies.\n\nThis is 100% the way it should be, get those children into homes asap and stop messing around!\n\nNow for Foster care I should explain what I mean by count as a job. Aside from the stipend that you get to use for things the child needs, someone should be allowed to work part time (20 hours) and then get SNAP and other assistance if they are fostering.\n\nIf you OWN the house/condo then you shouldn't have to work at all and they should give you food and gas assistance because it's not that much money and you are helping children in need out.\n\n\nObviously this brings the issue of people who don't actually care for the children going into foster because they just don't want to work. To get around this, people who want to take the job root should be required to do check ins to confirm what they are spending money on, how much time they are actually at home, if they are taking them to places they need to be and so on. Not that much to ask tbh.\n\nBasically I wish they would turn the system from hay to grass pls.",
