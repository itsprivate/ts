Not today and probably not tomorrow, but I can see the trend in my life and I don&#39;t see it getting better. Truth is that some people are dealt a bad hand and don&#39;t have the energy to do something about it - and I am not alone in feeling like this. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not telling you this to get pity (I will ignore any DMs or messages of sympathy). I&#39;m telling you this just because I want make it clear that I am not foreign to the subject.</p>\n\n<p>While I do spend most of my days in a &quot;stable state of sadness&quot;, where I am indeed sad but I don&#39;t really have any impulse to harm myself, cry, scream or break stuff - sometimes events trigger a crisis-like state in my head where I begin to get offensive and abusive intrusive thoughts that repeat for hours, I cry until I feint, and then I just lay in bed waiting for it to go away.</p>\n\n<p>When in bed, reddit is my primary source of entertainment, and the thought of heading to a community dedicated to helping people in a dark place is always attractive. I do what most in my place do: open a thread on <a href=\"/r/SuicideWatch\">r/SuicideWatch</a> or <a href=\"/r/depression\">r/depression</a>, type out some semblance of explaination of what is going on, send it and just wait for a response or someone to talk to.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I want to ask a question to someone who is generally in a good state of mind. Why would you subscribe to <a href=\"/r/SuicideWatch\">r/SuicideWatch</a>? Why would a happy man or woman go out of their way to look up a suicide-related community, subscribe to it, and start engaging with the people inside it? As it turns out, most people don&#39;t do this. Which is to be expected - why would they?</p>\n\n<p>What this means is that, in my experience, the categories of answers you get in these places are the following.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No answer at all. This is the most common one - most of the threads remain empty, which makes everything worse. The last thing you need when you&#39;re in a dark place, is yet another attempt at getting help being ignored. It cements in your head the idea that you&#39;re worthless, nobody cares about you or your problems, and will just fuel further sadness. Since this is a community where people <em>mostly go to get help</em>, it isn&#39;t suprising. And mind you - I am not pointing any finger, it is not these people&#39;s duty to respond. I am critiquing a flawed system. </p></li>\n<li><p>Answer from fellow suicidal people who shift the discussion to themselves. They tell you they are sorry for what you&#39;re going through, and then they write a comment talking about their problems. Again - understandable, but what am I supposed to do about your problem when I am inches away from drinking bleach? </p></li>\n<li><p>People who direct message you. Jesus Christ, these are the worst, and most of these communities have even banned the practice for good reasons. If you want to experience what the creepiest, most pathethic individuals on the internet have to offer, try the following (as I did, as an experiment): create an alt reddit account, write a thread on suicidewatch where you pretend to be a woman, and just wait to see the armies of men who contact you offering their help. The same doesn&#39;t happen for men, as they are mostly ignored - this is obviously people who are looking to take advantage of emotionally compromised women to get laid. You then have people who contact you trying to convert you to a fucking religion, people who guilt trip you into not killing yourself because you&#39;re going to cause suffering in the people around you... and so on.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, on rare occasions, you get someone who seems interested in listening to you. But these are few and far between, and don&#39;t do much to offset the negative effects that these communities have. I am convinced that, if these communities were to be closed overnight, and replaced with a more moderated place where actual trained helpers are paid by reddit to give support, things would get better. </p>\n\n<p>This is obviously not going to happen though, as I understand it would be a cost that brings no advantage to reddit. The next best option is to just close them, then. I would much rather prefer being left alone, instead of being given the illusion of not being alone only to be reminded it was a lie.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
