I understand there is the science and the push to get everyone vaccinated so we can ALL have a better life and get back to normal.  However, I can’t help but think that this is also the fault of governments long term neglect of the people and really not doing much to help the average Joe.  Standing by and letting big business bleed us to death, adding shady language to bills at the very end of bills to pass in the benefit for the rich, so on and so on.  A lot of hesitation with the vaccine is because people don’t trust the government and more importantly, they do not trust what they say or put out.  They make promises and break them, all in an effort to gain power.  There is almost no accountability, rules are different for certain individuals (specifically people with money and power). Do as I say, not as I do. </p>\n\n<p>Lack of trust is a real issue here for a lot of people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
