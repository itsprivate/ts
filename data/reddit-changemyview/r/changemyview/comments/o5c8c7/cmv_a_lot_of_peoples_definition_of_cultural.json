For example, saying a white person should not wear dreads, at the root of it, displays the same overall thinking pattern as when people wanted a pool drained because one black person swam in it. People try to act like they&#39;re all woke when they whine about most instances of things they think are cultural appropriation by saying that they&#39;re protecting marginalized communities by some rationale of righting past wrongs done by the ancestors of those in not so marginalized groups and somehow evening the playing field. The fact that white people are seen differently with dreads than black people, a common argument in favor of the modern paradigm of avoiding what some call cultural appropriation, is not going to be solved by saying white people should not have them. It&#39;s just going to promote that black and white people are more different than they really are.</p>\n\n<p>It all really comes down to a thought process along the lines of:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This thing belongs to my group. You&#39;re not in my group, so you can&#39;t participate in this thing that is for my people and my people alone. If you try, I feel threatened and scared, because you&#39;re different and foreign invaders into our traditions and property must be stopped.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Historically marginalized or not, left or right wing, most people have a tendency to try and think this way in some fashion or another, with the only difference a lot of the time being the way that thinking is packaged and worded, and it leads to a lot of unnecessary violence, stress, and strife.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
