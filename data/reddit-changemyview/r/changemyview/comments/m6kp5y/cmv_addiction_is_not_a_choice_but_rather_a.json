When this system is activated, the brain takes note of what it is doing and the fact that it is worth remembering and repeating in the future (to 'release' more dopamine). \n\nThe thing is, drugs that are normally used by people (painkillers, etc.) can create an increase in activity of the reward pathway by increasing dopamine transmissions. Thus, due to the way the human brain is designed, and because of the way these drugs activate a particular brain pathway for rewards, they can be abused. Drugs can also trigger a biological and behavioral response to engage in addictive behavior again, despite knowing the negative consequences or even no longer finding joy in doing drugs. \n\nSecond, some may think that taking drugs is just an impulse control issue but drugs also alter one's impulse control ability. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain involved in inhibiting impulsivity and delaying gratification; however, addiction affects the prefrontal cortex. It impacts it in such a way that is alters one's impulse control and judgement. This results in a pathological pursuit for rewards (brains reward system). This can also be a way for addicts to feel 'normal' again. \n\nSo, CMV...
