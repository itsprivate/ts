She forgot drinks (Same friend didn't get his beer when she brought the rest of ours over) and someone from the back had to come out to pitch in and there was this one part where we moved from inside to outside and I was trailing behind and she double checked with me what the others have ordered.  The place was half empty and she had about 2 other tables to take care of.  This girl was not overwhelmed in any way shape or form.  2/10 service.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BUT** it was pretty clear that she was trying, and our opinions were split clearly into two camps:  Those of us who came from the industry and those who haven't.  Those of us who did got all nostalgic in a brotherly, fatherly kind of way with \"Oh, I remember my first day... what a train-wreck that was\" and those of us who didn't, got really frustrated.  The friend who didn't get the beer was able to see his beer on the bar and had to be talked into not going over there to get it himself and the others were pretty grumbly.\n\n  \nAnd I get it- bad service sucks.  I've had service so bad that I had to walk over to the waitress station to ask our server, who was on her phone, for our bill after about 20 or 30 minutes of trying to flag her down.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you're trying and are still bad at your job, I have endless patience for you.  We all had a first day and if anything, I'd blame the owner for hiring her in the first place, but not everyone has previous experience to put on their resumes.",
