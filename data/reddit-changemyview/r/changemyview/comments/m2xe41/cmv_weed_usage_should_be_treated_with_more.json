I stopped smoking habitually in college. I still smoke occasionally, but just a few hits off a joint about once every 2-3 months.\n\nOnce I stopped smoking weed everyday, my overall life improved. I got significantly better grades, I was more social, I exercised more and ate better, and had more motivation.\n\nI saw my friends who continued to smoke habitually struggle with things and not even consider that weed could be a factor. They would struggle with grades, with handling responsibility, or wishing their social life was more fulfilling, etc, but wouldn't connect the dots.\n\nA specific example is a girl I knew who wanted to be a lawyer. She was studying hard for the LSAT, but also was a habitual smoker who would get stoned 3 times a day. She would smoke before studying. She kept getting low scores on her practice tests, was disappointed, and thought she wasn't smart enough. I tried to suggest that maybe studying stoned is not the best practice for retaining information and she was convinced that it was other factors.\n\nOn to my actual view, I believe that people should treat weed like a drug that actually has adverse effects. Getting stoned everyday should not be normalized, just like drinking everyday is viewed as harmful. It seems like all the people I have met who habitually smoke do not think it is a problem at all.\n\nI support the legalization of weed. I think it can benefit a lot of people medically and can just plain be a fun time. If you have some medical issue or depression and smoking every day helps, all power to you.  But can we please, as a culture, stop acting like someone who gets high everyday doesn't have a drug problem?\n\nEDIT: I specifically mean the culture that I am a part of, which is Millennials/Gen Z. I acknowledge that weed is not as culturally accepted people of older generations. ",
