I think there are reasons for wanting to change your last name when you get married, but there's no reason (in my opinion) for the woman to be automatically considered the one who should change her name. I understand that couples may want to have the same last name to feel connected, avoid confusion from others, give their children the same last name, etc., but this can be accomplished by either partner changing their name. \n\nThe only argument I have heard for why the woman should change her name when getting married is \"it's tradition\" or \"it's always been that way.\" I've even been told it's disrespectful to the man to not take their name. When asked why they wouldn't want to change their last name to their wives', they have no explanation. However, I do understand that men may be worried about feeling judged for changing their name. Traditions are changing all the time, and this on its own is a poor reason to justify pressuring women into abandoning their family name. Women are not seen as their husband's property anymore (by most people) and most women have their own careers and hobbies in developed countries. Changing one's last name can be harmful partway through a career, if one has publications/accomplishments tied to their previous name. \n\nThis isn't to say that men should automatically change their name instead, I just believe that neither person in the relationship should feel undue pressure to change their name, and they can make whatever decision works for them. If neither wants to change their name, they can hyphenate, combine their names, or simply keep their own names. Many people feel a strong connection to their family name, and they shouldn't be pressured to give it up immediately upon getting married because of a historical norm.",
