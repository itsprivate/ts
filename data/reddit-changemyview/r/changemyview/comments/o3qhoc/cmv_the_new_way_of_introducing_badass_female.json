Typically, it goes overboard and sounds edgy as hell, and the audience loses all respect for the character.\n\nSo thankfully, we've seen a decrease of it, until recently, where we're trying to get female protaganists to seem more badass, and as a result, making them seem shallow, insecure and unlikeable.\n\nHere's a specific example from a show on Netflix called Ragnarok.\n\n\"Badass\" woman who has god-like powers comes to a martial arts gym, finds a man who's practicing his wrestling, challenges him unprovoked. He looks at how small she is, and asks if she's sure about it. They start to spar and the man doesn't throw any hard punches until she yells at him to \"show some respect\" and proceeds to use her god-like powers to completely humiliate the guy, while blasting some \"badass\" music, and wearing a massive grin.\n\nObviously, completely disastrous to audience in terms of respecting her.\n\nWhy? Why is a literal god wasting her time challenging random mortals that she knows she can beat without breaking a sweat within a fraction of a second?\n\nAside from being pointless, it comes across as extremely insecure. What is she trying to prove?\n\nA literal god came in the form of a petite woman just to kick some poor random mortal's ass?\n\nThat's like me, a fully grown man, going to a toddler who's practicing karate at age 3, and beating the kid onto the ground.  Then strutting around like I was an \"Alpha Male\" for doing so, and being like \"Hah! I didn't even need to learn Karate to beat this kid! I'm so good!\"\n\nAnd this has pretty much become a universal thing in \"badass women\" films. It manages to be cringier than watching those \"alpha men\" somehow takeout an entire battalion of enemy soldiers who apparently don't know how to shoot their weapon or attack at the same time instead of one by one.\n\nLiterally the only message I can even concieve for these \"badass intros\" are \"Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover\". In other words, \"Don't assume this petite small woman with no visible muscle mass or weight could suffer serious injury if you (a trained wrestler) use all your brute force because she could secretly be an almighty god of nordic origin\"\n\nSomehow Audiences don't relate to that message.\n\nThis might be a farfetched theory, but I think these attempts, are a result of a misunderstanding of how males organize themselves in hierarchies. Forceful Subjagation (Bullying) isn't an effective means of rising in the hierarchy or getting respect, no man goes to another man, beats him into a pulp, and then earns the total respect and loyalty of the beaten and now submissive man. In fact, that's a sure fire way of making enemies, losing friends, and being knocked down to the bottom of the hierarchy by a better man. Such is a dumbed-down child-like comprehension of complex human behavior. If you want to know the main factor for a male's (or female's) position in their respective hierarchy, it's reliabilty. The more people rely on you, the higher you go. And if the people that others rely on, rely on you, then you're probably at the very top of the pecking order.\n\nBit of a tangent, but does anyone else feel like that could be the case for this behavior?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw for the purposes of discussion, here are some examples of what I consider to be well-made \"badass\" female characters.\n\nAshoka Tano - Star Wars\n\nAlita - Battle Angel\n\nScarlet Witch - Marvel\n\nKatniss Everdeen - Hunger Games\n\nEdit: I can't believe I forgot to add Ripley from Aliens to this list.
