However, with living in a rural area of a heavily rural state I&#39;ve only ever seen 1 person or advertisement advocating for rural STEMification and that was with a recent gubernatorial candidate who has a STEM background in a rural state. It seems, given that disparity, that the concern isn&#39;t STEM education. I want to know why, as it seems, rural America, specifically it&#39;s education, isn&#39;t important to those who advocate for educational increases and such.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you all for this discussion, the subreddit did its job and has changed my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
