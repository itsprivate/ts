  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was having this conversation with my gf today, who is asian (which is applicable, explained later.) I basically take the viewpoint that no matter how abhorrent, unless in the most extreme circumstances, should you condemn someone’s line of reasoning/ morality for almost any given topic. To put it better, racists, homophobes, xenophobes, etc, should be given the benefit of the doubt and you should show that you have thoroughly thought through their perspective. </p>\n\n<p>imo, most people are good people or at least believe that they are doing something for just or good reasons. the conversation started with abortion where i said that given a fundamentalist christian’s line of thinking, i would think that their MORAL reasoning was completely sound given the moral framework they based their beliefs off of. I don’t agree with it given a risk/benefit standpoint but that wasn’t the convo. I was simply saying demonizing people never leads to change of heart, it leads to entrenching of their beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>The real thing that made me question was the racism. She brought up racism, particularly black/asian racism (prevalent in america) and said that given her and her friends (growing up in a predominately black area) experiences it shouldn’t be excused. as a white dude growing up in the country i never really had experience with this but i could only think of Daryl Davis. I still ultimately think that we should try to show people that we considered things from their perspective to at least try to convince them but idk i can be convinced.</p>\n\n<p>There’s been a recent trend of “fuck you if your moral opinion doesn’t align with the exact status quo” imo and most of the time i agree with the people doing the accusing (in opinion not methodology of solving these problems.) To put it simply, i feel like mudslinging/shaming is never beneficial even when it seems like it’s an inherent moral truth.</p>\n\n<p>The only exceptions i make of this is obvious inherent moral wrongs (child abuse, cold-blooded murder, rape, etc; these definitely qualify for the “bad person” label)</p>\n\n<p>I can add additional detail or clarification in comments if necessary because i feel like i didn’t get my actual question or point across fully and mobile reddit is ass.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
