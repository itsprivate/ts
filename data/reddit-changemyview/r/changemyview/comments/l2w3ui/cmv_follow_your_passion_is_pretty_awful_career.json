But if you're still dedicated to the ethos of \"follow your passion\" from a career perspective, that means you'll need to abandon whatever career you've built and start again.\n\nAnd even if that next thing becomes successful, passion fades. So you'll have to move on again. And again.\n\nThere are more responsible, balanced ways to look at career that don't involve the fleeting nature of emotion and inspiration. A passion-based ethos is far too volatile.\n\nNow... I know it's not required but I'd like to include a bit about *why* I want you to change my view here...\n\nBecause truth is I've had well over a dozen careers. Some white collar, some blue collar, some spiritual... A few I loved for a bit and then hated. A few I loved and then, later, just kinda liked. But eventually my restlessness would get the better of me.\n\nAnd I want you to convince me that that was okay... because I feel a lot of guilt about this personality flaw of mine. I have a wife. I have a kid. They would have benefited from more stability over the years, I'm sure of it. And at this stage my wife has been forced into being the main breadwinner of the family because I'm so damn... flighty.\n\nAnd ya it's true that's actually worked out really well in the end. She's incredible and it's amazing that she brings her genius to the world.\n\nBut... I know it would be better if I could be a lot more reliable, or could have spent the last couple of decades building expertise in *a single industry*. I feel like I've let her down even though she would never say so.\n\nSo CMV. I'm wide open.\n\n**Edit**: this post was seemingly hidden for about 3 hours and as soon as I went to dinner replies started popping up... sorry will get back to you asap",
