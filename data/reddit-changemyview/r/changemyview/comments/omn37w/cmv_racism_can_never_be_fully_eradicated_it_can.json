  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Racism has existed for all of human history. There has never, in the history of existence, been a single person who was 100% not racist. Never. Even you reading this. We are all innately prejudiced. Through how we are raised/taught, some of us are more outwardly racist than others, but we all contain some degree of it.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say we can’t achieve a point where racism is negligible, and that we shouldn’t strive to minimize it. Of course we should! All it means is that racism will not go away completely, and the modern crusade against every “micro aggression” is dumb.</p>\n\n<p>The only way racism will go away is if humans continue to breed inter racially until there is but one “race” or skin color. But, your classic “skin color” racism would just be replaced by some other innocuous trait. “Oh, fuck those blue eyed people they’re dirty. They come from the north and their country is bad. And those people over there, with the blonde hair, they think they’re better than us, but their hair is ugly and undesirable.”</p>\n\n<p>Humans are jealous, vengeful, spiteful, and greedy creatures by nature. That’s how we’ve evolved. As an animal, you don’t survive in the wild and overcome natural selection by being “kind.” Those animals never existed because they starved to death compassionately letting others eat all the food.</p>\n\n<p>People will always find ways to hate each other. Not for the sake of hating, but for the sake of feeling superior. People invent bullshit to get upset about to justify their selfishness. Race, Religion, Nationality, Sexual orientation, gender identity, favorite sports team, Chicago or New York pizza, Nike or Adidas, it doesn’t matter.</p>\n\n<p>The last few in that list seem quite frivolous. That’s the point. No matter what, people will want and try to be seen as better than others. Isn’t it absurd that people care so much about what team a person watches, what type of pizza someone prefers, or the type of music they listen to alone on their own time? Yea, it is.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s even more absurd is the idea that those same people are going to suddenly put all of these extremely glaring physical differences aside and transform into a harmonious community of perfect people.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, but it’s just that. No hashtag can undo all of evolution. No protest can undo all of human history. No propaganda can change the most fundamental aspects of human psychology. Good luck trying, though.</p>\n\n<p>It is impossible to teach a person not to be racist. You can only teach a person how to be mindful of their own racism, acknowledging that it exists, and to manage it in such a way that doesn’t result in future genocide.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
