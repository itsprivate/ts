Most people don't get any help following the rules, such as keeping tack of them, or understanding them, and if they break them, regardless of weather they know they broke them or not, you punish them. Then, you write a legal code, say, how people have to pay for the game which is thousands of pages long all in obscure language so complex that you need professionals not only to keep track of it, but just to understand what it is. Additionally, you only provide these professionals to individuals after they break the rules because there just aren't enough of them to advise everyone 24/7 on how to follow the rules. One things can be easily concluded from this example: you are apparently an asshole.\n\nThe nature of laws places responsibility to follow and understand them on every individual subject to them, and yet 1) the laws people are expected to follow are so complex that probably no individual knows off the top of their head every single law, and even worse 2) the laws can only be totally understood and properly interpreted with a legal degree that as a society we cannot possibly give to every person.  If we cannot expect them to know the rules, then we cannot expect them to follow the rules.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying the state should do less, far from it I'm an unabashed socialist. Rather I'm saying that we oughtn't to have state intervention that those who must follow it cannot understand. Perhaps a state may justifiably create restrictions, such as driver permits where in order to follow the do an act you must understand the particular rules around that act, but that isn't how we do most things. There is no \"taxpayers ed\" you are given by the state to know of to follow the thousands pages long tax law or anything like that. There is no \"parenting ed\" you are given by the state to know how to follow parental regulations with your children. Either 1) the law should be so simple everyone can learn it in school, or at least 2) the law should be simple enough that the average person can learn it given minor degrees of guidance.\n\nIf there are so many rules you need an expensive professional to know them, there are too many rules to reasonably expect you to follow. If the rules are so complex you need an expensive professional to understand them, the rules are too complex to reasonably expect you to follow.",
