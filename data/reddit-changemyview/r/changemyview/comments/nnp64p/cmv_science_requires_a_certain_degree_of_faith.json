The average person does not have the time or understanding to become fully educated on a subject. It takes a lifetime to get there. Therefore, their views which are \"backed up\" by science are actually just backed up by faith that whoever did the science did it properly. You are putting your faith in scientists so to speak.\n\nYes, science is different from religion in the sense that in theory you could study a topic and hopefully arrive at the same conclusions that others got to independently of you. But, the average person can't do that so they must treat it as a faith.\n\nPeople often also misunderstand science and you see it all the time on reddit. A common example is when people link peer reviewed articles and use it as \"proof\" for their argument. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of science. For one, a few articles are not proof, they are evidence, and there's a big difference there. For two, the scientific method requires reproducability and repetition. Linking 1 or hell even 10 articles may not be sufficient evidence, the more articles there are, the stronger the evidence is, but something can't be taken as truth unless it has had dozens of articles published all arriving at the same conclusion.\n\nLets say someone actually does read the articles, ond of the few people who actually do. Most likely, what they mean is that they read the abstract or maybe even the introduction. But, I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that they didnt read the methodology, results, or discussion sections. Id bet that they always completely skip over the statistics part. And I don't blame them, statistics is a very complicated subject and even if they did read it I highly doubt they would understand it.\n\nSpeaking of statistics. As I mentioned, it's a very complicated subject. Science is often used as almost a synonym for \"exact\", or sort of the opposite of 'art'. Art is usually taken to mean something that has a degree of humans making almost arbitrary instinctive decisions. This applies to science as well. There is art in science, it's not as exact as most people like to believe. Statistics is a great example and also highlights why dozens of studies are necessary to be confident in a conclusion. Statistics and study design deals with trying to factor for all the biases and unknowns. The problem with that is, how do you know that which you don't know? How do you know you accounted for everything? You can't know, and that's where the art is in designing studies well. This \"unknowability of the unknown\" is also why linking a handful of studies is weak evidence. It can be STRONGER evidence than what the other side has presented, but it's still weak evidence. You really do need dozens of studies done by many independent researchers to be able to claim strong evidence for something.\n\nTo conclude, science requires faith and it's unavoidable for the average person. You're putting your faith that the scientists who are also just human did a good job. The scientific method only works so far as the humans who practice it practice it properly. And that is frequently not the case.\n\nThat's not to say this is bad. Science is the best thing we got. It's just an inevitability, a fact of life that can't be avoided that we do need a certain degree of faith for it.",
