We are not trying to 100% prevent COVID as that is not what vaccines do, they are just priming the immune system for when it encounters COVID. Everyone I know is adamant about avoiding COVID (as they should), but don&#39;t understand that the vaccine is not an impenetrable wall. We don&#39;t try to prevent the seasonal flu, vaccines for that are like 30-50% effective generally, people still get it and the goal is to be less severe than not being vaccinated. Hospitals are at 100% capacity every winter with cold and flu. COVID will be around indefinitely, hopefully it&#39;s just a cold if you get your vaccine +/- potential boosters down the road, American perception needs to change on what vaccines do and that we will still have the occasional COVID case going forward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
