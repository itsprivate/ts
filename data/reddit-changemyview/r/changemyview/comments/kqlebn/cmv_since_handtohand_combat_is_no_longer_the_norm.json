Nowadays, however, wars are fought using guns, boats, planes, cars, bombs, tanks, hacking, and the like, all of which physical differences do not affect (in other words, a soldier stepping on a mine is losing their legs, man or woman), and yet in most of the world only men are still drafted or expected to fight and not women (such as the Selective Service in the United States). As far as I know, no religion prohibits women from fighting in the military and defending their country, so I do not think it is a matter of religion. In my opinion, it is blatant sexism, but I would be more than happy to know everyone's thoughts. Of course, they would be given any necessary objects not needed for men (for hygiene and such), and they would be split from the men (no intergender squads for reasons such as turning from collaboration to competition).",
