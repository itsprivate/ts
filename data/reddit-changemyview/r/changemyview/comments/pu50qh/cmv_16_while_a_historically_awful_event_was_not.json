Does it seem reasonable that Trump actually wanted to just kill every member of Congress who opposed him, and expect to somehow retain power after that? Trump is stupid, but is he really that stupid?</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, think about how many moving parts there would have to be to pull this off. How many people would need to be in on the secret? At the very least, some of the cops, some of the protestors, some people in Trumps inner circle who helped coordinate, and probably more. If there really was a plan to storm the capital and harm political figures, how did they manage to keep it secret so well?</p>\n\n<p>We’re basically left with a plot that was both too stupid for anyone to attempt, and too hard for anyone other than an absolute genius to have pulled off. How is that a likely possibility of what happened?</p>\n\n<p>There’s been countless talk about “investigating the events of 1/6”. In my opinion, the only realistic possibility  that will be uncovered is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>-Trump constantly claimed fraud. Unclear if he actually believed in fraud or was using it as an excuse.</p>\n\n<p>-Trump tried to convince as many people as possible that fraud was real. This was either because he really thought he could overturn the election, to provide an excuse for his loss, or both.</p>\n\n<p>-A fairly large number of people actually believed this fantasy that the election was fraudulent. As a result, some of them got rowdy at a protest and actually managed to breach the capital.</p>\n\n<p>-Trump was very possibly not upset about this event. However, I can’t imagine a scenario where this event was part of an orchestrated plot to overturn the election, or remain in power by force.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
