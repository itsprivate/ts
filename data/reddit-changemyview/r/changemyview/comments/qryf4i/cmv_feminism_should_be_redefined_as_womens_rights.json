However, in practice, I see that feminism is virtually completely about eradicating women&#39;s disadvantages over men and almost nothing about eradicating men&#39;s disadvantages over women.</p>\n\n<p>It just doesn&#39;t fit the definition to the full extent. It&#39;s quite literally in the name &quot;femin-ism&quot; itself <strong>(if it only has the term for &quot;woman&quot; in it, how can it claim to represent both sexes?</strong>). Because of this, men&#39;s rights activists aren&#39;t seen as feminists, even though they fit the theoretical definition of it. Empowering men/boys is <strong>seldom</strong> considered to be feminism. Hence, I think feminism should be used for &quot;women&#39;s rights activism&quot;, with the old definition to be moved to &quot;gender equ(al)ism&quot;). I think (healthy) feminism and (healthy) men&#39;s rights activism should be considered two aspects of the larger umbrella term of gender equ(al)ism, that&#39;s all.</p>\n\n<p>Two important notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is about practice, not theory. I consider feminism to be what feminists do. I just think feminism has a faulty definition that should be rewritten to better fit reality. &quot;&#39;Seeking equality between sexes&#39; is just the definition of feminism, you can&#39;t change that!&quot; is not a valid argument. This definition not answering to reality is the entire point of this debate.</li>\n<li><strong>I&#39;m not at all opposed to feminism. Feminism stands for a lot of very valid issues which urgently need to be addressed, and the vast majority of these issues does indeed affect women more than men. I acknowledge that.</strong> But that&#39;s not the point of this debate. It&#39;s not about whether these issues are valid or not; it&#39;s about what the movement of feminism is supposed to be <strong>about</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
