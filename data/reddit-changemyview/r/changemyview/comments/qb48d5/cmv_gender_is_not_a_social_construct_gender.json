A frequent comparison is made to money- something that has no inherent value(bits in a computer and pieces of paper), but one that we give value as a society because it&#39;s useful. </p>\n\n<p>However, I disagree with this, mostly because of my own experiences with gender. I&#39;m a binary trans woman, and I feel very strongly that my gender is an inherent part of me- one that would remain the same regardless of my upbringing or surroundings. My <em>expression</em> of it might change- I might wear a hijab, or a sari, or a dress, but that&#39;s because those are how I express my gender through the lens of my culture- and if I were to continue dressing in a shirt and pants, that doesn&#39;t change my gender identity either, just how the outside world views me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
