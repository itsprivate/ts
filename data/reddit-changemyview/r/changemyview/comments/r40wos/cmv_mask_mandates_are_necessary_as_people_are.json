In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to. </p>\n\n<p>As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like &quot;oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then&quot;, I don&#39;t see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.</p>\n\n<p>Other arguments I hear are &quot;muh government telling us to do things bad&quot;, to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can&#39;t do. </p>\n\n<p>There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I&#39;ve heard good argument for why kids shouldn&#39;t wear them, although those argument are stuff like &quot;they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence&quot;, not &quot;it&#39;s child abuse&quot; or some stupid shit like that. I think teenagers should have to wear them too though, this would only apply to young kids.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
