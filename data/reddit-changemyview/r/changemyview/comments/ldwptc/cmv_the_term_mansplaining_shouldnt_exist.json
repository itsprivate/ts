It further fuels divisions between men and women by attaching gender unnecessarily to a negative action or behaviour, creating a man v woman dynamic.\n\n2. It can be used to shut down conversations that should take place but may be uncomfortable for other reasons.\n\n3. It can make men feel uncomfortable about explaining something to a woman (particularly in a sensitive environment such as the workplace).\n\n4. It can be perceived as being an attack on masculinity in general.\n\n5. It can perpetuate the idea that women are not strong enough mentally to engage in toe to toe exchanges with men.\n\nThere are possibly other negative outcomes from this as well and I struggle to find any positives at all.\n\nOpen to my mind being changed!",
