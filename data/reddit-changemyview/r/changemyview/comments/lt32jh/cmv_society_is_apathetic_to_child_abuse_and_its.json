This is certainly worthwhile, but for us adult survivors who are past the delicate period of brain development, society has little for us. All research ever does is highlight the bad outcomes in adults survivors and talk about prevention. Yes, prevention is good, but what about those of us who have to live with it? I watched a lecture by a well known psychiatrist in this area, and he talked about how the course of any disease for these individuals is often worse and treatment outcomes tend to be unfavorable. He also noted the NIH generally doesn't sponsor studies that do not compare to a specific biomarker. Abused adults tend to have greater inflammation markers, for example. There has never been a real lead on how to fix any of that, just \"we should prevent this\", which the government never adopts. \n\nI just don't see any hope for people like me who endured all of that. There is no guidance on treatment, and society and the government don't care about what we went through. The psychiatrist I mentioned earlier discussed how difficult raising money for such studies are because of how uncomfortable the topic is for most people. After all, something so objectively negative has no positive spin, so it's to be expected. \n\nI just don't think society cares beyond a few group of researchers who focus more on prevention and not how to care for those affected by abuse.
