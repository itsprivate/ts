They include, but are not limited to: smaller brain volume, breakdown of brain inhibitory controls over raw emotions like anger and stress, impaired memory, learning, and judgment, reduced serotonin in the brain, reduced oxytocin and thus impaired social relationships and greater anxiety, less likely to respond to antidepressant treatment, have greater risk for metabolic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, renal failure, and so on. Even treatments for those may not be as a effective. Telomeres have been found to be shortened, between 7-15 years in one study. Years literally shaved off your life.

Oh and greater likelihood of substance use disorders and suicide. \n\nNow, many government agencies have undertaken research on how to prevent adverse childhood events (ACEs). This is certainly worthwhile, but for us adult survivors who are past the delicate period of brain development, society has little for us. All research ever does is highlight the bad outcomes in adults survivors and talk about prevention. Yes, prevention is good, but what about those of us who have to live with it? I watched a lecture by a well known psychiatrist in this area, and he talked about how the course of any disease for these individuals is often worse and treatment outcomes tend to be unfavorable. He also noted the NIH generally doesn't sponsor studies that do not compare to a specific biomarker. Abused adults tend to have greater inflammation markers, for example. There has never been a real lead on how to fix any of that, just \"we should prevent this\", which the government never adopts. \n\nI just don't see any hope for people like me who endured all of that. There is no guidance on treatment, and society and the government don't care about what we went through. The psychiatrist I mentioned earlier discussed how difficult raising money for such studies are because of how uncomfortable the topic is for most people. After all, something so objectively negative has no positive spin, so it's to be expected. \n\nI just don't think society cares beyond a few group of researchers who focus more on prevention and not how to care for those affected by abuse. Even they are summarily ignored by the rest of the government and society.",
