One of the big supporters for funding them more was the left wing former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It’s just not like the US here, our police are completely underfunded. They need more funding if you want to see an actual increase in quality, and there’s better sectors to get funds from for social services and whatever (supposedly the end goal of defunding the police). \n\nI just feel like it’s a slogan the U.K. left has copied from the American left with no critical thought about the differences between our countries, and police forces. Any fellow Brits who support defunding the police, or people of other nationalities who think they have something to add (maybe you disagree with my stance on the US), could you tell me what I’m missing?\n\nEdit - Very curious about what I'm being downvoted for more, supporting defunding the police in the US, or being sceptical about it in the UK.
