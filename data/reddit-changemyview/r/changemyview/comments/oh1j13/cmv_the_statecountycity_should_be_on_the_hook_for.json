  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Title is pretty much my view, but is part of a larger assortment of criminal justice reform ideas I have been kicking around in my head that, for the sake of brevity, has been reduced down to these two for now. </p>\n\n<p>The overall goal is to standardize the treatment of rich and normal Americans in the criminal justice system. Since I have no doubts that the wealthy would successfully prevent themselves from ever being treated as badly as normal people are, we should strive to make the criminal justice system as convoluted, inefficient, and overburdened for people of average means as it is for the rich.</p>\n\n<p>The two main planks are thus:</p>\n\n<p>A. The state/county/city should be on the hook for the entire cost of a criminal defense in a trial if the defendant is found not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>This would include, but not be limited to attorneys fees and fees to pay for the testimony of expert witnesses. Even a modest criminal defense lawyer will cost you thousands of dollars by the time your trial has finished, and that&#39;s just if they cut a plea deal. </p>\n\n<p>With this change, a defendant could potentially solicit capable criminal defense attorneys and expert witnesses on a contingency basis. The idea being that seeing a chance to send the government an invoice for all of the billable hours that a trial entails could very well entice them to take cases of people being railroaded. </p>\n\n<p>There should be no upper cap to this limit, just as there is no upper cap to what wealthy defendants can spend on their own defense. If the defendant can persuade professionals to provide millions of dollars worth of services in their defense, then the state should be require to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>This sort of dovetails into my second point, which is:</p>\n\n<p>B. If a person loses their job at any point during the criminal justice proceedings, including post-arrest but pre-arraignment, then the state/county/city should be on the hook for up to a years lost wages or wages equaling the entire duration of the trial, whichever is more times 2.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, person A makes $50,000/year. Person A is arrested on a Sunday evening and fired for not showing up Monday morning. By the time their trial is resolved, 8 months has passed. The state should then be required to pay person A $100,000 in restitution.</p>\n\n<p>There is a popular saying among law enforcement: “you might beat the rap, but you won&#39;t beat the ride.” Well this is an attempt to address that. People are often coerced into taking a plea deal because they fear what effect a trial may have on themselves or their finances. Well no one should be afraid to push back against accusations by the state. </p>\n\n<p>I also hold the view that it should be codified into law that a judge may not take the fact that a defendant forced a trial into consideration when sentencing, but that feels pretty heavy on its own so may warrant a different CMV, but would be happy to discuss it.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s a good starting place I feel. Am I missing anything here? Will any of these proposals lead to outcomes counter to my intended goals? I look forward to the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
