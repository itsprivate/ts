In fact I&#39;m from a country where we don&#39;t have credit cards and people buy brand new cars with cash and have minimal to no mortgage debt. As such, we also never have $999 instead of just $1000 for easier transactions and less headaches for accounting purposes.</p>\n\n<p>When I first came to the US, 15 years ago, this practice was odd to me. I&#39;ve never felt better about a purchase just because it&#39;s $999 instead of $1000 which let&#39;s be real after tax at the cashier it is well over $1000 anyways. If anything, I have absolutely been more furious whenever I see this stupid practice.</p>\n\n<p>Why is a bottle of water $0.99 instead of just a dollar nice and square? I also equally don&#39;t understand why a brand new car costs $57,257.82 instead of just $57,300 or $57,200? Whose nickle and dimming for 40 bucks and some odd change on a near 60k car? Specifically the 82 cents.... If it was upto me I&#39;d just put it at $57,000 and call it a day.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever people are selling things used on different marketplaces, they don&#39;t list their nintendo switch for 189.99, it&#39;s a nice round number like $200 or $190 at least which shows the general public also does not want to deal with this BS nor anybody cares. I&#39;ve never met someone when selling something used and they complained why the price is 1,200 instead of $1,199.98.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe in the past it did fool people and was something new and fun but now it&#39;s just stupid and honestly makes Americans look stupid if they really do feel better about a 60k purchase just cus its 1 cent bellow 60k....</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
