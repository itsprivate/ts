I'm from the UK so free public heathcare (NHS) is the norm. I think that if you refuse a vaccine - which is clearly safe if it is being offered by the NHS - then you shouldn't get treatment for the disease that the vaccine prevents, should you contract it. It is a huge drain on public resources treating people for diseases that can be vaccinated against and people that refuse vaccinations end up costing the public a huge amount more than the vaccination would cost, not to mention the waste of resources for other non-preventable diseases. To clarify, I'm only suggesting that this be the case if people are explicitly contacted and offered the vaccine and then refuse for reasons that are not medically/scientifically valid.\n\nI've been told by many people this is not a fair view but I haven't been given any good reasons for this. I'd love to hear some arguments for why I'm wrong that dont involve the standard misinformation rhetoric. I want a more positive view of the world so change my view.\n\nEDIT: A few people have questioned this, so for clarity, I'm not saying people shouldn't be able get treatment for diseases for which they have refused vaccination; but rather that they should be refused FREE treatment. They can burden the costs themselves if they fall ill, and this should be made clear when they refuse the free vaccine. Of course this assumes that the resources are available and the antivaxers should be at the bottom of the list of they are in short supply.",
