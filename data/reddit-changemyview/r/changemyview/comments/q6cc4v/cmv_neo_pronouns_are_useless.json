I can&#39;t even understand what those pronouns refere to, or how you could identify as something you just made up. Like, even if you made up your own gender, what would actually define that gender? And if you&#39;re against gender stereotypes then why even bother creating a new gender? You could just be a guy or girl that likes acting and dressing a certain way. If you dont want to identify as the existing genders than nonbinary is always an option. I don&#39;t know, if someone could explain it to me I might consider supporting it. Obviously I don&#39;t harass or judge anyone who does it, I just don&#39;t understand it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
