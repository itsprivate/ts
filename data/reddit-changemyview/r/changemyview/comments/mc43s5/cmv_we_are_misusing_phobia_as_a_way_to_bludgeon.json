We rightly should be pilloried for this misuse. Some context may be required:\n\n* I find trans people weird, off-putting and would generally like to avoid their spheres of influence online or otherwise if possible.\n* I will support common sense legislation that expands the rights of trans individuals (The only exception being self identification for sports but that is another matter rooted far more in safety)\n* To my more liberal friends, I am a bigot and a transphobe.\n\nHere is where the problem is. Transphobe here is being used to prop up moral absolutism and not an accurate summation of either myself or my view. I am but one such example. There is a key here, I do not fear trans induvial. I have made a decision, through some analysis of my feelings, and come to the conclusion that I do not find that lifestyling appealing and therefore will avoid it if I can. That is not missing logic nor is that a fearful way of thinking.

Next time you want to throw that word around, sit back and really ask yourself if it matches the definition. If it makes it easier, don't think about controversial uses of phobia.
