This goes against both the services’ terms and conditions, and restrictions on free speech in the law. Therefore they are right to ban them.”\n\n* On the other hand: “It is incredibly dangerous that a single company like Amazon, Twitter or Google could unilaterally decide to ban an entire viewpoint. There is nothing to stop them from doing the same thing to non-violent conservative voices, or even liberal ones, if they want to.”\n\nWhat baffles me is that these are pitted against each other as if they are opposing sides. To me, these are *both* 100% sound arguments, and their soundness does not interfere with each other.\n\nThe solution to the pseudo-monopoly held by Amazon and others is not to try and stop them from banning platforms like Parler when they fail to moderate the incitement of violence. It’s to invoke some kind of anti-trust law, which is a completely separate matter.\n\nTo me, what the two arguments really say, combined, is that we need to have a two-pronged simultaneous approach to the issue:\n* Allow Amazon to ban Parler, Twitter to ban Trump, etc.\n* AND work on some kind of anti-trust mechanism to reduce the amount of power these companies hold.\n\n____________________________\n\nI am looking for people to explain to me:\n* why they think these two arguments are actually in opposition to each other\n* or: why they think Parler, etc. shouldn’t be banned for other reasons\n* or: why they think the pseudo-monopoly of Amazon, Twitter, etc. isn’t really a problem",
