The relevant segment starts at 25:00. \n\nIn the call, Trump repeats over and over that he (Trump) believes he won the Georgia election by a large number, “X”. He then over and over implores the Secretary of State of Georgia to change the vote total — but not to a number Trump believes to be true — rather to just enough votes for him to win the state, “Y”.\n\nImploring the election official to change the total is a felony by [Georgia code title 21 § 21-2-604](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2016/title-21/chapter-2/article-15/section-21-2-604).\n\nThe immediate knee-jerk defense I’ve heard is, “well that doesn’t mean he intended to commit fraud. What if Trump actually just believes what he said? Then he just wants the true total.”\n\nHowever, even if trump is deluded and believes he actually won, or **even if he had actually won**, he goes on to solicit a fraudulent tally that is neither the real vote total, nor the vote total trump claims to believe that he won by. By his *own* words. \n\nTrump says:\n\n&gt; 'I just want to find 11,780 votes'\n\nWhich isn’t even the number he claims to have won by. It states his intent plainly. And that intent is corrupt and violates the law. \n\nIt seems uncontroversial given the facts of the case that trump committed this felony  — which by the way comes with a mimimim prison sentence of 1 year. It also seems like the only reason this isn’t getting more coverage as an obvious crime is that it’s already obvious that trump can break the law with impunity.",
