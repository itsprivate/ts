There are a few very basic flaws that are obvious to me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Devaluation of fiat. Fiat is already not in a great spot in many places due to the absurd money printing for COVID relief spending.</li>\n<li>Following that, a government is not going to allow something that further devalues their currency and then cuts into tax revenue on top of that, since Bitcoin is untaxable. I&#39;m fiscally conservative, but tax revenue is certainly necessary. Governments could fine companies who take Bitcoin, essentially taxing them and removing the incentive to use it.</li>\n<li>The fragmentation of the economy. You can&#39;t run a modern economy with multiple currencies, all holding different values that fluctuate wildly. If I go to the store with one dollar, I can be confident that the purchasing power of that dollar will be the same next week. Yes, inflation happens, but it is usually gradual and measured. My dollar will be able to buy me a candy bar next month the same as it can this month. Bitcoin (and other currencies that follow its lead) has wild swings of 10% within days, sometimes hours.</li>\n<li>Elon Musk has singlehandedly sent Bitcoin crashing with one tweet. You can&#39;t do that to fiat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t seen any good rebuttals to these very simple arguments. I see crypto as a gamble, not an investment. There is no thesis required, and the vast majority of crypto fans seem to do their DD by reading tweets from big holders that want to pump the price. There aren&#39;t earnings, balance sheets, SEC filings to look at for Bitcoin. The stock market can be irrational, yes, but crypto seems like it&#39;s very obviously doomed to fail.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
