Of all the people to go to, surely this is your worst option. Thier minds are already made up on the issue and extremely bias.\n\n Banning these practices would force people in this situation to seek help from a non-bias source. One that will openly allow them to explore thier feelings in a safe, non judgemental environment. \n\nI'm sure this post will be contraversial, but I also hope to understand this better because my mind is made up this issue for better or worse. I'm curious though how others are feeling about it, to me the choice here is obvious. Ban conversion therapy! \n\nEdit 1: I can see some excellent arguments for allowing religious freedom to a part of the decision to ban conversion therapy and I understand that there is an importance for the religious identity of the people in this situation to be considered. I also however feel that the term \"barbaric\" should be removed having read a little more about the process of conversion therapy. I do still believe however that the legislation to ban this practice should go ahead. There are just better ways to have this discussion in religious communities that don't demonise or shame those with this struggle. \n\nThank you all for taking part in the discussion and I would love to hear from people who have experience in conversion therapy to tell me more about it and how you feel it actually helps?\n\nSources: \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57059459.amp?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=upday\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-56496423",
