Can an eviction turn violent? Sure.</p>\n\n<p>However, removing someone from a property that they do no own is not an act of violence. An eviction can be simple… a letter or verbal notification that you need to leave. Nothing else has to escalate. No one has to force someone to leave.</p>\n\n<p>It is sad that some people maybe homeless but their are not owed a place to live that they do not own. A lease was most likely signed. An agreement. </p>\n\n<p>I am sure most people would hold rent if the landlord didn’t hold up their end of the agreement. Keeping the AC working, keeping pest out the home, getting the roof fixed and so on. </p>\n\n<p>Just a side note… she also claims that we are all closer to being homeless than being a billionaire 😂😂</p>\n\n<p>I mean… that’s pretty much true for everyone! Even  millionaires. Someone who has $20 million is closer to being homeless than becoming a billionaire!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
