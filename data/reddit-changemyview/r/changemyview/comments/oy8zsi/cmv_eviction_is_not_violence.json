Can an eviction turn violent? Sure.</p>\n\n<p>However, removing someone from a property that they do no own is not an act of violence. An eviction can be simpleâ€¦ a letter or verbal notification that you need to leave. Nothing else has to escalate.

An agreement. </p>\n\n<p>I am sure most people would hold rent if the landlord didnâ€™t hold up their end of the agreement. Keeping the AC working, keeping pest out the home, getting the roof fixed and so on. </p>\n\n<p>Just a side noteâ€¦ she also claims that we are all closer to being homeless than being a billionaire ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>\n\n<p>I meanâ€¦ thatâ€™s pretty much true for everyone!
