I want to be interested but every time the Olympics happen they just have less and less appeal. Can anyone change my view or say why we should really care all that much? I understand that people work their whole lives for this opportunity but it all seems like a bunch of college students who want to go and have sex on cardboard beds and no longer some huge national event.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
