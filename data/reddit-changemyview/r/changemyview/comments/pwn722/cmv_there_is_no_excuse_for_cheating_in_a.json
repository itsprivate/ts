  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Edit: I am talking about the USA, Canada, and other similar countries, not those where divorce is illegal or practically impossible.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot see there being a valid reason for cheating on a spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend. Especially when it comes to marriage, since you said your vows and promised yourselves to each other. I can think of a few reasons I have heard but none seem like valid arguments.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The person is just figuring out their sexuality. That isn’t an excuse to cheat at all. They should break up with their current boyfriend/girlfriend if they want to try other people out.</p></li>\n<li><p>They are in an abusive relationship. I can’t see this as a valid argument because I don’t believe anyone needs sex so badly they are willing to cheat if they are so scared of their abusive partner they can’t just leave the relationship. You would think they would be more scared of the consequences of getting caught if their partner was truly that abusive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their partner isn’t meeting their needs. If that’s a case, find a new partner.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Maybe someone will bring up a good point I haven’t heard of of explain one of these points in a way that makes it a valid argument, but I can’t see why anyone would have an excuse to cheat.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: While my views definitely haven’t en entirely changed, I do see that there is basically divergent severities to cheating. Someone cheating because they are abused is more justified than other cheating, and cheating just for the thrill of it or just because you want to try out other people is far worse than cheating when you can’t leave due to kids and financial reasons. While I still don’t think anything is a good reason to not just leave the relationship, not all cheating is the same and some cheaters deserve second chances while others deserve to never find love.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for the discussions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
