More of just a general discussion about the concept of democracy. Theoretically, a misinformed or ignorant public can do massive damage to itself and others by voting in a government or administration that is harmful or evil. Theoretically, if a literal Hitler 2.0 campaigned and ran for office, and the public decided that this is who they want, then this Hitler 2.0 is allowed to operate with a ton of power. This can have dire consequences including destabilization of certain parts of the world, and people can literally die from this.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a scientist comes out and says &quot;There is a massive asteroid heading towards earth. It will end human life tomorrow if we don&#39;t do something.&quot; Candidate A runs for office with a promise he will destroy the asteroid before it reaches Earth. Then, a Candidate B comes along and says &quot;This asteroid does not exist. We don&#39;t have the money to spend to put towards destroying this nonexistent asteroid. Vote for me instead.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The public then has the right to vote in Candidate B, and literally end all existence of human life. Obviously this is a very extreme example and not realistic, but the general point stands. A misinformed public will vote against their own interests, and they are allowed to.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
