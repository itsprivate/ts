It is not only inauthentic and borderline historical revisionism, but it just gives an excuse for the same old stories to be told. Europe is not the only place in the world with a history, there are plenty of fascinating opportunities for historical media to be set everywhere in the world- even if these are just a different perspective on things we have already seen. Example: why is there still next to no mainstream media portraying WWII in China? Or about the Mali Empire? It seems odd that we encourage forcing representation in the same stories instead of encouraging the exploration of new ones.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
