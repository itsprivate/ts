I don&#39;t understand! Well... I do understand how it&#39;s done but I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s better than the original method. I mean, if it isn&#39;t broken don&#39;t fix it am I right!? I know a lot of parents that are even more confused because they don&#39;t understand how this new maths is done therefore leaving them unable to help their children with maths that require them to show their work. Should they relearn mathematics? No! Because what they originally learned was not wrong, but I&#39;ve heard too many stories about children getting low grades as a result of their parents helping them with their homework because they &quot;did it wrong&quot; even though they had the same answers just different work shown. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: my view has been changed. Thanks for all your comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
