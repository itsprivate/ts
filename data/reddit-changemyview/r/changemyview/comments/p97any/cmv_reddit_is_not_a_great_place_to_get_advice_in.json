  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Reddit has a reputation wherein its users are generally introverted and have difficulty in making and maintaining relationships with people. After sometime here, it&#39;s pretty evident in subreddits i&#39;ve seen and some people that I have talked to. It&#39;s not wrong to be intoverted, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>\n\n<p>But in terms of asking advice about relationships whether romantic with your bf/gf or platonic with friends, I feel like some are sending bad advice and downvoting some that are not in agreement with them. Sometimes I see a minor problem with her bf then most advices given are to break up, it&#39;s his loss or you&#39;ll get a new one. Same thing with friends, can&#39;t get along with friends with some minor problem so go get new friends. There are other answers given that&#39;ll make you scratch your head other than that.</p>\n\n<p>However, I do understand that the whole introvert thing is only a general rule and there are some exceptions. But because of the anonimity of reddit, some are sending advice even if they themselves haven&#39;t solved the problem. So it will be tough to figure out who knows what they&#39;re saying and who are saying stuff &quot;just to help&quot;. That&#39;s not a knock on helpful people, it&#39;s just that some answers are more credible compared to others. Also since you are anonymous, negative stuff are thrown out like &quot;I don&#39;t see a problem, don&#39;t be a p*ssy, man up and get it done&quot;. I don&#39;t think stuff like that help you get over the hump.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
