I think with the correct education at a young age and clear consequences, we can effectively eliminate the more insidious, pervasive kind of sexism we see throughout society as a whole. The boss who makes inappropriate comments, the groping on the dancefloor, the slut shaming, the drunk guy who doesn’t take no for an answer. \n\nBut that conversation should be entirely separate from the one we’re having about Sarah. Whoever did this (I believe they have a suspect in custody) didn’t do so because he wasn’t called out for a off-colour joke in the lad’s group chat. He didn’t do it because he didn’t understand what consent was.\n\nHe did it because he’s mentally deranged and was capable of taking another human being’s life for his own gratification. And if we accept that these kinds of people will always exist in society, and historical precedent makes me firmly believe they will, then not only is police advice to “walk in pairs” prudent, it’s completely necessary and not, in any way, victim blaming. \n\nYes, of course it’s shit and unfair and completely at odds with a supposedly progressive society that we have to do this, but I think we have to treat any legislation or education as separate from these kinds of monsters. It’s simply falling on deaf ears and always will.",
