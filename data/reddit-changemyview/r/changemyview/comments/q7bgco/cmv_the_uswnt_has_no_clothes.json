In favor of the men having a good discrimination claim I guess?</p>\n\n<p>Last point that highlights that the different contract they negotiated actually did exactly what they wanted it to do:</p>\n\n<p>During COVID: the women continued to keep their guaranteed $100k salaries with basically no games played in 2020 (I think between the men and women US Soccer played like 3 games in 2020). The men were paid zero dollars during that time since they don&#39;t get paid unless they play a game.</p>\n\n<p>The women&#39;s team and their argument have no basis in fact. We have been lied to for 5 years about supposed pay discrimination. </p>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
