Biden and Trump didn't care much about marginal voters in most states because the polling already clearly showed which states the race would come down to. This means that almost all last-minute campaign spending and attention goes to swing-states. Also, it doesn't really matter if you vote if you don't live in a swing-state.\n\nA proportional system would make it so that your vote truly matters no matter which state you would live in. Swing-states would no longer really be a thing. Where am I wrong?\n\nEDIT: Many comments are just saying that a popular vote would be better than a proportional EC. I agree with that. And then I think ranked-choice voting would be even better than a popular vote.... but that is not what my CMV statement is. I am seeing if anyone can change my view that the current EC system is better than a proportional one.",
