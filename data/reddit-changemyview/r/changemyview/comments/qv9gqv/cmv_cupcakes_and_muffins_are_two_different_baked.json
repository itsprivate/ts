Growing up in the United States, I&#39;ve been exposed to both, and it&#39;s simple to spot the difference. Muffins tend to have a denser texture while cupcakes are looser in texture for the body and also tend to have more sugar and fats in them. Their batters have varying consistencies and a different combination of ingredients. Additionally, cupcakes tend to have frosting on top, while muffins can be either savory or sweet without frosting. I know the US was enjoying a cupcake craze the last couple of years, so this may be why I’m more attuned to their dissimilarities.   </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m posting this because I&#39;ve had friends from outside the US tell me that cupcakes and muffins are the same baked good and it&#39;s confusing to them that they have two different names. I&#39;m curious why so many people conflate them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
