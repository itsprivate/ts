If they are servicing any remotely busy location, some lazy asshole is inevitably going to get piss on the seat and not clean it off. As soon as that happens, all bets are off, no one from that point on sees it as their responsibility for cleaning the seat or bothering to even lift it. So it just gets more and more disgusting and piss-covered until some poor sap who actually needs to take a shit get&#39;s to play janitor for the privilege.</p>\n\n<p>The entire history of the public toilet has taught us that we can&#39;t rely on people to treat the utilities with any sort of respect. It only takes one person to throw the entire system into a disgusting chaos. So why do we continue to trust the system to the personal responsibility of the masses? It would be very easy to have a spring loaded toilet seat that physically required someone to be sitting on it in order to remain in the seated position. Anyone using the toilet to urinate would always enter a stall with the seat already up and out of the splash zone. The only time the seat would be exposed would be when someone intended to use it in the seated position.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit: To demonstrate, this product DOES exist. Aside from occasionally seeing it in a few public restrooms, as relayed by some users in the comments below, I&#39;m including this YouTube video that should more clearly demonstrate what I&#39;m talking about. Many commenters seem convinced that this would &quot;Flip up fast as soon as you got off it.&quot;, or that it would require some crazy large mechanism (the device in the video is entirely mechanical, and is not operated by electricity), or they just don&#39;t see what possible benefit it would provide in a public restroom.</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjgIUuot3yo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjgIUuot3yo</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
