If I were 80 years old—15 years younger than I am now—I would not be able to handle the stresses and duties of being President.”\n\nHe has a point. If you want to be a *good* President, you have to work pretty much nonstop, and it’s not easy work.\n\n**************************************************\n\nYou have to absorb new information quickly and to think critically about it. You have to be able to multitask and seamlessly move from one project to another, while giving each one your undivided attention and comprehensive study.\n\nYou have to negotiate with Congress, Governors, Mayors, and many more high-ranking officials in order to get anything done. Many of these people don’t like each other at all, and at least half of them hate you purely because of your political party. Are you capable of getting them in line?\n\nYou have to be woken up at 3 am to deal with international crises which may end the world as you know it. When you’re nowhere near your best, can you make that call?\n\nCall this ageism if you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s backed up by science. \n\n************************************************\n\nI’m not talking about cases where the President dies in office—we have a line of succession for that. I’m more talking about cases where the President is incapacitated, especially when *no one knows*.\n\nWhen Wilson had a stroke at the end of his term, who was in charge? How about Reagan, when he was battling Alzheimer’s? How about Trump, when he was hospitalized with COVID? If they were in charge, were they even capable of thinking clearly? If they weren’t in charge, why wasn’t America told?\n\nBut let’s assume we elect a one-in-a-million specimen, with no ailments or degenerative illnesses whatsoever. Okay. *They’re still not immune to aging.* Literally *everyone* goes through cognitive decline, and it’s not just when they’re elderly; it starts in their 40s and only gets worse.\n\n***********************************************\n\nCognitive decline doesn’t have to mean you’re a drooling invalid, either. It could mean that you can’t recall a certain aspect of a bill *quite* as quickly as you used to. Or it could mean that you don’t remember a detail of a Senator’s backstory which might’ve made negotiations much easier. Or it could mean that it takes just a *little* longer to make a decision in the Situation Room, which could make the difference between a mission’s success or failure. Or maybe it means you can’t make a point as clearly as you should’ve in a debate, which embarrasses the party and makes it easier for your opponent to be elected. Or maybe it means you can’t campaign as energetically, which does the same thing. Or maybe it means you can’t travel nationally or internationally as much, which could make certain states and foreign allies feel neglected, which is damaging for any number of reasons.\n\n************************************************\n\nAnd yeah, I’m sure everyone has that one grandparent who’s 110 years old and still sharp as a tack. First off, they’re almost certainly not as sharp as they were in their late 40s or early 50s. Secondly, they’re the exception, and a small enough minority that it’s ridiculous to generalize them as the entire elderly population.\n\nI’m not saying that there are no young people who are dim and incapable of the high-level thinking required by the Presidency. I’m saying that it’s *much more common* in the elderly, *scientifically speaking.*\n\n************************************************\n\nWho am I kidding? Either no one thinks about this, or no one cares.",
