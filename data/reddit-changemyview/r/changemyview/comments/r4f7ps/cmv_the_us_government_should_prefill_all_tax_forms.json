I&#39;m not sure what good reason there is to make everyone do it themselves (or pay someone else to help) from scratch, especially for those living on social security or disability payments. I believe the current practice puts an undue burden on all citizens, most of all those who can least afford to spend time or money sorting through their own financial situation in order to accurately file taxes every year. Can anyone offer a compelling reason we should keep doing things the way we are now?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
