The more heated they become, the bigger the strawman becomes. Maybe this is partially because it is easier to hate this imaginary person than to confront their own ignorance in their arguments and ignorance of their opposition, but it seems like the mind is trying to take an easy out with an uncomfortable situation. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am often ignorant of certain things in my own arguments, but I try to focus on what I actually disagree with in my opponent&#39;s positions, not fabricate my own reality about invented enemies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
