Not comparing it to another country. \n\nI can’t count the amount of times I’ve heard stories from people complaining about long hours/shit pay, and saying something like “oh well that’s life” or “it is what it is.” Hustle culture has been encouraged and accepted as the norm. People will brag about working 80 hours in a week as if it is a good thing. I’m not blaming the people who are subjected to this, but rather the glorification of this phenomenon. \n\nThe social safety nets in America is laughable. One of the wealthiest countries on earth can’t provide a large portion of it’s citizenry with healthcare? A large chunk of the population can’t afford higher education, and the wealth inequality is getting worse with each passing day. I don’t see an excuse for these egregious shortcomings.
