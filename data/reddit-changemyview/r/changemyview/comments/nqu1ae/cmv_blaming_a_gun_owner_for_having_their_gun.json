She is not to blame for the armed robbery that may happen afterwards with her own firearm. \n\nJohn and Lucy were both victims of a crime. You wouldn’t blame other victims of crimes if they failed to do as much as possible to stop it right? \n\nYour car got stolen?

You shouldn’t have been drinking, you should work out to be stronger or you shouldn’t wear that.\n\nYour house was burned down? Why didn’t you install a sprinkler system? \n\nNow if you have a restricted person, child or mentally defective person who is allowed access to your dwelling, sure, more needs to be done. That still does not mean that person can not be a victim of a crime. If those individuals are aware they are taking property that is not theirs... why should you blame a victim?
