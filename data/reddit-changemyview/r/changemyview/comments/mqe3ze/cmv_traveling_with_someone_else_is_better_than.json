  "selftext": "So traveling is one of my favorite things to do and it’s something I want to do a lot more very soon. That being said, I’ve never taken a solo trip. I’ve always gone with at least one other person. I’m sure it has its pros, but the pros from traveling with someone else are pretty significant:\n\nPro #1: You don’t have to plan everything alone. Someone else can help you with finding cheap plane tickets, booking accommodation, scheduling rides to/from places, planning an itinerary, etc. Its more work to do this alone and can be more stressful. \n\nPro #2: It’s Cheaper: A friend can split accommodation with you or pick up your dinner tab. This makes the whole experience cheaper for everyone involved. Traveling by yourself means you have to pay for everything. Not to say it wouldn’t still be enjoyable, but it’s definitely more expensive.\n\nPro #3: Better/More Pictures: When you travel with someone else, they can share pictures and videos they took with you. You both may have taken photos of the same attraction, but theirs may have been taken from a better angle or have better lighting. \n\nPro #4: You have someone to share your experiences with: The experiences and memories you have are what make a trip worth it. With someone else you have someone you can laugh and reflect on the great times you had. If you go solo, those great experiences and memories are with you only. You can share them with other people, but none of them will be able to reflect on them with you.\n\nPro #5: It’s safer: Of course anything can happen to anyone at anytime. But there usually is more safety in numbers. People are less likely to try and bother or harass you when you’re with someone else. By yourself, you tend to be more of a target.\n\nI’m considering traveling solo now because some of my close friends aren’t as interested or able to travel as much as I want too in the near future. While it’s something I’m opening myself up too more, I still think traveling with someone else is better.",
