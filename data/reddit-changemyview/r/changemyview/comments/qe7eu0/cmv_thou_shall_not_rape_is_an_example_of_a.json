This is because rape is never a solution to a problem. A person will not die due to a lack of sex. They may suffer mentally and emotionally but not solely from the lack of sex. Rape also does not allow a person to gain anything other than sex. You do not gain money from sex. And you do not gain any other necessity from sex. Rape also cannot protect a person from a situation, at least not in any situation that murder is a much better solution. For example, if a person broke into your home, it would be better for your safety if you were to kill the person or run away than of you were to rape them. And now that it I established that rape is never a practical solution, it follows that thou shall not rape is a good personal maxim. Everyone should follow it, and there would be no situation in which a person should rape.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
