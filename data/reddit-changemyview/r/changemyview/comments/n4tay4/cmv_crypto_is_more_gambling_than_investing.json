People are buying these random cryptos and calling it investing when the “investment” in question has nothing real to back it. You invest in a company, you get shares that increase or decrease in value based off how the company is doing. But with crypto it honestly seems like you just buy it and hope it works, then get pissed when it doesn’t. \n\nWhat’s the monetary backing to it? How is it worth any more money than people are willing to “invest” in it? What happens when it gets high enough and everybody wants to sell? To me it just seems like a way people are trying to make a quick buck and it seems like a formula for a lot of people to lose a lot of money. I know that’s a problem too or else I wouldn’t see 5 posts each day begging people not to sell their shit. \n\nI guess the biggest problem here is I don’t see how it works. People throw some money in, invite others like it’s their MLM to raise the value, and then sell? I guess I just don’t see how it’s an actual, sustainable investment rather than gambling.",
