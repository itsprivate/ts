  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>More and more I hear the discourse from &quot;illuminated&quot; entrepreneur, managers and CEO complaining that they can&#39;t hire people for work X, that people nowadays aren&#39;t willing to put in the work anymore, that it&#39;s hard to hire, and so on. And this comes from days before the current pandemic, so its not the cause either.</p>\n\n<p>Now, putting aside very narrow ultraspecialized fields or very small/closed countries, I think that&#39;s just a whole lot of bollocks. I&#39;ll give two examples I know:</p>\n\n<p><em>- Friend of mine applied to work to stack the shelves at a supermarket. She was 100% happy to earn any wage at all, and willing to work any schedule as she lived close-by. She was turned down (nothing bad there, of course, it&#39;s life). However couple days down the road I got wind through contacts that this manager was complaining &quot;can&#39;t hire anyone anymore, young people just don&#39;t want to work&quot;.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Here&#39;s the thing, during the crisis years, 2010-2017, young people got shafted hard, and instances of unpaid wage, paid below agreed upon value, unpaid work-time, and so on, became extremely common, with traditional legal solution proving almost ineffective. As a result, nowadays anyone with some education, basic knowledge of the law and a few contacts and favors (which are cheap enough) can defend themselves. And if that doesn&#39;t work... well, other ways do. So what hiring managers target for unqualified position are people that will not know HOW to defend themselves, that don&#39;t have contacts and friends to pull from, and so on. Essentially people that will just shrug and say &quot;well, I got shafted a month wage, it&#39;s life&quot; if at some point that don&#39;t pay.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>- I worked construction for a few years, a few month here, a week there, in between classes, etc. Earned about 2000-4000€/y doing that. Recently got many calls to come back, and they were offering about 5k-6k/y. Comparatively sweet. However, I finished my degree and got a more regular job, earning about 75k/y at the moment. Well, most of the companies manager I talked to were downright rude when I said &quot;I earn X atm, can you do better?&quot;. In fact one company I talked with went on the local news and complained that people just &quot;don&#39;t want to work anymore&quot;, and &quot;young people are freeloader, can&#39;t hire anyone&quot;. Nah mate, you&#39;re just paying shit wage. This worked 5-10y ago. But nowadays the economy is better, unemployment is way down and so on.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t people to hire. Even very specific experts, you can almost always pay extra and they&#39;ll come from further in the region. It&#39;s that people got wise to the crisis-era tricks, and that you want to pay 2013 wages in a 2019 economy. You can&#39;t hire or retain people because you give shitty conditions and nowadays people have alternatives. Simple as. And yeah, brain-drain is a thing, because you pay poorly. Pay more, retain the brains. It&#39;s not rocket-science.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
