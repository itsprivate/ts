I would like my view changed because right now I&#39;m a pessimist. Please note that this post isn&#39;t about lowering population (as that can be changed with immigration) but rather with &#39;born on the soil&#39; declining birth rate. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone else, but I would think there are plenty who are just like me. I don&#39;t want kids because I don&#39;t think its justified to make a kid go through what I go through, worrying about finances in this really expensive country. (Canada) \nSecondly, kids are expensive. We can&#39;t incentivize people like me to have kids. Now, people compare this to people in Zimbabwe or Nigeria. The difference however is, having a kid is an investment that has a higher guarantee of return. (While I hate that people use kids as tools to better their lives, I&#39;m gonna try being objective) in other countries, despite being in poverty, people have kids. I mention the guarantee return because society pressures people to take care of their parents. In Canada, I don&#39;t feel as much of it. People dump their (asshole) parents. Justified or not, there is no guarantee they will help out. The money spent on kids can be spent on saving for retirement homes. </p>\n\n<p>We also can&#39;t artificially make prices go down without sacrificing freedom that a lot of people like. </p>\n\n<p>The difference in Canada and other countries is also the laws. Its illegal and enforced to starve your kid. Why would I have a kid, even if i was selfish, if I knew that any moment and my &#39;investment&#39; would be gone. And I speak as someone who had family that grew up third world poverty. (my family is Chinese) </p>\n\n<p>There is also no incentive for me as an incel (male or female) to put up with shitty partners to make a baby. I don&#39;t need a man to work and fund me. So unless we are going back to women can&#39;t work laws, I think its inevitable there will be more single people. I don&#39;t mean to sound edgy, but I pretty much don&#39;t need a man, economically speaking. </p>\n\n<p>I hope I&#39;m not all over the place, but basically, unless we address the high cost of living, there&#39;s just no incentive to raise a kid. We also need to address how to incentivize people to get into relationships and make babies.</p>\n\n<p>in the past women had to put up with men&#39;s bad behaviour. Now? Why should I put up with shitty men? (Not saying all men) let&#39;s say I have high standards. If it means that I may ignore 90% of the population, so what? There&#39;s no incentive. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr: there just isn&#39;t anyway to incentivize people to have kids unless we are OK being authoritarian or giving up our economic model.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I sort of changed my view that we should talk about it and try, but as of yet, I see no solution that would get people to have kids unless it makes their life better. Such as, as sick as it is, allowing people to profit in having kids. That to my view has always been why humans have kids. It makes life happier when those who want have kids. Some others use kids to help with the farm. If having kids is a negative (ie spending money etc) then people will not have kids</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
