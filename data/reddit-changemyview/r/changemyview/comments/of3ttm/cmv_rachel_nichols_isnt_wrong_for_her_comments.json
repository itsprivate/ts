  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It’s been recently reported that as of now , Rachel Nichols has been removed from the NBA finals crew. For those that don’t know what’s going on , basically , There was a tape recording that came out of Rachel basically saying that she felt she lost her lead position as an NBA finals reporter last year to another reporter , but she felt the decision wasn’t made based off skill or the better reporter , Rachel felt like that decision was made due to the fact that ESPN wanted to look good as a company. To put it into context , this happened right around the time last year in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. It caused a lot of attention to be more focused on America being better as a whole towards African Americans. So Rachel felt that she loss her job to cover the NBA finals due to pressure that ESPN was receiving from the media. My whole point in this post is that , I don’t feel like Rachel is wrong for her comments , I think thats just a women who is not only competitive, but works hard and wants her hard work to pay off. I’m sure she has nothing but the up most respect for Maria Taylor , but I’d be lying if some of what Rachel said isn’t true. Not to mention when the roles are reversed , Stephen A. Smith tore Steve Nash apart for getting the job as head coach for the Brooklyn Nets insinuating that Steve Nash got the job due to white privilege. I don’t feel like neither one of Rachel , or Stephen A. Smith’s take is disrespectful or *acist. I just feel like people are expressing their opinions, and in a situation like Rachel’s, I don’t think she deserves to be punished. The real blame should be towards ESPN for making a decision so important due to pressure , not from a genuine space.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
