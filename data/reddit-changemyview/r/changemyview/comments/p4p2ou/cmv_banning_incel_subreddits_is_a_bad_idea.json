Banning their communities simply moves a majority of those users to more fringe websites or message boards where those toxic ideals can be echoed in an even more isolated environment. I think most of the “incel subs” tend to stay in their own bubble due to shadow banning and the quarantine system, and there’s a higher chance of those individuals changing their opinions on a website that promotes views contrary to their own. I’m an advocate for rehabilitation over incarceration and I think the same holds true here. If I was presented with evidence that banning these subreddits provided any benefit other than making other than entertaining people I might change my mind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
