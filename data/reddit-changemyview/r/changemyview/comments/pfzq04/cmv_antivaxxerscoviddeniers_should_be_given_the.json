I&#39;m sure this stems from frustration with conservative propaganda and general psuedoscience treatments such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine before that, as well as the cognitive dissonance in such people that willingly accept treatment from medical professionals once they are in such a state that would put them in the ICU.</p>\n\n<p>I believe many people on Reddit believe antivaxxers should forfeit their right to medical treatment because they are a threat to public health. After all, while many may not experience the worst effects of Covid and its variants, they can spread the virus to those who will.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I hope I&#39;m not of the unpopular opinion that generally wishing death and pain upon others. That is in essence what those who want preferential treatment for those who choose to remain unvaccinated are doing. I&#39;m also sure that such preferential treatment without the necessity of triage would violate some ethical code or form of Hippocratic Oath that doctors abide by.</p>\n\n<p>In summary I think some need to seriously evaluate their humanity when it comes towards people that they don&#39;t agree with. Doctors don&#39;t pick and choose who they treat unless the situation is extremely dire. While antivaxxers do hold dangerous beliefs that affect themselves and others, education and understanding how the modern antivax movement gained so much traction seems like a better alternative than letting misguided people die when they could be saved.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
