  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think it is safe to say that by this point in the pandemic, everyone in the United States possesses a mask. As an American, prior to the pandemic I had never seen anyone wearing a mask outside of a medical or hazardous work environment situation… except while overseas. When I was stationed in Japan, from time to time I saw people wearing medical masks out in public. Upon further inquiry, I learned that it was polite to wear a mask in public if you had a cold or were recovering from an illness, to help stop the spread of germs. Here in the United States, you are supposed to stay home from work and public if you are sick, but for a variety of reasons we all now that doesn’t always happen. I think that post COVID, after mask mandates are lifted everyone should be free to wear or not wear a mask as they see fit. However, we should shift our societal norms to encourage masking in public for those who may be recovering from a minor illness such as the flu. Aside from helping reduce the spread of colds and other nuisance illnesses, it would give others a social cue to keep their distance and/or to be diligent about washing hands after coming into contact with these people. My view that I am open to having changed is that the Western World needs to have a cultural shift on public masking after the pandemic, and encourage the use of masks among those who may be more likely to potentially spread germs after the pandemic. Change my view!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
