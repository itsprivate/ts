Duckduckgo runs a perfectly sustainable business by only showing ads based on search terms.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But you get much more relevant ads to what you want to buy&quot; shut up. Everyone knows not to click on internet ads because they give you viruses. Most Facebook ads are for scams anyways.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But no one else has access to your data and it&#39;s completely safe&quot; shut up. Rogue employees, hackers, and with one subpoena the government has your data. Companies like Google and Facebook don&#39;t deserve our trust.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about&quot; shut up. Privacy is a right and if people don&#39;t want to be spied on they shouldn&#39;t be spied on</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But you can opt out&quot; that&#39;s cute. I opted out of data collection and still got ads for Miller lite right after I opened my last one</p>\n\n<p>Was there anything else I missed?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
