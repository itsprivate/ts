This group of extremists led a political campaign to legislate a law that banned women from walking in the streets without veiling themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This decade-long campaign failed and was brushed off by most women in Egypt</p>\n\n<h1>--&gt;Enter Iran.</h1>\n\n<p>In 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini was elected president of Iran, remember this is the same man that sanctioned the assassination of an Indian national, by the name of Salman Rushdie.</p>\n\n<p>Khomeini didn’t waste any time and one of the first things he did when he held office was follow in the footsteps of Hassan el Banna and impose legislation that any woman that is spotted not wearing a veil in public be punished with 74 lashes.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, this encouraged and re-ignited the Egyptian Muslim brotherhood to want to “veil their women”.</p>\n\n<p>This time around, instead of trying to use the law to force women to veil themselves, the MB used their oil money to launch and finance the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Uu36ekmU3U?t=199\">biggest gaslighting campaign in human history</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Uu36ekmU3U?t=199\">A campaign that took advantage of the extremely patriarchal middle eastern culture to scare and shame women into wearing the veil</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Because of this deplorable campaign...</h1>\n\n<p>Today, +300 million women all over the world wear veils, protected from experiencing a cool breeze through their hair, because they don’t want to be perceived as “prostitutes” and “sluts” but as good Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you know the true face behind the hijab, the real story behind it, I hope you understand my frustration when I see anyone fighting for the hijab and not actually reading and digging in to see how the hijab came to be.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Uu36ekmU3U?t=340\">Our support for the hijab means that we are not only being uncritical, but hypocritical, in that by supporting the hijab we wind up supporting one of the most destructive phenomena of our time</a>...</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon of women celebrating their chains.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for listening in to my rant</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
