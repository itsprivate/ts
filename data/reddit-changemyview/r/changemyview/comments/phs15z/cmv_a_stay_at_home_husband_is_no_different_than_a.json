However, I am constantly asked “what does my husband do for work” and when I tell them he doesn’t work, I am always barraged with either looks of concern or questions like “does it bother you that he doesn’t work?” Or similar gender biased questions that assume he’s just lazy and a leech. However, this doesn’t happen the other way around- no one bats an eye when the male is the breadwinner to a stay-at-home wife and it doesn’t seem to matter if there are kids involved. </p>\n\n<p>My job is very stressful and time consuming- I appreciate that my husband can do the cooking, cleaning, care-giving for me and our home while I’m at work. I also have higher earning potential in my line of work. My husband not working allows me to end the work day to spend time with him or doing things that I enjoy rather than switching to home-related tasks AND since we both don’t slave away at jobs and come home to share the load of housework, we can actually spend quality time together when the work day is done. Why is this notion of a stay at home husband so wildly unaccepted?</p>\n\n<p>**edit: a user asked why I’d want my mind changed about this and I want to clarify that I don’t want my mind changed, I want to understand the arguments of those trying to change my mind in society (I could re word the title, but it still has the same effect regardless).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
