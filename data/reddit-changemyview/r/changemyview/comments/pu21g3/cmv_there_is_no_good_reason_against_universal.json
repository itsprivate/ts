You go into any clinic or hospital in the country and can receive healthcare upon showing your state health card. For healthcare for low income families, they have to apply for it, or if the child is housing insecure or living in shelters, that serves as even more hurdles to receive health care. In a system where only low-income children can qualify for state funded health care, the child has to prove they are low income usually involving an application. I want to move to a system where every child upon birth will automatically receive their health care, and free at the point of care, unlimited health care until they are 18. Minimize these hurdles </li>\n<li>One could make the argument that universal health care for everyone is better. This argument won&#39;t change my view because it is out of the scope of this CMV. This CMV is basically saying &quot;at the very least, universal health care should be provided to children&quot;. Other vulnerable groups or universal health care for everyone is out of scope.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
