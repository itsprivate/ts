I partly put this down to TV constantly portraying these young, attractive, fit, successful people as eating junk food all the time and never working out. I don't consider myself a particularly naive or impressionable person so I don't consciously form my views on this from TV but over time it happens subconsciously.\n\nIt happens with most characters in TV, sitcoms especially but lets take Joey from Friends as an example. He's eating pizza constantly, he eats an entire turkey, the meal for 6 for 1 etc. He's seen to be working out once I think, immediately hurts himself and says 'why did I have to start lifting weights again?' - indicating this isn't something he normally does. Despite this he's a good looking guy and in good shape.\n\nBy contrast I'm a similar age and height/build and only after a solid year of working hard in the gym 3 times a week and eating right am I starting to look like that. (Starting point was just 20-30lb overweight). By the standards set on TV and adverts for 6 week abs etc., even after considering that those standards aren't reasonable and adjusting my targets accordingly, I was still disappointed with such a minor change. I think TV in general wildly misrepresents what lifestyle you need to lead to achieve a certain body type.\n\nI understand why they do it for TV. If someone is attractive, they are immediately more likeable. If they also like junk food and lying around on the couch, they are more relatable - making them more likeable again. I'd just like to see more shows address this, I think it's harmful for people's body image and very demotivating when they see what they perceive to be slow progress.\n\nMaybe I'm in the minority though, I've never heard anyone express this view before, I'm open to changing my mind. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: Thought of another good example after posting. Look at Jake and Terry from Brooklyn Nine Nine. Jake looks in pretty good shape but is portrayed as a guy that eats junk and never works out, in reality I'm guessing Andy Samberg is pretty careful about what he eats and probably goes for a run regularly. Terry is portrayed as a guy that just eats right and exercises whilst working a job and having a wife and kids. In reality his body type is only possible if he uses steroids and spends probably 3-4 hours a day working out - virtually impossible alongside a full time job, wife and kids.\n\nEDIT2: Maybe I didn't make myself clear because a lot of people seem to have misunderstood. I'm not asking for TV shows to show these people working out or eating healthily. I just don't want them to actively portray that they regularly to do the opposite like the Jake and Joey examples.",
