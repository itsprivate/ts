I would like to also state that I don&#39;t necessarily think the current banking system is perfect and could do with more regulations and I don&#39;t agree or like all the banks &amp; central banks practices however, I believe a centralized system is superior to a decentralized system because during times of crisis is creates greater volatility in credit and more specifically access to it.</p>\n\n<p>Pointing to the gold standard as historical evidence but prior to the great depression, recessions and bank panics were more potent and more frequent due to the lack of stability and a central authority. During the great depression countries that left the gold standard sooner exited the depression faster. Contrast Sweden and France, Sweden left the gold standard in 1931 and by 1936 its industrial sector was 14% higher than its 1929 peak. France left in 1936 and its manufacturing sector was still 26% its 1929 peak, the removal of the gold standard in FDRs new deal almost immediately had positive effects on the economy by allowing the currency to depreciate turning deflation into inflation, and started one of the most powerful economic bull runs in history. Since 1929 we have had one major financial crisis in 2008 which came nowhere near the severity of financial panics prior to the depression mainly because we had that lender of last resort. Here is a chart of all the recessions in the U.S and you can clearly see the number of recessions 92 years prior to the depression is much higher at 25 vs 14 since 1929, but also that the magnitude of these recessions prior to 1929 were far greater, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States</a></p>\n\n<p>The real problem with a decentralized system is it lacks a central authority or &quot;lender of last resort&quot; to step in when things get bad. I believe the only thing that stopped a global depression in 2020 and 2008 was the central banks around the world who stabilized the banking system by injecting liquidity and staving off a worldwide panic. With DeFi you have no such authority so when the economy inevitably goes into recession there is no central authority that can unstuck credit and allow for lending and borrowing to start again. It&#39;s much easier to deal with 30 large banks than a bunch of individual people afraid to lend because the government cant cut a check to everyone that would be large enough to convince individuals to lend and get credit flowing again. 700b goes a lot further in the hands of a handful of banks than millions of people. Also, central banks being able to control interest rates in the form of discount rates and control the monetary supply is incredibly invaluable in allowing a monetary system to adapt to any situation that presents itself. A good modern example of a country not being able to have control of its intreats rates &amp; currency is Greece, after the GFC Greece was a very weak country economically while other European countries had recovered quite well, this disconnect was very damaging to Greece&#39;s economy because they weren&#39;t able to create inflation and change their own interests rates to adapt to the economic situation it was in.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I mention developed countries in my title is that I do think DeFi is a reasonable alternative in countries with a broken or untrustworthy banking system think Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Iraq, lybia, etc. I also think it could be useful to allow for transactions the banking system can&#39;t and won&#39;t touch, sending funds to someone in Afghanistan for example, however, I really don&#39;t see the need for DeFi in developed countries like the US, EU, UK, Japan, etc. Again I don&#39;t think the current banking system is perfect and could definitely use more regulations and some tweaks, but using historical evidence we can see that a decentralized system has historically caused more economic instability due to the lack of a central figure in times of crisis and lack of flexibility monetary policy has to adapt to its environment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
