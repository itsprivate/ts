But Conservatives often complain that people these days are too sensitive but in reality they are the ones that are so unwilling to change that they are offended by the very idea of it. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by looking at covid. The way some conservatives act like being asked to wear a mask is oppressive is ridiculous. Is it at times inconvenient and annoying? Sure. Is it worth throwing violent fits over and protests in the streets about? No. Masks are not harming people. At worst it’s a temporary inconvenience. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at the pronoun debate. Why do these people care so intensely what pronouns someone uses. Even if you think it’s ridiculous it doesn’t hurt you to use someone’s preferred pronouns but it’s proven to improve the mental health of gender queer people. </p>\n\n<p>Recasting movies with more diversity. There’s been uproar over a black little mermaid, a Latina Snow White, a gay Superman, a female 007, but at the end of the day why does that matter? It’s not hurting anyone to have more representation but it is exciting for the people getting that onscreen representation. </p>\n\n<p>People are outraged by the move to rename Columbus Day as indigenous peoples day but why? It doesn’t hurt anyone to do this but it does make indigenous people feel better to not have to celebrate a holiday around someone that contributed to the genocide of their people. </p>\n\n<p>There is a very real push right now to not teach complete or accurate history. Not talking about how terrible slavery was or the problems in reconstruction or Japanese internment or any of the other bad things the US as done? Why? It doesn’t hurt us to acknowledge our past mistakes. We should be teaching history accurately. </p>\n\n<p>There’s many more examples of this but I just hate this idea that people now a days are too sensitive for wanting to make changes that improve people’s lives or at a bare minimum shows more respect for people. This doesn’t show sensitivity but refusing to make these changes sure does</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
