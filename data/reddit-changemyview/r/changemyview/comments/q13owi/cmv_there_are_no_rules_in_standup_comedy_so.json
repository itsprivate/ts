Sometimes they say something sexist or racist and it isn&#39;t funny, and then they will definitely get a lot of backlash.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that you can punch down and if its funny then it&#39;s funny. People need to stop trying to police it. Comedy clubs aren&#39;t a safe space and if you need one because you&#39;re too fragile then tough titties - go somewhere else. A huge part of comedy is pushing the limits and if we start drawing lines to appease everyone then lots of great jokes will disappear.</p>\n\n<p>Now when it comes to social settings or work places, I think it can be very different. There are many people who use the guise of the comedy to clearly put someone down and it is overtly racist/sexist. &quot;Make me a sandwich&quot; etc things like that.</p>\n\n<p>What might change my mind: If an overwhelming number of minorities explain to me what I&#39;m missing when it comes to stand-up comedy specifically.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit:<br/>\nIf you think there are rules then please explain them to me.<br/>\nCan a gay person make gay jokes? What about a straight guy making gay jokes? What about bisexual guy making gay jokes?<br/>\nCan a black guy make jokes at white people? Can an Asian make jokes about black people? Can white people make a joke about black gangster culture?<br/>\nPlease help me navigate this identity politics minefield. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
