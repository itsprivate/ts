It's really very rare to meet a person who is genuinely passionate about their subject of choice...and when I do see it, I like to *really* encourage it, it's so nice to sit back for half an hour and listen to someone enthusiastically ramble on about something that interests them, and then you can ask them questions about it and watch their eyes light up a bit as they realise they have found another person that is interested, another person that *understands* their mindset.\n\nI'm 28, and I am only just starting to dip my toe's into higher education (first-year design engineering) when I tell people this the response is almost always the same... \"*are you not worried that you have left it a bit late because it will harder for you to build a career afterward?*\"...and my answer is always the same, I couldn't care less about a career, I'm not studying this subject for better job prospects, I am studying it because I genuinely love the subject, I could flip burgers for the rest of my life after this and I wouldn't really care, I don't want the money, I want the knowledge.\n\n(this is why I specified that I'm from the UK as if you don't make a certain amount you don't have to pay back your student loans, and if enough time goes by, twenty years I think, then it's completely forgiven. I could understand why an American may not be able to have the same mindset as you have to pay back the student debt as it's not forgiven)\n\nSo this brings me to the real meat and bones of my view...I think the \"*commercialisation*\" of higher education has helped to minimize something that in my opinion is actually quite nobel, and that's genuine interest and passion, as it's now sidelined in favor of money, status, and career.",
