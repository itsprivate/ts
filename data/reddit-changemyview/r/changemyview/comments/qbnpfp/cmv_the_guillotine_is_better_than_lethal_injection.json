Lethal injection is expensive, messy, inefficient, and cruel.</p>\n\n<p>Problems with lethal injection:</p>\n\n<p>-Companies do not want to sell drugs to states for executions, so new drug cocktails have to keep being made as previous drugs become unavailable. The guillotine obviously does not have this problem.</p>\n\n<p>-Lethal injection is easy to botch. A new drug cocktail might be horrendous. A high-quality vein might not be found, causing the drug to spill out and botch the execution. The sedative might not work, causing the prisoner to feel immense pain. The staff might be incompetent since most doctors would break their Hippocratic Oath and execute someone.</p>\n\n<p>How the guillotine solves these problems:</p>\n\n<p>-The guillotine does not require drug suppliers</p>\n\n<p>-The guillotine does not require trained medical professionals. While the guillotine can be botched, it is significantly harder than with lethal injection. If the blade is sharp enough and the drop height is sufficient, it is a nearly foolproof method.</p>\n\n<p>-The guillotine is almost painless. Even if there is some pain, it is nothing compared to a bad lethal injection. A guillotine execution cannot drag on like lethal injection.</p>\n\n<p>-The guillotine is also better than electrocution (has been botched many times, people have even survived it) or hanging (extremely painful suffocation death if the drop is insufficient)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
