For marijuana to be legal in SOME states but not ALL just doesn’t make sense. States are entitled to have their own laws, but my question is why? Why legalize marijuana in only some states? What is the reason it’s not legalized in all? The perception of marijuana to America is so backwards. This is a earth grown plant we are talking about. That has been proven to better the health of us in certain situations. Do I even have to bring up the fact that it’s been scientifically proven that alcohol causes more negative side affects than marijuana, but yet we can drink alcohol with no question. I’ve seen so many stories involving alcoholics, but yet we praise it with no question. Marijuana in my opinion should be legalized in all 50 states. I don’t see a problem with it. Maybe it has to do with the fact that it can be sold? Either way it goes, I think it should be legalized.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
