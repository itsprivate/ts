Sure, you can arguably make as educated of a guess as possible based on all sorts of information, but at the end of the day a share’s value is constantly at the mercy of any unforeseen event that could decimate that value at any moment.

Catering to investors over the benefit of the consumer/end user is a scale tipped completely in the wrong direction. It encourages companies to feign success and assure infinite growth in the interest of securing immediate unearned funding. \n3.\t**The consequences of trading are not limited to those taking the risk** - A business can be the livelihood of thousands of real working people with families to feed and provide for.

Does this not place the outlook of an entire workforce and their loved ones in the hands of a group of traders whose commitment only exists if there’s a buck to be made?\n\nFor these reasons, I view the entire stock market operation as a glorified casino for those with more time and money than sense. A slot machine that potentially puts people’s jobs at risk making the act of frivolous trading arguably unethical in some cases. \nI realize that an argument can be made for the contrasting positive side to some of the points I’ve mentioned (e.g. The stock market can enable a business to prosper and support families just as well as they could hurt them) **but ultimately my view is that the stock market and its effects are more negative than positive.**",
