I was considered higher functioning but it was still noticeable enough to get me referred for a diagnosis from my school. I struggled with a lot of things but mainly behavior and social skils (stimming and sensory overload too but they weren’t as prominent). I have very conservative right wing parents who despite the controversy put me in behavioral therapy and sent me to social skills camps to help condition me to not like fandoms, have age appropriate interests, control my anger, understand boundaries, etc. My parents would never make excuses for my behavior. Infact when I was getting bullied they would wonder what I was doing to put a target on my back, discipline me at home, etc. \n\nI learned. It took a while but I learned how to behave more appropriately with time. My therapist tells me I technically wouldn’t even qualify for a diagnosis now. I work, i went to school, i have a ton of friends, ive had a couple long term romantic relationships, i can handle myself, i have good hygiene etc. \n\nAnyways i ran into someone a few months ago who was in my social/behavioral group when I was 11. Lets call her Allie. Allie had more problems than me but she wasn’t the lowest functioning if that makes sense. She had poor hygiene, terrible social skills, so on and so forth. We were friends and had playdates but I remember her mom being polar opposite to mine. Allie had bit me, flipped out at my brother, and was just “inappropriate and a bad social rolemodel” as my mom had put it when she made me disown her at age 12 even though i didn’t want to because at the time she was my best and only friend. (I was livid from what I remember). \n\nAnyways when i ran into her and her mom, she literally looked and sounded the same. She ran up to me and hugged me after her mom pointed her out to me. Despite covid and everything. I talked to them for a little bit and it was very uncomfortable. Her mom is the typical hyper defensive autism mom who always made excuses for her daughter’s behavior. She took her out of the social group because she thought it was unethical. From what i got from the conversation. Allie doesn’t work, go to school, have any major responsibilities, still plays with dolls, etc. \n\nI know lots of cases like Allie’s and lots of cases like mine. Autistic people can infact be functioning members of society without it “stripping their identity and causing lifelong mental health issues”. People tend to forget that these innocent autistic children grow up to be autistic adults. And if you don’t help them from a young age they’re not going to be ready to live in this world when they need to. Their parents wont be around forever. And unless the parent wants their kid living at home until they die (which most parents dont). I am so grateful that my parents set boundaries with me super young and never let me use my autism as excuse. We are capable of learning but it’s up to the people around us to actually teach us.
