For example, any engineer or tech individual looking to find an entry level position will be met with ridiculous requirements like 2 years of experience or mastery of wide ranging topics. This is most egregious in the STEM fields. </p>\n\n<p>People like to argue that &quot;this helps make America competitive in the world stage&quot;. No, all it does is give normal Americans no opportunity for career advancement and options. For example, there is a cap on the number of med school admission in the US causing a shrotage of doctors. Solution? Hire more foreign doctors. Its actually ridiculous</p>\n\n<p>We really need to end these programs as automation continues to abolish various traditional jobs. We need to set up training camps to teach people how to code, or be a technician, draftsmen, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I would either eliminate these visa&#39;s, or if a company really needed the expertise of a foreign worker, they have to pay 50% higher than the BLS median average. There is really no reason American&#39;s cannot or should not be trained up for these positions.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: The classical high paying office/technical jobs that built up America and the middle class, are starting to feel the pains of globalization.</p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE: <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/577397-facebook-settles-with-doj-to-resolve-allegations-of-discriminating-against\">https://thehill.com/policy/technology/577397-facebook-settles-with-doj-to-resolve-allegations-of-discriminating-against</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
