People say it’s no different than working any other job such as McDonald’s but we know that’s not true. A picture of you taking someone’s order probably isn’t going to hurt your future while a picture of you naked will. You always hear about how empowering and glamorous the porn industry is but it’s always by the top paid performers which are the loudest voices, and not much about the drugs, abuse and STDs. Look at the porn industry which is legal and how much craziness is going on there. It would also just create huge contradictions about how we want our society to be. </p>\n\n<p>So I don’t think it should be legal. Still I think it should be decriminalized and sex work should not hurt the sex worker. At most I think they should be fined but also provided resources on how to leave that life and health resources too.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
