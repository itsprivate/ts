  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am very, very, very cynical about democracy&#39;s prospects in the US. Every day that passes feels like a checkmark on a countdown to the end of democracy. The defense of democracy is, to me, the single most important issue of the time, bar none. And I think that defense is... pathetic? Token? Less-than-token?</p>\n\n<p>For purposes of this CMV, I&#39;m going to limit this to the threat of Republicans overturning democracy through election subversion. It scares the heck out of me. By election subversion, I mean the ability to alter/ignore the actual vote in favor of a false, bad faith result. Don&#39;t get hung up on the semantics here. And I&#39;m not talking about voter fraud, the Republican Party&#39;s favorite excuse for implementing the very changes that so concern me. Election subversion focuses on the administration and certification of elections, and the abuse thereof.</p>\n\n<p>My perspective is based on Prof. of Law Rick Hasen&#39;s analysis; Ezra Klein&#39;s analysis; 538&#39;s continually bleak columns about the future of our democracy; Nate Cohn&#39;s analysis; the Cook Political Report and Dave Wasserman&#39;s redistricting and gerrymandering analysis; the closeness of the 2020 elections; and, above all else, the Republican and right-wing behavior in light of the Jan. 6th insurrection, its whitewashing, its bad-faith justification, and the Republican exaltation of the &quot;Big Lie,&quot; alongside Republican-led electoral law and procedural changes designed to make it easier for elections to be subverted.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, I think the Republicans will be in an excellent position to pull off election subversion and steal the presidency as soon as 2024, and that nothing meaningful has been/will be done to prevent this. Legislation that fails to pass into law does not count as &quot;meaningful&quot; in my book. I think American democracy is well and truly doomed.</p>\n\n<p>Please CMV.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have to attend to IRL matters, but will return at a later time this evening.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
