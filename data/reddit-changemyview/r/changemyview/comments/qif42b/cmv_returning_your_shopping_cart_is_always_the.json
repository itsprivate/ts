I absolutely hate it when I go to pull into a spot and someone left their cart in it. It seems to me like there’s no excuse. Parking lots are already accident prone and unreturned carts are an extra hazard. If you don’t want to walk it back into the store then don’t use it. Toddlers are taught to clean up what they take out to use. If you cannot physically return a cart you can notify a staff member and they will assist you. Often times they’ll offer before you even need to ask. Leaving it on the curb is a d*ck move; and a red flag for me when I make friends/consider partners. The only “valid” explanation I consider for leaving a cart in a parking spot is that you’re either lazy, inconsiderate, or both.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
