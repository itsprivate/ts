  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m in college debate and just moved on to uni where it&#39;s aggressively liberal. One of the things I&#39;ve already been yelled at for is referring to homeless people as such. They want me to say unhouse individuals or people without housing. Which I found very semantic and nit-picky. The stated reason I&#39;ve been told is &quot;It shifts the terminology from them being people that have homelessness tied to their identity to people experiencing something.&quot; That along with the idea that being called homeless borders on a slur. Both reasons I found to be... unsubstantial to say the least. </p>\n\n<p>The first point while sounds like it make sense to me feels toothless. Like yay, you changed some language technicalities. But does that actually make people want to fix homelessness? I don&#39;t think so. If anything seems like a way people who don&#39;t have the means or desire to truly help attempt to add their &quot;help&quot;. It becomes virtue signaling rather than actual help. </p>\n\n<p>The second point, of it being a &quot;slur&quot;, is just moving the goal post honestly. To be fair I don&#39;t even see it as a slur, its a functional term that like many words does carry some stigma which would move to any other word that described this idea. This takes me to the idea that it&#39;s moving the goal post, similarly to how we stopped using the word hobo, how homeless is being seen as the &quot;bad word&quot; give it some time and now unhoused person or person without housing will become the new bad word that needs to be changed. Being homeless is an unfortunate position and as long as American homelessness stays as it is will always be seen with stigma, thus any change in name will just shift the stigma to that new name. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now how it becomes harmful, by changing the name to such a sterile terminology. While in the future will become a slur as bad as homelessness (which honestly isn&#39;t even a slur) in the now becomes so sterile as to no longer elicited emotion and make the problem harder for the average joe and jane to feel. Like, tell someone &quot;The plane is experiencing significantly reduced lift&quot; vs &quot;Oh the plane of falling out of the sky&quot; which one of those is gonna make someone go &quot;Oh shit a problem&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Changing the terminology is just moving a goal post while sterilizing a word to garner no emotional value, thus as at best becomes virtue signaling with no benefit and at worse making the homeless seem like an abstract city problem</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
