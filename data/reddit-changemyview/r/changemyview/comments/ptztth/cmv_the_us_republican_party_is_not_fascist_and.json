We are 3 years away from a Republican-led government.  If we were experiencing transfers of power from a Fascist party, or to a Communist party, the amount of things that would be radically different than the way they were before the transfer of power would be causing society-wide whiplash; there would be chaos.    </p>\n\n<p>People are who they say they are.  People don&#39;t go into politics with a &quot;pretend&quot; ideology and a &quot;real&quot; ideology that they secretly believe.  Even if they did, it doesn&#39;t matter; they don&#39;t govern the way that their supposed &quot;real&quot; ideology would dictate.  We still have capitalism, we still have democracy, and we&#39;ve had it through both Democrat and Republican administrations.  Both Republicans and Democrats are more or less liberals: Republicans leaning towards so-called Classical Liberalism and Democrats towards so-called Social Liberalism; a right leaning liberalism or a left leaning one.  There are wings of both parties that are more extreme, sure.  Doesn&#39;t change the broad outlook of the majority of members of both parties, and those &quot;extreme&quot; wings are still far off from being openly fascist or communist.  </p>\n\n<p>If somehow you can prove that either party has at least some fascist or communist elements, then you&#39;d change my mind.  I&#39;m expecting both sides to be trying to litigate what exactly communism and fascism mean, so maybe if you can give me a better definition than the ones that I think are warranted, you could change my mind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
