Don&#39;t get me wrong, both receive a lot of unnecessary hate and also good support from both sexes, but from overhearing conversations heard in a high school, being gay is prone to bullying far more than being a lesbian. Many girls i know are lesbians, and ive yet to hear one person complain about lesbians(except for extreme cases like a 500+ pound woman making large scenes for no reason). Gay people however, even though i dont know a single one in our school, get so much hate and are made fun of constantly. Its consistently used in a bad manor and as an insult that nobody wants to be. &quot;If this goes in your gay!&quot; Or &quot;Your literally so gay bro shut up&quot; are just ones ive heard today. I cant even imagine what thats like for anyone in the lgbt community to hear, let alone a gay guy being used as the butt of a joke or the threat of a statement made. Once again i should state that this happens to girls as well, but the difference in usage is dramatic. Is this just me and is it me just being selective? Because i feel like it just isnt the same at all. Would love feedback.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
