It basically gives corporations unlimited political influence. We are seeing this play out on social media very clearly.

This creates legislation that benefits megacorporations instead of the working class. \n\nThen there's net neutrality. Republicans voted to get rid of it. Democrats wanted it. Net neutrality would mean the internet is treated like a utility and no particular traffic can be unequally or unfairly controlled. Let's say Verizon is your internet provider, and Verizon leadership is super liberal. Without net neutrality, Verizon can charge users extra for them to access conservative media.
