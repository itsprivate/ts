The rich - at all times - resent being governed at all.</p>\n\n<p>The last time this country didn&#39;t suck for working people, the top tax rates were in the 80%-90% range (1940s and 1950s). No rich people went hungry or bankrupt, and very few businesses failed. Rich people today dodge billions in taxes and spend a fraction of what they <em>should</em> pay in tax to launder their reputations with charity (PR) and lobby elected officials to make sure nothing of consequence ever changes in a way they don&#39;t approve of. Some of you might even look up to them. You shouldn&#39;t. Today, union participation is at an all-time low and the wealth gap is at an all time high. Every 8 to 15 years, capitalism collapses and rich people&#39;s companies get bailed out (especially financial institutions) while the common people get crushed. When the economy rebounds, bonuses for the bosses flow while you&#39;re looked at as an ungrateful wretch for asking why the minimum wage hasn&#39;t moved off $7.25 an hour since 2009.</p>\n\n<p>You, non-rich person with a job, are governed by <em>them</em>. <strong>You are not free</strong>. At any time, a health emergency can bankrupt you and possibly make you homeless. At any time, you can be fired from your job and given a pittance of unemployment to survive off until you find another job (your employer will likely fight you on this). Housing, food, gas, and college all increase in cost faster than wages increase. If minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be $24-$25 an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Go listen to Franklin Roosevelt talk about how a business that doesn&#39;t pay a living wage has no right to exist. Listen to him talk about &quot;the economic royalists&quot;. Listen to his 2nd inauguration in 1936 where he said &quot;I should like to have it said of my first Administration that in it the  forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. I should  like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces  met their master.&quot; Then ask yourself how we got from there to here. It&#39;s because the folksy avatar of rich people took over the presidency in 1981 (top tax rate in 1981 = 70%; top tax rate in 1989 = 28%) and it&#39;s been progressively shitty for working people ever since.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR = it&#39;s been 40 years of failure, unless you&#39;re a rich person, in which case this is the best of all possible worlds.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I know the New Deal primarily helped white people and FDR interned Japanese people in WW2. This is not a hagiography of what is (still) our best president to date, and I know he was a flawed man. He was also the last leader in this country to be a class traitor in a good way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
