When I do have to go back to live TV for whatever reason, the ad breaks are so disruptive.  Not just taking the time away from the show, but commercials have different volume levels, different art styles, different everything! From the other commercials as well as the show.</p>\n\n<p>For example: I’d way rather have a moment in a show where the main character has a 30 second car ride up a long driveway to walk up to the front door of a secondary character. Basically a car commercial with a bunch of glamour shots of a shiny car with a handsome driver. At least the sound design, and the direction, would fit with the rest of the show. Main character knocks on the door and we hit the ground running with the episode. Maybe they go inside and there are Heinekens on the table. Who cares? We’re in the universe of the show!</p>\n\n<p>Things that would change my mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a strong financial argument that product placement things simply aren’t lucrative enough</p></li>\n<li><p>a slippery slope type argument that the line between art and commercialism would be blurred even further to the point of being indistinguishable</p></li>\n<li><p>a full throated defense of commercials I guess? I’m not taking this so seriously, whatever ya got!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
