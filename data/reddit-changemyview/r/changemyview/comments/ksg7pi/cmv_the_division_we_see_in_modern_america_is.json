  "selftext": "Joe Biden has just been elected as the 46th president of the United States. He has promised unity to a broken America; an America that is polarized between two camps that are becoming more and more divisive and filled with vitriol. I firmly believe that we are on the brink of an important inflection point in American history that could impact not only my life, but the lives of my children.\n\nIn order for Joe to fix this growing schism, I think he needs to take action. But what is the cause of our problem? Well, many would point to Donald Trump and incumbent Republicans spreading misinformation and hawkish remarks and pushing Americans apart. Now, I do think that this is a huge and continuing problem, but getting rid of the stems of a weed will not solve our weed problem. Donald Trump is merely an elected official pushed into power by his constituents. As many have said, Trump is a symptom of a much bigger virus that is infecting America. We have to get to the roots.\n\nThe problem we face (in my opinion) is 100% the Media that we subject ourselves to. I'm not blaming only social media, but television and textual news media as well. I'll break it down into cause and effect starting with the news in the 1970s-80s. In the 80s, the barrier between News and Entertainment eroded. Tabloid media became popular and \"news\" became about ad revenue. Thus, viewership became a necessity for any surviving network. Well, how do you attract and hold the attention of viewers? You make it more entertaining and dramatic. Drama, going back to the Greeks, needs characters. These characters are always caricatures of character traits. This is done so that the Author can easily portray motive and themes to the audience and keep the audience engaged in the story. Well, the news that was supposed to always be boring and factual now uses the dramatic characterization used by Ancienct Greeks, Shakespeare and Quentin Tarantino to build caricatures of REAL PEOPLE so that they can increase ratings and sell more ad spots.\n\nThe consequences of this shift is now realized in our daily lives. We ONLY see 2-dimensional caracatures of people on the news and in our twitter feeds. Republicans are shown the screaming and rioting illustrations of social-justic warriors who threaten many American's known way of life and small businesses. Democrats are shown the racist, sexist, and conspiracy riddled QAnon follower who challenges our liberty and future. And we eat this shit up. These views are not held by most of our political opponents. Most Americans are centrists and moderates. Most people are boring. But because we get off to outrage, we are constantly fed images of the cartoon villains that we want to exist and we want to defeat. This will ultimately lead to violence and possibly our downfall.\n\nWe now believe the actions of the minorities represent the majority. We believe this because that is what is shown to us everyday, all day by the media. We believe this because our friends and family believe this. How do we differentiate the ground Truth from the media portrayed \"Truth\". Well, I'm not a politician. Hopefully the people now in power can answer these questions for the sake of all Americans.\n\nI apologize for this rant but I have been thinking about it for a while and needed to get it off my chest. This is also done on my phone so I apologize for the formatting and spelling. Please feel free to CMV!",
