This is mainly in the realm of media for me - think Disney “You like marvel movies? - here’s a new one pay this premium price to see the new one.”, new games, “like Pokémon? Make sure you buy the newest games to get the latest and greatest” etc. Of course you can always choose to not buy into the hype. Get the show or game later. But then -</p>\n\n<p>Social media - perhaps just media in general - there seems to be a trend to me - of constant posts/ memes etc on all accounts relating to these newest shows/games etc. If you’re not with latest - you’re kind of “excluded” because your not in the loop. I know that a lot of these posts etc may be sponsored content or viral marketing - but that paired with adverts etc can cause a feeling of exclusion within society (or at least your bubble)</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this is advertising - just in general - isn’t the base aim of an advert to make you feel like you’re lacking or not enough - and you should buy this product to feel better. Be it something to make you look better or feel better - or try this limited edition whatever (the base idea of a limited edition anything is to create scarcity and cause fear that you will miss out to induce a purchase). Every food company has limited edition flavours - shoes have limited edition sneakers - every product category I can think of does this - and it can all kind of culminate - </p>\n\n<p>If something gives you pleasure - the company behind it will always try to find a way to milk your happiness for money - and with the advent of subscription services this is feeling almost like a literal milking sometimes. Do you like Mario? Prove it. Buy the Mario shirt - and cereal - see the movie - get the limited edition Mario branded console and don’t forget you like Levis jeans and Mario and Levi’s are now doing a limited edition collab - you might miss out. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Everything in my life feels soured and tainted by advertising and capitalism. I no longer can find any way to enjoy things because there’s a cynical advertising executive in my head who points out all the ways I’m being marketed to and to like or enjoy something is just giving companies a new way to exploit you. Please try and change my view if only for my ability to find pleasure in something again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
