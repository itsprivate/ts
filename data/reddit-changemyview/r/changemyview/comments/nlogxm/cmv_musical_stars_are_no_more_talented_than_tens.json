There are extreme cases like Bob Dylan, who can hardly sing at all, but more generally I don't find anything impressive about the musical talents of the average musician you hear on the radio.  I've often heard random people singing in coffee shops or college a capella groups who can do a better job musically with the same songs.\n\nI'd contrast this to the situation with professional sports.  Take, say, Olympic sprinters.  These are the fastest people in the world.  There's close to no chance that someone who didn't qualify for the Olympics (unless they were thrown out for drugs or something) could possibly beat the Olympic champion, who really is the \"fastest man in the world\" at that point of time.  Or take the NBA.  The 500 or so people currently on NBA rosters are a pretty good approximation of the 500 best basketball players in the world.  I'm sure there are some who would be swapped in an objective ranking, but you'd end up with a pretty similar talent pool.\n\nOn the other hand, if you selected the 500 most successful musicians in the world right now (e.g., most sales or something) and you objectively selected the 500 most talented musicians, I doubt there would be much if any overlap.  Instead of talent, success as a musician has a lot to do with luck, branding, appearance, etc.\n\nJust to be clear, I think your average star is a lot more musically talented than a random person on the street.   Most of them are probably at the 90th percentile of musical talent or better.  But my point is that the average star doesn't seem to have more talent than tens of thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of people who sing in a capella group, play in a wedding band, or do gigs in front of 14 people at a coffee shop.\n\nAdmittedly this is all subjective, but you can change my view by convincing me that musical stars actually are uniquely talented on not just fairly good musicians who succeeded on the basis of other attributes.\n\nEdit: To put this a slightly different way, I'm saying that if we selected the best musicians by blind audition, essentially none of the most popular musicians today would make the cut.  On the other hand, if we selected Olympic sprinters blind, we'd end up with the same people.\n\nEdit to Clarify: By talented, I mean \"musically talented.\"",
