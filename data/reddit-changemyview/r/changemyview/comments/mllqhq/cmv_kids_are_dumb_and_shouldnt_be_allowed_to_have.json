You want to swap your wardrobe to look more feminine, undergo gender reassignment surgery, take pills to cause your chemical makeup to match that of your preferred gender, go on ahead.\n\nKids are stupid, I was one once. There were tattoos I wanted and ways I dressed up as that I think are stupid today. Now I do see the argument that those are different than gender. Yes I do understand that some people are born intersex, and this post isn't about them. There's been several cases of people who began the transition to another gender only to later reverse that decision and have physical traits that cannot be reversed as easily. I can't recall her channel but there's a woman who was FtM at one point in her teens and underwent some chemical therapies to begin the process but has since realized she's not transgender. Now her voice is that of a man's and people think she's a MtF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also should note that I'm not fully aware of all that is in the Arkansas bill that is currently in the news, but based on how CNN describes it,  it would've prohibited physicians in the state from providing gender-affirming \"procedures\" for trans people under age 18, I see no reason why I should be against it. People keep saying that this means that this will lead to more trans kids dying, that they're denying healthcare to trans kids, etc. I see all of these comments as a massive overreaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR So change my view that I think that kids (under 18) shouldn't be allowed to undergo surgical or chemical procedures to change their genders even with parental consent. Exceptions being to verified intersex individuals. If a non-intersex kid wants to be recognized as the opposite gender I have no problem with that.",
