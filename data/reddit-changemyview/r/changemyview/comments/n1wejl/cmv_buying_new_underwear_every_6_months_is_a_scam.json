I looked it up and found that there is some articles and statements that support his claim but when I actually look into it, the reasoning is always bacterial build up which can lead to a UTI. While, sure a bacterial build up CAN do this, you COULD also just wash your flipping body and your clothing. Hygiene is the prevention of disease through cleanliness so as long as you&#39;re bathing and doing laundry, you won&#39;t get the aforementioned UTI which would heavily imply that the hygienics of the situation have nothing to do with how long you&#39;ve had those dinosaur-print tighty-whiteys.</p>\n\n<p>With this said you should TOTALLY get new undies every now and then. Maybe cycle them out when they&#39;re worn or whatever but having a set once-a-year timing is just silly and I believe it to be a part of Big Undies&#39; agenda to sell more undies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
