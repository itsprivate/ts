I’m not sure how many I will find on Reddit, though. </p>\n\n<p>I want to start by saying that I’m not an atheist and I’m actually very much interested in religion in general, but one thing I cannot accept about Christianity is the notion that people who do not accept Christ as their savior spend eternity in hell. </p>\n\n<p>Christians will often state that God’s love is unconditional and site John 3:16 as the source. Let’s have a look:</p>\n\n<p><em>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is not unconditional love. The condition is very clear. We must believe in one particular version of God. Unconditional love means loving someone despite any wrongdoing. Mere mortals are fundamentally flawed but able to forgive people for all kinds of things. People forgive infidelity, theft, even murder. It’s not easy for sure, but it happens. If people can do it, why can’t a perfect being? </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I have never really understood the idea of “gave His one and only Son”. He sent His Son, who is actually part of God in the first place, to the world for 33 years. Then He died in what is surely a very horrible way, but, let’s be honest, many people have been tortured to death. And, according to the Christian Bible many of those same people then had their everlasting souls cast into never ending agony because they did not believe in the Christian God. Christ was eternal in the first place. So, was 33 years really such a sacrifice? I’m not trying to be disrespectful. It just doesn’t make sense to me. </p>\n\n<p>I want to say, that I am comfortable with the idea of a Creator being who is not loving and sends people to hell because He’s kind of a sadist. I see no reason to believe that this is not true. I’m also comfortable with the idea that God grants eternal life to people who believe in Him and everyone else just slips into nothingness. That also makes sense, I guess. But, I can’t wrap my head around the idea of a loving God who casts people into an eternity of suffering. </p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry but that does not make any kind of sense to me. Change my view, please.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
