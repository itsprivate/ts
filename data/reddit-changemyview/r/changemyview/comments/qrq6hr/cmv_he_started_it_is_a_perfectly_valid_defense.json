This is a horrible thing to teach kids, it basically says if someone is bullying/assaulting/annoying you, you are not allowed to do anything to defend yourself or retaliate you just have to sit there and take it (until presumably you snap and shoot up a school).</p>\n\n<p>In actual law the person who started it committed assault or attempted murder and the person who is defending themselves committed no crime even if they kill them. When it comes to kids the stakes are a lot lower so it&#39;s easy to brush off the whole thing and tell them both to shut up but while that might be convenient for the adult it&#39;s very damaging for the children, because the aggressor is taught they can get anyone they want in trouble by aggressing on them and will face no more than equal consequences and might even be able to use that to extort people and like I said before the defender is taught that they should never fight back or retaliate. So instead of teaching kids that it matters who started it and thus you should never aggress on someone as they are justified in retaliating we teach them never to retaliate enabling the aggressors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
