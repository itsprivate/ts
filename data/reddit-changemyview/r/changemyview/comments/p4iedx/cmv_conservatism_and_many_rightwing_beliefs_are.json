  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>By fear I mean all the fear-mongering rhetoric right-wing speakers use to present an idea. It&#39;s always in opposition to something, always presented as a defense of our values which the left, blacks, jews or any other minority want to &quot;take away&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>By primary instincts, I mean judging and making judgement on your first reaction and little to nothing more than that. As in, assuming the point someone you disagree with is irrelevant, because they&#39;re physically unattractive. Or assuming you&#39;re right, because none of the people around you challenge your views or, furthermore, enable you and each other in it</p>\n\n<p>By lack of understanding, I mean a lack of insight to where the other person is coming from or seeing the flaws in your own logic. Is your racism based in logic or your fears?</p>\n\n<p>I talked to many right-wingers, whether it be in real life or online. It always goes south. I always try to remain composed, I put extra effort in to not be mean, snarky, etc. But the tension is just fueled by the right-wingers I talk to, often using non-sense language like soy, cringe, redpilled and such. I don&#39;t even feel like I&#39;m discussing, I feel like I&#39;m throwing punches with a mumbling primate that sometimes kinda sounds like it says words</p>\n\n<p>I also feel (not much evidence to back that up), that conservatives don&#39;t like their views challenged. Like conservative subreddits won&#39;t allow you to comment if you don&#39;t have a flair given by the mod. Or they will just throw out their buzzwords and call you a communist snowflake. Honestly it feels like self-harm at this point</p>\n\n<p>edit: Yep, I was needlessly aggressive. I see that. But I&#39;m not editing it out, to not pretend like that didn&#39;t happen. Call that character development. Thanks for your patience regardless of that</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
