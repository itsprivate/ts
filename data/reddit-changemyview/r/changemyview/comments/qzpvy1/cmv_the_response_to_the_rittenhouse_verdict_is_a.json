  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As a longtime proponent and donor to Criminal Justice Reform initiatives, I am extremely distraught by the reaction to the verdict by so called &quot;liberals&quot; who spent much of last year praising BLM protests and have, at times, done some actual good work in terms of criminal justice (<a href=\"https://campaignzero.org/#research\">Campaign Zero</a>, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Many extremely prominent individuals and organizations have made it clear that much like their (usually right-wing) opponents, they do not care about accused individuals who do not line up with their politics or aren the wrong race. Similar to free speech, the concept of criminal justice needs to be politically agnostic. There should be no political prosecutions in this country. </p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/19/statement-by-president-biden/\">President</a>, to the <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-kamala-harris-denounces-rittenhouse-verdict-says-clearly-theres-a-lot-more-work-to-do/\">VP</a>,  to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1461762952567136259\">ACLU</a> of all places, prominent people who say they are proponents of Criminal Justice Reform have not only spouted misinformation about the facts of the case, but have objected to a decision made by a jury of fellow citizens, an extremely dangerous president to set. They&#39;ve made it clear that they would have preferred Rittenhouse be found guilty of murder without any real explanation of their stance outside of objecting with how it made them feel.</p>\n\n<p>This is in no way condoning the valorization of Rittenhouse by the right, but the left has been entirely unprincipled in this extremely important area of governance and their hypocrisy has hurt the overall cause. <strong>If you&#39;re unwilling to support people you do no like, you don&#39;t actually care about a principle.</strong></p>\n\n<p>CMV!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
