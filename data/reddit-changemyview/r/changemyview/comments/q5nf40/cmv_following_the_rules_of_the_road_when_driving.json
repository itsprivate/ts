It’s your turn! Don’t wave at me to go first! </li>\n<li>I was exiting a parking lot today turning onto a major road in town where the speed limit is 45mph. I need to wait till it’s clear before I pull my car into traffic. Apparently not. The car already on the road stopped and let me leave the parking lot. There was nobody behind him. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Being a predictable driver makes the roads safer. Rant over.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
