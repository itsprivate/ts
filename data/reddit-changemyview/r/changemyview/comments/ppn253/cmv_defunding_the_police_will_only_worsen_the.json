  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First things first:\n- Not saying we shouldn&#39;t fund mental health services. We absolutely should.\n- Not saying police should be allowed to buy all the military toys. We fund them so obviously we can decide what they&#39;re allowed to buy and use.\n- Not saying we should reward the bad behavior and simply pay the bad officers more. But we simply can&#39;t expect better cops for less pay.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, policing is bad because we didn&#39;t hire and train well. Had we hired and trained well, we wouldn&#39;t have this problem. We don&#39;t have a problem of overly-qualified and too well-trained cops becoming malicious overlords. We have cops who no other career opportunities, no interest in public safety, no ethics. This isn&#39;t a result of overpaying them, so we can&#39;t solve it by defunding.</p>\n\n<p>A similarly wrong approach was cutting the funding to schools that didn&#39;t perform well. It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see that the school that has less funding will do even worse now.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, if we want good policing, we have to pay cops more, spend more on their training, and probably hire more of them so they have a work-life balance and good mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\n- To prevent bikeshedding and getting around solving the biggest policing problem I&#39;ll provide an example: How do we have cops that don&#39;t botch a raid and kill an innocent neighbor with less funding? How does less funding achieve that?\n- Yes, sometimes cops fail to handle a mental health crisis but the vast majority of police harm happens when they respond to a call about violence or potential violence or drug offenses. These are squarely police duties, globally. Defunding can&#39;t help prevent police incompetence and violence and prevent future Breonna Taylor incidents.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2:\n- A little shocked that commends indicate our takeaways from the summer of 2020 was &quot;let&#39;s get social workers to handle mental health calls&quot;. I fail to see how that would&#39;ve prevented George Floyd&#39;s killing, literally the incident that started the &quot;defund the police&quot; movement.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
