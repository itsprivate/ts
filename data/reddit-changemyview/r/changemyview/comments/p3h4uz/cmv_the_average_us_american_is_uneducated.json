But the objective reality is that the average American person lacks a basic critical understanding of history, politics, geography, physical and natural sciences, philosophy, and language.</p>\n\n<p>I was visiting my mom&#39;s house (long trip from her basement, because that&#39;s where all we redditors live) where she has French TV channels. On the regular TV channel during prime-time hours, they were having an in depth discussion with a prominent contemporary French philosopher. The dialogue was far reaching and analytical, and the audience was rapt. They brought on other public intellectuals and engaged in a debate. It wasn&#39;t entertaining in the American sense of sensationalism, yelling, and wild attacks that we are used to during such discussions on TV, and the language being used was decently sophisticated. It was eye-opening to see how this was on prime-time regular TV.</p>\n\n<p>Next I watched the newscast and was floored to see comprehensive reporting and foreign correspondents covering a wide range of current events. </p>\n\n<p>During the intermission, they had a brief section on the etymology of a French word. I doubt most Americans even know what etymology is!   </p>\n\n<p>Finally I saw some interviews with French politicians and the media, and holy crap, American politicians would melt under that pressure and scrutiny. They didn&#39;t let them weasel out of anything with hard-hitting follow-up questions. I could only imagine how the White House press conferences would unfold with such questioning.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I saw that French TV was for an audience of adults, while American TV is for an audience at the intellectual level of tweens.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t mean for this to sound like pretentious BS, because it was honestly startling and alarming how dumbed down we&#39;ve become in this country. We should be at their level, but we&#39;re not.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, it is a big stretch to go from watching an evening of foreign TV and making large assumptions about the general population, but it was telling. Americans are poorly educated, and are either proud or ignorant of the fact that they are so far behind the rest of the world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
