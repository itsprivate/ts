It&#39;s what everyone forces on you when you probably become 5 and if you don&#39;t wear it, then expect to be sexually harassed or even killed and murdered and raped(And no one will even support you nor punish the rapist according to the Islamic law)</p>\n\n<p>No. You don&#39;t have a choice to leave the religion. You leave it, you are killed or heavily harassed that you may as well suicide(Actually the real punishment is death but if you&#39;re lucky to live in less strict societies then you might be harassed instead)</p>\n\n<p>No. Muslims don&#39;t love gays. They would murder them in cold blood.</p>\n\n<p>No. Muslims don&#39;t love and all adorable toward western people nor Jews. Most of them support Hitler for holocaust and killing them, plus they hate the west because of their &quot;dirty&quot; and &quot;filthy&quot; values. You will rarely find anyone loving the western people, they would rather kill them.</p>\n\n<p>No. Women don&#39;t have their rights nor it&#39;s their culture. A lot(If not most) women here get beaten and hit by their husbands, marital raped(Because this is allowed) and regarded as sub-species worse than anybody. Not to mention the disgusting pedophilia phenomena that is happening in all of Islamic countries where grown men marry 14-15 year old girls and even incest(It&#39;s okay to marry your cousin. My 15 year old cousin is literally getting married to my other 33 year old cousin this year, my parents themselves are cousins) and no one will do anything about it because it&#39;s the norm here. Women can&#39;t even leave their houses without a male relative to accompany them.</p>\n\n<p>Imams are not peaceful nor calm nor understanding, they can be extremely aggressive in a lot of issues.</p>\n\n<p>Children getting physically and mentally abused and controlled by their parents even when they&#39;re grown.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of disgusting stuff and terrorism happening to all groups of people(Non-religious, women, Jews, homosexual...etc) in most of Islamic states and no one cares when you mention it because the left-wing made everyone think this is the real Islam and Muslim and that this is their &quot;culture&quot; so it&#39;s normal and the worst is that these people rarely get punished because the law is Islamic sharia so they will be seen as fighting for Islam. Heck, if my parents or someone I know sees what I&#39;m writing right now, I&#39;m going to probably be killed for it.</p>\n\n<p>It is not. There are more and more but I don&#39;t want to make it too long to read. Everything I wrote here has an Islamic proof so if anyone wants to argue, I will happily bring you proof.</p>\n\n<p>Change my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Even though I&#39;m talking about protecting women too much, I&#39;m actually a male(But I still support all of the Islam affected oppressed groups even if I have advantage in the religion because of my gender)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I made a mistake making this post. I was stupid to think I could make western people understand what ex-Muslims are living in Islamic nations. When you were given a choice and support, we were given a Quran to read and Hijab to wear and a knife if we refuse. So different it&#39;s impossible to understand. I&#39;m giving up. You will never understand.</p>\n\n<p>People will call me a teenage edgelord, I don&#39;t care.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: We literally study about the Islamic sharia in School. We have a subject lasting 12 years of our lives(From Elementary to High School) called &quot;Islam raising&quot; and all what I said is being studied which means there is no way to reach Muslims because they themselves get brainwashed at such a young age since they were born by the government and school themselves.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 3: Liberal Muslims are not Muslims. Muslims who go drink Alcohol, date around with no Hijab are not Muslims by any level, not strict and not moderate. Not even Muslims consider them Muslims, they are usually calling them hypocrites and kuffars. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
