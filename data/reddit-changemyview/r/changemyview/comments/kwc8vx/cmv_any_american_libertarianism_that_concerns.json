  "selftext": "In modern economically liberal democracies, for-profit corporations often have far more direct and unchallenged authoritarian power over all aspects of human life than government agencies. Their success in capturing government regulatory power through lobbying and corruption in the past several decades in for example the U.S. demonstrates one of the weaknesses of government, while at the same time actually also showing that robust government (or some equivalent organized and sovereign counterweight to corporate power) is the only thing that really stands a chance of counterbalancing this corporate power. In other words -- that they are spending so much money to undermine it and capture it demonstrates that they understand it is the most credible threat and obstacle to their absolute control.\n\nThe character of corporate and government power is of course different, and it is probably useless to debate which has the potential to be \"more\" or \"less\" oppressive. Governments have, can, and do engage in a wide variety of oppressive behavior which can directly impinge upon and degrade human liberty, safety, health, and quality of life. There is no question about that. There is also really no question that corporations also have, can, and do engage in a wide variety of oppressive behavior which can directly impinge upon and degrade human liberty, safety, health, and quality of life. Neither of these statements should be taken as an argument that both governments and corporations haven't also produced a wide variety of benefits, which of course they have.\n\nNonetheless, the historical movements (particularly in the Western World) which have aimed to democratize government power, limit it, and distribute it more fairly among the population it impacts have seen a reasonable amount of (of course, imperfect) success. By comparison, equivalent historical movements to democratize business power, limit it, and distribute it more fairly among the population it impacts have seen much less success, particularly in the U.S. Within their respective organizations, C-level corporate leaders and members of boards have far more authoritarian and undemocratic power than presidents, prime ministers, or members of Congresses, Parliaments, or Diets -- even with labor unions, but especially without them.\n\nModern life is increasingly impacted by the actions of massive business interests, and it seems like every year there is less and less room to live life as a human being at all meaningfully outside of their far-reaching influence. Corporations can poison the air and water, dictate laws to local and national government, track citizens and monitor their speech and behavior, imprison people, create wealth and poverty, and dictate norms of speech, thought, behavior, dress, appearance, and lifestyle which they can then enforce through powerful economic incentives and disincentives which there are increasingly fewer and fewer alternatives to and fewer and fewer meaningful ways to escape from. And they are not anywhere near as subject to self-regulation by their stakeholders and the people affected by their actions and decisions as governments often are.\n\nBelow a certain threshold of power, or with a more limited reach, this might not be cause for concern. But we are at least decades past those thresholds. Corporate power over its domains is nearly absolutely, completely authoritarian in character, and has the ability to destroy the lives of anyone who opposes it (and excommunicate any stakeholder within it who attempts to organize against it) unilaterally and without the faintest lip service toward due process or checks and balances, in a way that most Western government power simply doesn't even come close.\n\nAlso, in terms of championing \"liberty\" as a political and social ideology, let's acknowledge the obvious: if I am imprisoned, I'm not any freer if the people imprisoning me are a \"private\" corporation than if they're the government.\n\nAs a result, I've always found the focus of so many people who call themselves \"Libertarian\" on government power to be misguided at best, or disingenuous at worse. In fact, I think the reason that \"small government\" and \"limited government power\" are so squarely in the center of the American Overton window at the moment is directly a product of the influence of corporate power in steering the conversation. We know that small, weakened government is good for the interests of large corporations (except for when it needs to them to bail them out financially or send troops to protect or enforce their interests), so it seems to be that we ought to be a lot more suspicious of any supposed \"Libertarianism\" that wants to talk entirely about government power and not about any other kind of power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - For the last several decades, corporate business power has been a far bigger threat to human liberty, freedom, health, and quality of life than government power. Anyone who calls themselves a \"Libertarian\" needs to concern themselves with it and be talking about how to resolve the issue of the need for a counterbalance to it if not government. Any self-styled \"Libertarian\" who just wants to talk about government power despite the bigger elephant in the room isn't really concerned with human liberty as their main focus, and need to be called out to be more honest about whatever their real ideology is.",
