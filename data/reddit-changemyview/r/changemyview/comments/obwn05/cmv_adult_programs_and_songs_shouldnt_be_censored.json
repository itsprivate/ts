  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Corporations shouldn&#39;t have to parent your child. You are their parent and it is your responsibility to raise them. If you don&#39;t want your kids to see or hear a programming then that should be on you. When I hear a song on the radio with 50 different little distorted parts it makes me laugh. If it&#39;s so inappropriate why is it on a channel meant for all audiences? If it&#39;s so inappropriate why let your child listen to begin with? Do you really think the swear words are the only controversial thing in these songs? Why not simply parent your child and make sure they aren&#39;t consuming content you don&#39;t see fit for your child?</p>\n\n<p>It also ruins songs and programs for us adults. There have been parts that are so heavily censored that the joke is basically how censored it is cause you&#39;ll never hear the actual words. You just hear bleep bleep bleeeep bleep bleep bleep and some bleep bleep and then everyone around the character is just shocked and I&#39;m just pissed. Why can I see a character get brutally killed in the most horrific way possible but not hear fuck? Why can I watch a character get sexually assaulted or even raped but as long as I don&#39;t see a dick or a nipple then I&#39;m good? I can watch mass genocide or listen to hate speech but can&#39;t hear cunt?</p>\n\n<p>The dumbest part of all of this is 99% of us know exactly what is being censored. It doesn&#39;t actually work as censoring if your mind fills in the blanks. Sure if the screen went completely black whenever nudity or sexual content came on or you censored the whole sentence instead of just the &quot;bad&quot; word then yeah it&#39;d work but we don&#39;t do that. It feels like we simply do the level of censoring we do to make the 0.001% of the population who would be lose their shit happy but why the fuck do we care what they think? They aren&#39;t watching the fucking shows! No way you are a stick up the butt prude and like watching South Park and rick and morty and you draw the line at nipples and fucks. Why do we pander to the extreme minority? We could uncensore every adult program and nothing would happen and everyone who watches these programs or listens to these songs would still listen and watch and the only mad ones would be people who don&#39;t even consume that media</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
