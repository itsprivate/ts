And that’s saying a lot since many consider COVID’s health risks to be negligible even before a vaccine existed. Since May, 99% of COVID deaths were unvaccinated people. Most of the unvaccinated are that way by choice, not medical necessity. We are at the point where anyone who wants the vaccine can get it.<br/>\nI did my part. I wore my mask, practiced social distancing, and got my vaccine as soon as I could. I don’t have a problem with the unvaccinated choosing to have a 100x higher risk of dying to COVID but I should not bear any burden of mitigating that risk for them.  </p>\n\n<p>[edit] since so many are bringing up immunocompromised people: We were never expected to mask up to protect them from any viruses prior to COVID. Since COVID may not be eradicated with a vaccine, this is essentially an argument for wearing masks forever, since there will always be immunocompromised people. No.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
