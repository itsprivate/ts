We do not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you &quot;vote&quot; for a candidate in a representative body that loses their election, you have no voice in our democracy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order to give people true voices in their politics, we should move to affirmational representation.  This would mean the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Elections are just periods in which you can select your representative.</li>\n<li>Any representative is now a member of that body representing  and casting X # of votes.</li>\n<li>For ease of discussion and debate (US House of Reps example) only the top 435 representatives sit in the house for debate.  Others can cast votes, but not debate. </li>\n<li>Voting inside the body will thus be based on total votes.  For example, you may need 150,000,000+ votes to pass a bill in the House of Reps in the United States.</li>\n<li>Non-voters could be considered &quot;okay with any&quot; and their representation could be split proportionally amongst all eligible.</li>\n<li>A person election to say &quot;none of these&quot; would be a vote of no confidence, and thus &quot;against&quot; any bill that comes before the body.</li>\n<li>Same restrictions on candidacy, term limits, etc. can apply is so chosen.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Example of how this would work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You turn in a ballot with a person&#39;s name on it.</li>\n<li>If they get enough votes to pass the minimum threshold (or not, maybe no threshold) is now your representative.</li>\n<li>Every &quot;election&quot; you get to choose someone new, or the same person.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>CMV: This would be an ACTUAL Representative Body.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
