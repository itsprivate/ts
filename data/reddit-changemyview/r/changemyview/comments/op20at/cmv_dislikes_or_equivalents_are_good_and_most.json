  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently, Twitter has been looking into adding dislikes to their platform. I think this is actually a good idea, and in the long run will mitigate toxicity on the platform.   </p>\n\n<p>I know that at first it might seem like a dislike or negative rating feature will exacerbate toxicity, but I believe the opposite is actually true. Dislikes are a good feature because they&#39;re the lowest impact form of giving a negative response. When we see something we dislike, we are inclined to interact with it. A simple dislike button gives us that catharsis without doing much to the original content or giving people who disagree with you an opportunity to argue further.         </p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way: If you&#39;re on Reddit and you see something you don&#39;t like, what do you do? You usually just press downvote and move on. But let&#39;s say you&#39;re on Twitter and see something you don&#39;t like. What do you do? No dislike button. So the closest option is to reply or quote retweet, both of which actively spread the material you don&#39;t like and open you up to arguments. If there was a dislike button, controversial tweets wouldn&#39;t get much traction. Same goes for TikTok, I think the constant reply videos we see wouldn&#39;t be as prolific if you could just dislike videos and move on. Now I know that arguing isn&#39;t always bad, but let&#39;s face it, we all do too damn much of it on the internet these days, and I think that adding in simple dislike buttons would be a good way to reduce the amount of arguments we have.         </p>\n\n<p>Another good feature of dislike buttons is that they give a very concise measure of how people are responding to your post. If all you have to go on are likes and comments that doesn&#39;t tell you much about the general public response, but likes and dislikes being binary let&#39;s you see what the response is at a glance.    </p>\n\n<p>Edit: To be clear, I don&#39;t fully agree with Reddit&#39;s downvotes lowering the visibility of posts to the extent that they do. I don&#39;t think that this is something intrinsic to dislike buttons, so it&#39;s not too much of a concern of mine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
