I often hear people complain that education should be equal and people shouldn&#39;t have to move to give their kids a great education.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, I agree.  But its just not realistic for a number of reason.</p>\n\n<p>Biggest one is that states set their own standards.  When some states ban teaching evolution, or accurate history (ie the civil war wasn&#39;t about slavery), well you can&#39;t be surprised that many of those states have a worse education system.</p>\n\n<p>However, even if you go into a major city, there will be differences that can&#39;t be evened out.  I used to teach in Chicago, so I&#39;ll use that as my primary example.</p>\n\n<p>Biggest reason, is parents.  I know, a lot of people hate blaming parents for things.  But, its true.  The first school I taught at, which was in a pretty bad area of town, the parents didn&#39;t give a shit.  We literally had to bribe them with raffles to come to parent teacher conferences.  They often would blatantly disrespect the teacher, and showed pretty clearly that they didn&#39;t value education.  So if that is what the kids were getting, they won&#39;t value education either.  So one can&#39;t be surprised those kids don&#39;t do well.   Conversely, the nicer areas of towns typically had more 2 parent households, where both parents were college educated, and therefore valued education more.  Not that those parents can&#39;t have their own set of difficulties, but in general, the kids are going to do better.</p>\n\n<p>Next up are teachers.  Let me be clear, I fully believe 90% of teachers have great intentions.  But no matter where you teach, its difficult.  Even if you start your career wanting to change the world and help the kids who need nit most, eventually, many people don&#39;t want to work harder than they need to.  Teaching at a school with better behaved kids and more cooperative parents is just easier and frankly more enjoyable.  So many teachers who get experience and the ability to go to a better school, will do so when they get the chance, leaving the worse schools to have a lot more teacher turnover over the years.</p>\n\n<p>Finally there are the conditions they are teaching in.  Even if the worse schools get the same resources, it is far more than that.  Many of the kids in these worse schools, have lots of issues.  The pandemic essentially opened a lot of peoples eyes to how many kids depends on school for meals.  So you have kids coming in hungry.  Often the neighborhoods aren&#39;t as safe.  There are more social issues they are dealing with.  Is it shocking that a kid living in a gang infested neighborhood, with no food at home, and a single parent working 2 jobs and not able to spend much time with them isn&#39;t doing well?</p>\n\n<p>These differences are most easily seen in a city like Chicago, but can also be seen in neighboring towns with different demographics.</p>\n\n<p>So with all of these things, unless we abolish the idea of neighborhood schools and bus kids to schools to spread out the privileged and underprivileged kids, while constantly updating it every few years, its just never going to be equal.  Change My View.</p>\n\n<p>(Note, I&#39;m only talking US schools, I have no idea how the education system in other countries could work)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
