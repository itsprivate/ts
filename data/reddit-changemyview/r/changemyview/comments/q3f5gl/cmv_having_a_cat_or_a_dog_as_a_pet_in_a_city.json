Dogs have it better, at least they get walked outside a few times a day. Still, spending the day alone in a city flat, waiting for the owner to come home from work and not being able to run outside and explore (in a garden, for instance), cannot be animal-friendly.

I wasn’t aware of this fact nor the official recommendation to keep cats indoors due to that. Thank you for your input.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
