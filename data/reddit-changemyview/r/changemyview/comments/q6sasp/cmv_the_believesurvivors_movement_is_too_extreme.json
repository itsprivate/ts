It primes the case in the accusers&#39; favor.\nIf someone claims to have been sexually assaulted, their claim should be taken seriously and investigated, but you shouldn&#39;t outright believe that they are in fact correct in their claim. \nClaims of this nature need to be investigated, and a solid conclusion needs to be reached. If there&#39;s insufficient evidence to warrant the belief that the accused is guilty, then they shouldn&#39;t be punished. The best we can do for the alleged victim at that point is to separate the two of them, and keep closer tabs on the accused.</p>\n\n<p>I understand this is a difficult crime to investigate, but you&#39;re risking ruining people&#39;s lives if they turn out to be innocent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
