I am an atheist (i think it fits my mindset best). After some time of arguing wether religions are good or bad in different ways, i have been hit with \"But religion is the reason most people do charity work in the first place. Also, most people only behave nicely because they feel like someone is watching them.\",  \nmost of the time. \n\nI never managed to get through this entirely. I do not think people get their moral from religion whatsoever. \nSure, some will do, but I think, those people would still be nice and honorable people even if religion would not exist. They just don't know, because there religion is a thing in the first place and no one can no how it would be without it. To me, moral is something society teaches you. Your parents, your friend, your teachers etc., all those people form your moral values.\n\nI also don't get where this comes from in the first place. I mean sure. The bible. But there are so many books in the history of mankind that teach moral values and concepts, maybe far better than the bible does it. Why don't people care about those? Also, the concept of \"needing someone to watch people, so that they are nice to each other\" seems pretty ancient to me.\n(Please insert every other Religion in here. I am talking about Christianity because it is the most familiar to me, but the concept fits with every other Religion as well.)\n\nThe second version of this argument, i also hear sometimes is: \"Atheists can't explain the origin of moral either.\". That's also something I don't get. \n1. They can. In my opinion the origin of moral and especially social behavior is a biological one. Social behavior is natural and essential to mankind's rise. Higher level moralities are then formed by societies over longer times. \n2. However, regardless of this theory maybe being true or false, why does it matter? Why is this question so important? And, again, where does religion take it's moral from? Old books and an almighty god simply not seems sufficient to me.\n\nThanks for reading :) I don't want to offend anyone, with this. So please, if you are a theist, or even an atheist and feel offended, please tell me.\nI just have these questions in my mind and I'm curious of what you think.",
