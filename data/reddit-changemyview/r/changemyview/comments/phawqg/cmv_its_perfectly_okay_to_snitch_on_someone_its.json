Now, this doesn’t mean report petty little bullshit, but I’ve seen situations that were 100% worth reporting but the person was pressured into not reporting due to having a “snitch” label. For example, in 9th grade, my phone got stolen during gym. When I reported it, the friends of the guys who stole it called me snitch. Fuck you, if it’s worth reporting I’ll report it. Now, I can understand in situations where it’s life threatening (like in prison or a crime) where snitching could literally get you KILLED, but other than that, like in school or something of a similar setting, snitching is perfectly fine and I encourage it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
