So if someone buy X gun that is made from Y manufacturer and they kill 10 people with that gun, Y manufacturer in no way should be held liable for that persons actions. \n\nThe distributor who sold got it to a gun shop and the FFL who sold it to the person after the proper process should also not be held accountable at all. \n\n\nGun manufacturers should be held accountable if they make a low quality product that causes harm to the user or they blatantly lie about features or abilities of their product (just like any other manufacturer of other goods). \n\n\nI also don’t believe someone like Audi, Nissan or Jeep should be sued if someone drives drunk and kills 3 people. Or even if the purposely kill someone with their vehicle. Busch or Heineken shouldn’t be held liable if someone commits a crime under the influence of one of their beverages.\n\nSo CMV, why should gun companies be able to be sued for someone suing their product illegally?",
