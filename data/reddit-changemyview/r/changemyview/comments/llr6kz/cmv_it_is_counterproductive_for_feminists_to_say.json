Men can be feminists too and saying this alienates some from joining. I've heard that it's a joke and men shouldn't get angry at it, but I feel like if we want to stop toxic masculinity and tell men that their emotions are valid, if they are offended by generalisations about them, we should respect that. \n\n\nSome feminists told me that the men who were going to judge the whole movement by the actions of a few, they never wanted to join in the first place. That these men are the problem, rather than people saying #killallmen. I agree that these men are a problem, but I also don't see how that means I have to be okay with feminists saying #killallmen either. I can dislike two things at the same time. If you don't like men judging the whole feminism movement based on the actions of a few, you shouldn't judge all men based on the actions of some men. So I think they're both part of the problem.\n\n\nI was told that it is punching up rather than punching down and therefore it's okay. But even though women aren't killing men en masse, men are still getting killed by other men and dying from work-related incidents at a much higher rate than women are, they also die at a younger age than women. This explanation ignores the fact that there are a few things men are disproportionately affected by.\n\n\nI also feel like statistics and facts, such as \"1 out of 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape\", are much better at raising awareness. Why make *untrue* hyperbolic statements, like all men are bad, when the *actual* statistics are shocking enough without hyperbole or exaggeration?\n\n\nI have also heard that #killallmen and misandrist statments are said out of frustration and as a form of venting, and I can understand it's frustrating, but I see that as an explanation rather than an excuse.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit**\n\n\n\n*This* is the post I made before that sparked me to make this cmv. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/lkalii/how_do_you_deal_with_killallmen_people/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",
