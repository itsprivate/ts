This is basically my first exposure to a real US court and a trial ever, and the one thing that has surprised me the most is the treatment and status that is given to the judge, the dynamics of the judge&#39;s interactions with everyone else, as well as the behavior of the judge (at least in this case) holding that position. </p>\n\n<p>My view is very simple, there&#39;s no place for that type of treatment for anyone in a modern society, it can become problematic very easily and there&#39;s simply no need for it. </p>\n\n<p>The way the judge gets to basically yell at people and have clearly emotional responses to what&#39;s just his job is unacceptable, and it&#39;s kind of reminiscent of a monarch (obviously not in every aspect). For example, everyone has to bow their head and listen if the judge interrupts them, but can&#39;t dare to interrupt the judge because he&#39;ll get mad (literally).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/qtah01/to_be_a_karen_in_court/\">Found this on the front page today and it kind of shows what I mean.</a>. This judge is clearly emotional about what&#39;s going on and, regardless of what they are responding to, shouldn&#39;t talk that way to anyone. If anyone dared to talk that way to that judge, that person would have to face consequences decided by that judge.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, I&#39;m not arguing against the judge&#39;s job. I understand the need for their position in the current system. I just think that the kind of behavior I&#39;m talking about, or things like having to address them as &quot;your honor&quot;, or standing for them, shouldn&#39;t be seemed as normal and so easily accepted.</p>\n\n<p>E: Just saw all the responses, I&#39;m a bit slow cause I&#39;m at work, but I&#39;ll answer all the direct responses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
