If a band whats to use effects or have members playing multiple instruments it allows them to do so. This is good. </p>\n\n<p>Live shows can provide an amazing atmosphere and performance, at their best creating an almost religious experience for those attending, as well as bonding experiences for friends going together. This is also most excellent.</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, my issue is that with an album of a live recording, you lose what is best about both. Getting neither the production quality of studio albums, nor the raw experience of being at a mindblowing performance.</p>\n\n<p>I can kind of understand having a recording of a gig you went to, for posterity&#39;s sake, but even then, it isn&#39;t going to match the experience of actually <em>being</em> there. There is perhaps an accessibility argument, but even then, I&#39;d suggest watching a video of the gig, to get the full AV show, instead of just an audio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to write this, but can you explain <em>why</em> a certain recording of a live show is not worse than either seeing it live or a studio version, instead of just listing your favourite recording.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: After a few responses, I&#39;ve hit on the crux of this CMV; &quot;what does a live recording bring that neither IRL gigs or studio albums do?&quot;. Answer that, and I&#39;ll be putty in your hands.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
