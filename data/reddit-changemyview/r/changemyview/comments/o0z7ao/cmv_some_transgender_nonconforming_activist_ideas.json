You can't simultaneously teach the most extreme forms of trans acceptance and that gender roles are harmful social constructs.\n\nSo basically, we're trying to open up our society to all of these different ways that people can and do identify. That is a good thing. I'm down for radical tolerance. However, we're also trying to instill the fact that gender expression is a societal phenomena, which can be restrictive and harmful. \n\nI think this creates a paradox. It's like this \"gender roles are a social construct, you don't have to base your behavior or identity on them. But, if you don't identify with society's portrayal of this gender, you're probably some other gender.\"\n\nI think that this presents a huge problem. Are we attempting so hard to be accepting to non-traditional genders, that we're failing at destroying gender roles? \n\nI care because my daughter might come to me some day, questioning her assigned gender. Do I tell her that identifying with \"boy\" things doesn't make her a boy, or do I tell her it's okay if she feels more like a boy than a girl?? \n\nMy mind could be changed if someone presented me with a fairly concrete definition, which explains the differences between these things. Thanks for your thoughts.\n\nEdit: thank you, everyone, for the civility and understanding. I was really worried I might come off as transphobic, and y'all have showed me a lot of patience. I appreciate it.",
