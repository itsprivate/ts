Also, even though I might be “entitled” as a black person to say the n-word, I would prefer to keep this post formal and professional, and I don’t think that freely throwing around the n-word promotes that tone. I should also add that I’m mostly referring to the n-word with an “a” on the end, not an “r”. The version with an “a” is the one that has been reclaimed as a part of black vernacular, and that is mainly what I am referring to.\n\nBut basically the title. I think it’s absurd for a word, any word, to be acceptable for a certain race to say, but unacceptable for any other race. Many black people I know use the n-word freely among themselves, but get extremely offended when a non-black person says it. I think that makes no sense at all, but clearly I am in the minority (no pun intended).\n\nI understand that the word’s meaning depends hugely on the intent with which it is used. But I ask you this. Why should a black person using the n-word to mean “dude” or “bro” be any different than a white person using it that way? The word is the same and the intent is the same, but the only difference is the skin color of the person saying it. To me, one of these situations being perfectly fine, and the other being extremely offensive makes no sense at all. Why should black people be willing to forget the history of the term when another black person says it, but then suddenly remember that history when a white person says it?\n\nOne of the counterarguments I am expecting is that black people using the n-word among themselves promotes a sense of unity as a race. My response to that is that we already have the word “brother” which is used as a term of address among black people. Unlike the n-word, “brother” is not in any way offensive, however it does give black people with a way to address each other while providing a sense of unity. \n\nLike I said I think the n-word should either be considered offensive for anyone to say, or be considered acceptable for anyone to say. To do anything else is ridiculous and hypocritical. Can someone change my mind?",
