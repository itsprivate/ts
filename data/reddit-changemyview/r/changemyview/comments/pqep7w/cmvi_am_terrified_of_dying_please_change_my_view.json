I have lived a good life so far, I am only 25 years old and have much life ahead of me. I am loved by my family, friends and girlfriends. But I am absolutely terrified of death. The never ending nothingness is horrifying to me. Ceasing to exist forever. People always say, well you were not alive for billions of years, and nothing even mattered then so you won’t even care when you are dead.

Please help me change my mind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
