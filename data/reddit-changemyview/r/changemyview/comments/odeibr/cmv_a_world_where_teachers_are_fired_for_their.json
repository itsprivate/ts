It isn&#39;t reasonable in the first place to care if the teacher was once a stripper. </p>\n\n<p>I guess this is a complex issue with multiple layers but I think the entire process and the view that its OK to fire is all wrong. If its about how the kids will react if they find out their teacher is a sex worker, I think keeping the teacher and fostering a society that is sex positive will change exactly the problem people think will happen. Obviously its easier said then done. I would like to live in a world where kids just shrug and say, oh my teacher was a sex worker? Whatever. Children shouldn&#39;t be watching porn anyways so if they do find out that&#39;s on the parents who gave them access. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, my view is a world where teachers aren&#39;t fired for their sex work is better than a world where they do</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
