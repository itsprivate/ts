  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Defining antivaxx as people who are against all vaccines. The true original definition before COVID ever happened.</p>\n\n<p>I truly believe that we&#39;re past the point of censoring the outspoken to unknown platforms, because they are now everywhere. It&#39;s not just reddit, or Facebook, or Twitter. It&#39;s Instagram and NextDoor and I saw it in descriptions and feedback on Airbnb. It is now everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>And I think various people dropped the ball. I think that it was very unwise of various politicians and news companies to &quot;raise a concern about the vaccine being rushed to help Trump&quot;, and I think that it was unwise for platforms like reddit and Facebook not to foresee this exact thing happening and nipping it in the bud when it started.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, your next door neighbor heard something about something, and more people than ever have become truly &quot;vaccine hesitant&quot;. Not just COVID vaccines; all vaccines. The same people I was trying so hard to understand before all of this happened, are now all around me eager to share their thoughts, even in person.</p>\n\n<p>I think at this point, the only way out is to combat the misinformation, not pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. Reddit and other platforms can ban subreddits, but it&#39;s been complicit in letting it get here, and I don&#39;t think there are too many people left who have no opinion at all. A true crowd-sourced campaign to explain why misinformation is misinformation, including in the communities that are anti-authority--which really, these communities are--is the only way forward.</p>\n\n<p>Simply banning them and assuming that they&#39;ll at least go elsewhere is helping the rest of the reddit community feel good about ourselves, but addresses no issues, makes no strides forward to change the narrative, and may even hinder the potential progress. Everyone has heard of the COVID vaccines. Some people are hesitant. Removing any platforms that say anything but positive views, will drive them toward more &quot;research&quot; that will create more hardcore antivaxxers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
