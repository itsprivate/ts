If you don't feel like clicking the article I linked to, here's the bit that I really want to focus on:\n\n *Harvard and Yale—two of the world’s most prestigious institutions—actively* [*discriminate against Asians*](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/06/23/a-lawsuit-reveals-how-peculiar-harvards-definition-of-merit-is)*.

But what really got me thinking how they hell is whether or not someone is \"Asian\" any kind of factor, at all?\n\nSomething like [60% of the entire population](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237584/distribution-of-the-world-population-by-continent/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20about%2059.51,total%20population%20by%20continent%20here) of the world lives in Asia.  Are we supposed to believe that  someone from Bangladesh, a country with a per capita income of less than $5000 per annum should be measure by the same standards as someone of Japanese decent, a country that has one of the highest standards of living in the world?\n\nAnd what is an Asian?  I'll bet if you looked at [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmyks#/media/File:Kirsan_Ilyumzhinov_2014.jpg), you'd say, \"Yep, that is an Asian person!\"  You would be wrong he is European.  And indigenous to European Russia at that. OK, what about [this person](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ksenia_Sukhinova#/media/File:MissWorld_2008_(cropped).jpg)?  She's a native of Asia, born at the same longitude as New Delhi. \n\nSo, would someone please tell me how Asian can be used as a standard for anything?  You can find people of every race, religion, socio-economic group, political affiliation, and skin tone living in Asia!\n\nYes, I know that on average people of Asian extraction (60% of the world) do quite well in America.  Do you think that matters to people from Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Bangladesh, who are immigrating to escape abject poverty?\n\nThis just goes to show how utterly arbitrary race is and why parental income is a much better factor to take into account in admitting people to prestigious educational institutions.  \n\nChange my view.",
