This tiny, but vocal, group continues to push policies that are deeply unpopular to the detriment of Democrats. </p>\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves-in Minneapolis, voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have replaced the police department with a public safety group. In Virginia, voters chose the candidate who promised to ban CRT from schools. When a progressive runs against a more moderate candidate, the moderate usually wins. Shontel Brown who ran on the slogan &quot;evolution not revolution&quot; has done very well in all recent elections. It&#39;s clear what voters want and it doesn&#39;t appear to be what the woke left wants. </p>\n\n<p>Even If all of the woke left&#39;s policy ideas were great and would really create a better society (I&#39;m skeptical, but who knows) they aren&#39;t popular enough to get passed. The woke left&#39;s support is not sufficient to win elections because they make up such a small part of the voter base and so many people are deeply against them. </p>\n\n<p>I think the Democratic party would be far better off losing the support of the woke left and possibly gaining the support of independents. From a strictly political standpoint, it seems like the best strategy. But I&#39;m open to changing my mind if the evidence suggests otherwise.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
