I realise this will possibly be an unfamiliar topic to the majority of reddit, but, as a Eastern European, I keep bumping into restrictions that honestly make no sense to me. </p>\n\n<p>Exhibit A: I&#39;ve got a bluetooth speaker with Alexa on it. I&#39;ve got a Spotify premium. When I try to connect the two, the Alexa app just doesn&#39;t let me use the two services I already paid for because of the region lock. This benefits noone, except maybe Jeff Bezos, who wants to force me into subscribing to an inferior and more expensive service.</p>\n\n<p>Exhibit B: I used to have an EA Origin account, and most of the games I bought were only available in Russian, which is not our official language, and most young people don&#39;t speak it. Again, what is the point?\nEven if the developers don&#39;t want the developed countries&#39; citizens to abuse our regional prices through VPN, punishing the local players by forcing them to play the game in a specific irrelevant language is just evil and not an adequate solution.</p>\n\n<p>Exhibit C: Spotify again. It doesn&#39;t let people listen to podcasts here. And no, no local app is being protected by our government, as I&#39;ve heard people say, because we don&#39;t have those apps at all. There is no one whose interests would be infringed upon by allowing spotify to play podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, maybe there is an aspect I am not seeing here, in which case please CMV.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
