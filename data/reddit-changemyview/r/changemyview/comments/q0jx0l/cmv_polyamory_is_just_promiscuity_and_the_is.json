People say it selfless but I disagree the idea of committing yourself to one person is quintessential to love. It just feels like people are trying to eat there cake and have it to. I’m not just talking about jealousy, if you love someone doesn’t that come with some levels of sacrifice. It seems to me to be some strange in between of being single and getting what you want and being in a relationship where you have to consider another person. Just seems incompatible.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I misused terminology I’m strictly talking about an open relationships where only two people love each other and seek out other individuals purely for sex.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for the reply’s they did make me think. What I’ve come to is that every relationship is a negotiation between freedom and commitment and any healthy relationship needs both.  But these terms are up to interpretation and are agreed upon by the parties involved. The only problem I have left is the idea of excess and how much is too much but again that’s subjective.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
