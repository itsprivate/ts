Like people want to work less, have access to better healthcare, less inflation, affordable housing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>By <strong>&quot;issue&quot;</strong> I mean that the government is preventing prosperity and/or not helping it as defined above, and by <strong>&quot;worse&quot;</strong> I mean significantly more detrimental/less helpful than US billionaires.</p>\n\n<p>By <strong>&quot;misplaced anger&quot;</strong> I mean that in general mainstream political discourse (ie things like speeches from Sanders, Warren, etc) and the medias&#39; coverage (social and mainstream) there is far too much emphasis placed on blaming billionaires for various problems and &quot;hoarding money.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>General argument basis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total sum of all US billionaire&#39;s wealth (not even liquid) is now approximately 4.5 trillion (though I wager it&#39;s a bit inflated by the stock market atm and corrections will bring it back around ~4 trillion).</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a lot of money, but it is essential to understand that the vast <strong>vast</strong> majority of that money is simply tied to stocks and the value of publicly traded companies.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we understand how much wealth billionaires in the US have, let&#39;s look at some government spending. Let&#39;s look at two Covid bills specifically; Trump passed one that cost 2 trillion dollars, and Biden passed one that cost 1.9 trillion. If we round that to 4 trillion, I think the argument starts to become clearer. On just two bills alone, the government was able to spend nearly the entire net sum of the wealth of US billionaires. When the bills barely improved the average citizen&#39;s life, I think it&#39;s clear that the government is not capable of spending/distributing money in powerful/meaningful/efficient ways.</p>\n\n<p>On the basis that most people&#39;s &quot;hoarding wealth&quot; argument directed at billionaires seems to hinge on an authoritarian repossession/seizing of their wealth by the government, I think it&#39;s an immoral and laughably terrible course of action.</p>\n\n<p>I want to emphasize again, this was just two bills alone that cost nearly the entire wealth of US billionaires and made little difference to most people. By that logic alone, even with all of the wealth of US billionaires, the government could not and would not make any meaningful contribution towards prosperity, and that&#39;s disregarding the fact that the world economy would collapse if they simply sized all US billionaire wealth.</p>\n\n<p>So my basic question that I ask people arguing otherwise is -- how much money does the government need in order to improve things like healthcare, housing, inflation, etc? And keep in mind that they were able to spend 4 trillion that did little to nothing for you.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d absolutely have to arrive a number much greater than 4 trillion, and US billionaires simply don&#39;t have that kind of money to foot the bill.</p>\n\n<p>The government is the issue, not billionaires.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want to get into lobbying, I&#39;ll be a bit out of my depth because I don&#39;t have a firm grasp on the concrete machinations that go into it. Like I don&#39;t understand how it can be so effective apparently when the government can just spend obscene amounts of money with minimal repercussions. Is it a filtering/laundering racket? -like do the companies pay millions to a candidate that will pass a bill that benefits their business several million, which they then filter back to the candidate while taking their cut? Isn&#39;t the problem there still the government than?</p>\n\n<p>Change my view!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
