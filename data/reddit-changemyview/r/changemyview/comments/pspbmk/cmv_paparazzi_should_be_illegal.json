That’s beyond fucked and a massive invasion of privacy.</p>\n\n<p>This also touches the First Amendment, for all of my fellow Americans out there. There’s the issue of free speech and free press at play here. Obviously, to shut down one form of media suddenly becomes a huge warning sign to others that they might be next, and I’m aware of that. The difference here being that these people (if you can call them that) will stop at nothing to get some pictures of a celebrity that they can sell for a quick paycheck, including harassing children of celebrities that, and this is important, don’t know any better.</p>\n\n<p>Celebs know what they’re getting into when they become a household name, but it doesn’t mean their right to privacy should be thrown out the window.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
