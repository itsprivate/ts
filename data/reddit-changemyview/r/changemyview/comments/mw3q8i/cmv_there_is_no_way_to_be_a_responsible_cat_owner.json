  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is an opinion I&#39;ve had for a while and have tried to discuss with pro-outdoor cat people. I like to think most topics are nuanced (hence why I&#39;m posting it here), but I really have a hard time seeing <em>any</em> nuance with this one. Here is my reasoning, and I&#39;ll try to outline what arguments I&#39;ve heard that do not and probably won&#39;t convince me of anything:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cats a domesticated species. I hear people say they&#39;re &quot;half-wild&quot;, &quot;less domesticated&quot;, etc - but the type of cat that we as humans keep as a pet is literally a unique domesticated species. They depend on us for food, shelter, and healthcare. Ferals obviously exist, but their quality of life is poor comparatively.</li>\n<li>Going off of point 1, cats are not a naturalized species around the world. When allowed outdoors, they are an invasive species. Most wildlife around the world has not had the time to evolve in tandem with exposure to cats, and as such, cats continue to pose a huge threat to wildlife. In New Zealand, for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_New_Zealand\">cats are responsible for extinction of 6 bird species and 70 other species of wildlife.</a> From a purely ecological standpoint, it&#39;s extremely irresponsible to allow an invasive predator to freely hunt where you live - especially considering they often hunt and kill for fun, even when well fed, and even when wearing collars with bells.</li>\n<li>Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats. To name a few: dogs, other cats, raccoons, hawks, owls, skunks, foxes, cars, asshole humans, traps, rat poison, toxic plants, disease, etc. Even if your specific region doesn&#39;t have one or two random threats, there is nowhere people live that is free of threats to cats. As a pet owner, your responsibility is to provide a safe, healthy environment for them. Letting them free-roam lets them come in contact with any number of potential risks for injury, disease, and death.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Outdoor cats have a lower life expectancy than indoor cats.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>There are plenty of ways to provide your cat enrichment indoors and/or give them safe, supervised outdoor time (catios, leashed walking, etc) without compromising their health and wellbeing. I&#39;m not advocating for &quot;keeping them locked in a house with nothing to do&quot; - I think cats need playtime and enrichment, but that people taking the easy way out by letting them roam is lazy and irresponsible for the above reasons.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dogs also need enrichment and outdoor time, but for the most part, we don&#39;t let them free-roam neighborhoods and cities like we do cats.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think that many people have the idea that cats are low-input pets who need little to nothing from them, which perpetuates neglect and poor welfare for them. Instead of challenging these ideas, we keep just putting them outside in the name of their enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>I should also add that this post isn&#39;t about barn cats - I am separately critical of them (as a farmer), but this is about pet cats.</p>\n\n<p>CMV? I know I laid out a lot here, but I am genuinely interested if there are reasons with merit out there.</p>\n\n<p>*** EDIT: To clarify a couple points: I&#39;m specifically talking about <em>free roaming</em> outdoors, not about things where you let the cat on the porch for a few minutes and they don&#39;t go any further, supervised outdoor time, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m less compelled by arguments that nitpick at a particular risk (they&#39;re examples of an overarching issue), more interested in hearing reasons as to why it is <em>responsible</em> to let cats free-roam.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
