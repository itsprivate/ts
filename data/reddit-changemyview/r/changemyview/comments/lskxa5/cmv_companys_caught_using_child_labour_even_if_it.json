Not just profit.\n\nI do not think the idea that \"the company did not know about the child labour.\" That is used when they hire a smaller company that has any merit as a defence either. Gross negligence is not an excuse for any other crime. And should not be here either. A worker that got hurt due to a ceiling beam would not be unable to sue since the company had no way of knowing water damage had acquired.\n\nEdit 1: I should have been more clear on this. I am specifically referring to when a company send its work to be done by young children in 3rd world countries. Working for next to nothing.\n\nEdit 2: I am willing to admit defeat on the topic of gross negligence. Why I still do believe that a company that can be proven to know they knew of child labour, I admit I was to casting too broad of a net. As I was only thinking of companies that would try to use smaller companies that they did not technically have affiliation with as a means of circumventing the law. And not of the dozens of reasons that a company may have reasonably done business with a company that was using child labour and they themselves be innocent.",
