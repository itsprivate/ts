It can cause serious brain damage that lasts into adulthood, predisposing the abused individual to depression, schizophrenia, neurocognitive deficits such as lower IQ and academic performance, irritability, aggression, suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, attachment disorders, and a dysregulated stress response. And that’s just the brain. These impairments in turn can cause shortened telomeres, increase low grade inflammation, poor metabolic regulation, leading to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disorders and so on. \n\nTreatment is also less effective in many patients of this population. Depression, for instance, tends to be more severe and more likely to be treatment resistant. All of which can culminate in lower employment and financial success and a shorter lifespan.   \n\nAs such, I support the creation of a database for child abusers. I believe anyone convicted of a crime related to childhood maltreatment or deemed to be a maltreater by CPS or the courts should be required to register as a child abuser. This should also show up when they apply for anything requiring a credit check or for a job. They should also be required to publicly disclose that they are an abuser, even if the outcome is severely detrimental to them. These people create broken adults, and should be made to pay for it. As a society, we should want a world where abusing a child results in you losing your job and friends.\n\nEdit: it’s a thing already, so my post is moot. Let’s call it a day folks",
