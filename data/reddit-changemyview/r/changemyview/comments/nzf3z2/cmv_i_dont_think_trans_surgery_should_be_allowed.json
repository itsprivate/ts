I would never call someone out or insult someone for doing it, I just disagree. But my main opinion is that children who identify as trans should not be able to get the surgery. My reasoning for this is that\n1. Its a child, they can't make life changing choices, its really hard, and they might do something they regret later.\n2. If they go through with it, they might be bullied, harassed, threatened. \n3. I don't know how much trans surgery costs, but in America (even tho I'm pretty sure medically unnecessary surgeries are not free in other countries)\nIt most likely costs a ton of money. If this is a child, they can't pay the bill, so their parents have to. They lose a ton of money, and if their child regrets it, it makes them unhappy, and could be a complete waste of money.\n4. Kinda restating my first point, but I see grown adult trans people confused about what their gender is, and trying to figure it out. Now, instead of a stable adult, you make the adolescent hormonal teenager make the same choices. I don't think they should transition medically.\n\nI can see trans kids being 16 and transitioning, anything under that, I wouldn't support. I fully support them experimenting and wearing clothes of the opposite gender, and doing whatever to learn more about themselves. But I think they should wait until they are 16 or 18 to medically transition.\n\nPlease tell me if there is something I forgot about, or if you would just like to challenge my point. I'm a teenager myself, by the way. Thanks for reading.",
