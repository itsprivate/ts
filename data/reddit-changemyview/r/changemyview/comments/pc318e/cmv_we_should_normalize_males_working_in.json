How can a man have a role in a field requiring care for children if he is not trusted with children’s basic care? Fathers often change diapers, help children use the toilet, and put children down for naps. And maybe that’s what distinguishes early childhood education from other female-dominated professions. Declaring men unfit to provide such care is not only about sexism against men, it’s also about sexism against women. The greater the fear of men in caring professions, the more women are left to shoulder the responsibility of care work. If women experienced equality in all professions, then perhaps they wouldn’t regard child care as their exclusive domain, and wouldn’t feel threatened by the participation of men. How can we teach U.S. children not to regard early childhood education as the exclusive domain of women, when they see only women caring for them? What message are we sending today’s youth when we glorify involved fathers and stay-at-home dads but vilify male child-care workers? We should encourage more men to enter this field, and celebrate them rather than fear them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
