I believe weed should be regulated like any drug such as alcohol or tobacco. The reasoning behind this is that by keeping marijuana illegal we are doing more harm than good for our society. While many argue that cbd should be legal many are still reluctant to admit thc should be legal. Many point to the risk of psychosis but I would argue the risk of psychosis is amplified substantially by keeping weed illegal as it has shown that where cannabis has been kept illegal the potency of cannabis has become stronger. CBD has the potential to counteract the psychotic effects of THC and as such if weed was regulated the chance of having THC heavy strains would be reduced. Therefore if someone who was prone to getting psychosis decided to smoke the risk would be lesser to an extent. Others argue that legalisation might bring more people to smoke weed I however find this argument irrelevant as I believe if rational adults are able to drink they should be able to smoke as it is a much safer drug. By legalising we would undoubtedly see a decrease in underage smokers. Another problem with prohibition is the fact that in countries such as America it has direct racist implications for African Americans as police officers can fill up their arrest quotas or here in the UK where there has been controversy surrounding stop and search. By keeping weed illegal all we do is put money into the hands of criminals whom exploit the vulnerable in our society if we were to legalise cannabis we would see a better society.",
