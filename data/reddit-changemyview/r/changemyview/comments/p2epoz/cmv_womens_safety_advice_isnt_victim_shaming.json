I understand it seems like victim shaming, but its just to help keep women safe as telling men not to rape is not gonna work! Teaching men consent and etc at a young age will help but taking these precautions in the meantime and advising women do so is smart. Its NOT their fault if they get assaulted, whether or not they do these things, but fundamentally it could help you escape or avoid any <em>potential</em> incidents if your concerned while alone on the street. You can do everything at night wrong or right however, and it sill won&#39;t be your fault - but some rather fucked up that its needed but OK safety advice cant hurt </p>\n\n<p>I would recommend every person, if they are concerned to take some tips they hear. Look for a mom with kids that could help you. Go up to someone and pretend to be their friend and tell em quietly whats going on. Head to a friends place/crowded place rather than your home. It isnt victim blaming to share some helpful tips that can help ppl feel safer</p>\n\n<p>The only expections is &quot;dress modestly&quot; advice. Yeah fuck that advice men rape people not clothes wear what you want. </p>\n\n<p>I want to emphasise this again: if you don&#39;t follow the safety advice its STILL not your fault if your assualted, it is NOT your fault in the ever so slightest, at all. But i would recommend doing taking certain  precuations like the ones i listed to potentially prevent a nasty incident from happening IF and i mean IF you feel like they are necessary. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT ON THIS. If someone shoots you, its not your fault for not bringing a bullet proof vest. But if you can get a bullet proof vest that would be dead handy. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah, its fucked up, I agree, but we should tell women these safety advice if they ever end up in a situation where they feel unsafe and would need to use those tips - and sharing those tips is not victim shaming (UNLESS its framed as a &quot;responsible women do X&quot; or something that is legitimately victim blamey on purpose&quot;</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING Edit: most new comments are the same arguments and I just keep saying the same stuff over and over again so PLEASE CHECK if the argument you have has already been said and answered. If its not, then post. I just dont wanna repeat myself! Thanks for the consideration</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
