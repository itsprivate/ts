After 20 years, US forces are withdrawing from the region. I believe the war was a complete failure and his death was in vain. A view I haven&#39;t shared with anyone else. I would like to believe that his death served some greater purpose. That his sacrifice will benefit the world in some way. But it seems that the country of Afghanistan remains in turmoil and the US is no safer as a result of the massive military effort and thousands of lives lost. I come from a pretty liberal / anti-military perspective. In part due to the death of my friend. That said I have many friends and family who have served. I&#39;m asking this question here because I don&#39;t want to offend the people I care about by minimizing their experience. And of course because I can&#39;t ask the friend I lost. I wish I had spoken to him about why he volunteered and what he believed in but it&#39;s too late now. Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
