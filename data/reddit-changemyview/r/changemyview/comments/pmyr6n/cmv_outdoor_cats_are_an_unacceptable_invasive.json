It’s so commonplace and widespread to have a cat outside people joke and laugh about their cats being “killers” leaving native birds and reptiles on their doorstep. Occasionally they will catch a pest but people are completely unbothered by the hummingbirds, jays, and other important creatures left dead at their door. Feral cats should NEVER be fed just because you have a “big heart” and TNR doesn’t stop the killing. Leaving food out in colonies only causes aggression and attracts pests that will not be controlled by the cats. Cats are terrible pest control. Introducing one invasive species to take care of another is so 19th century. We should approach cat problems the same way we approach other detrimental species like cane toads. I bite my tongue a lot on this but as an environmentalist, I’m getting more and more frustrated with cat people. We need to accept humane euthanasia of feral cats and stop letting our hearts lead us when it comes to our fragile wildlife.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
