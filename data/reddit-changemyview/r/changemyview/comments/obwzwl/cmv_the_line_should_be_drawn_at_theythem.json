I see 0 reason why we need to have these in our society and what benefit they have: Maybe their is people who actually suffer from gender dysphoria and theirs people who don&#39;t feel like they identify with the gender binary. But why would anyone need to use these pronouns for any reason other than to feel special? this seems to me like nothing more than progression for the sake of progression, call me homophobic all you want but I refuse to call anyone by any pronouns other than him, they or her. Its not like viv/vov people have been oppressed for hundreds of years like gay people. The sad thing is, is most people who share this an opinion with me get &quot;canceled&quot; because criticizing lgbt is some godforsaken sin now a days. I hope this subreddit will understand my POV and give me genuine reasons for why &quot;neopronouns&quot; need to exist and not accuse me of being homophobic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
