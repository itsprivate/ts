Even western muslims want to alter the meaning of the religion to fit in their moral codes, as islam itself is very extremist and does not align with any western values and progressiveness in the 21st century that we are experiencing now. Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a man-made cult created during primitive times to capitalize on the ignorance of humanity pre-science that has only survived because of its fear and manipulation tactics, childhood indoctrination, and maslow’s social inclusion needs.
