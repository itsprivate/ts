If Facebook going down for half a day had that much of an impact on your life and you weren’t an employee...there’s an issue. But i digress, this happened YESTERDAY. </p>\n\n<p>At best this should’ve been labeled as a “Top story”. Breaking news should be reserved for stories that just happened and have either a significant local, national or world impact. To put it into context, this news station felt facebook being down yesterday was equally as important as the bombing in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>This method of using “breaking news” to get viewers and then presenting bs makes news stations lose credibility. It’s the YouTube equivalent of clickbait. </p>\n\n<p>It also can’t be good for people’s mental health since a lot of older people probably relate “breaking news” with 9/11. But it’s all for ratings</p>\n\n<p>I believe there’s a criteria for a program to be considered news vs entertainment. For news they should add standards to what can be considered “breaking news”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
