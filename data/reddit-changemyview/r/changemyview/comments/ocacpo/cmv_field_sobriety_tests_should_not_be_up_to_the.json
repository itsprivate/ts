I was not on anything, my car was impounded for 30 days, and I had to miss work sometimes due to lack of ride, as well as going to multiple court dates because they kept scheduling them before they had the results, so I would wait all day in court only to be called up and rescheduled because they don&#39;t have the blood work back. Finally I go and they say &quot;oh your blood work was negative, you&#39;re free to leave&quot; but of course no refund for paying close to $2000 to get my car out of impound or anything. I&#39;m not sure what should be the exact solution to this, but I do know that something needs to change</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
