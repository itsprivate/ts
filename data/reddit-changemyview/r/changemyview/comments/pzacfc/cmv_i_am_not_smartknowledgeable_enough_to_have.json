Most people want to be on the side of justice, equality, etc., and very few people (I hope) believe that things like racism are ok opinions to have. I am obviously in the camp of “racism is bad”, which to most means that I should agree with the political left. However, I’ve still been hesitant to pick a firm side, and dont have a firm political identity at the moment. I’m trying to decide if that should change.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s use Ben Shapiro as an example for a moment. It’s easy to make fun of him, call him racist, etc.. And those opinions of him may even be correct.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is, he doesn’t see himself that way - he has reasons for his views. And I have no doubt that if I ever met him and debated about any of these issues, that he would beat me in the debate. He has spent much more time than I have analyzing these issues, is probably objectively a smarter person, and will be able to point to facts that I’d never heard of to support his point.</p>\n\n<p>Before anyone starts claiming that this is an “appeal to authority” fallacy or anything like that, the purpose of this post is NOT to say that Ben Shapiro is right. He may very well be wrong, and would only beat me in a debate because of my own limitations, but would lose in a debate to others with a deeper political understanding.</p>\n\n<p>However, what this means to me is that at the current level of understanding of politics that I have, I can’t refute his points. I also can’t refute the points of AOC or anyone else on the left - these people are all much more equipped than I am to answer complicated questions.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do I pick a side on any issue for which there isn’t an expert consensus? Even if I think one side is correct, there is almost undoubtedly information that points the other way, that if I learned about I would not have an answer ready on why whatever side I chose is still actually correct.</p>\n\n<p>Note: for certain individual policies that DO have expert consensus, I have picked a side. That means that I believe climate change is a man made issue, there wasn’t massive voting fraud, the vaccines are safe, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Since most individual views that I’m comfortable taking a stance in agree with the liberal party, I’d probably classify myself as left leaning if forced to choose. However, I know many conservatives who don’t believe the “crazy” side of right wing ideology, but strongly believe in right wing policies related to economics and immigration, and disagree with liberals about what is considered racist and how to solve issues such as racism/global warming. </p>\n\n<p>People on both sides of the fence for these issues are smarter and more knowledgeable than I am, and understand the issues on a much deeper level than I do. How can I claim to choose a side while knowing that?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
