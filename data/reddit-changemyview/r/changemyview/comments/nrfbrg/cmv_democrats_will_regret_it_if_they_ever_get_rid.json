The Republicans will be back in charge of both chambers at some point in the future. And if the filibuster is gone when they, AND Mitch McConnel is still senate majority leader....watch out. He's already proven he's more than willing to fight fire with napalm. And, if that filibuster is gone when that time comes, there is no doubt in my mind that Republicans will advance legislation that Democrats and the majority of voters find abhorrent, but there will be nothing they can do. \n\nOne argument for getting rid of the filibuster is it will allow the passage of the new voting rights bill, which many Democrats believe will help ensure Republicans aren't allowed to steal elections through gerrymandering and local voting laws the discourage certain democrat leaning demographics from voting. My response to that is that it is simply absurd to believe that Democrats will hold onto both the House and the Senate forever. Republicans will win again at some point, and they will enact revenge.\n\nAs it stands now, the filibuster gives Democrats the ability to block some of the more egregious legislative goals of Republicans, and I think it is foolish to take away that ability.\n\nI think the better option is to overhaul the filibuster to make it politically difficult to filibuster, like it used to be. Require a quorum of the opposition to be present and for someone to hold the floor the whole time. By making it hard, it will incentivize the use of the filibuster only in the most politically expedient of times (like what Democrats recently did in Texas, which, again, is an example of how the filibuster can be a good thing). \n\nI'm open to my view being changed I'm just very distrustful of what Republicans would do once in power without the filibuster.",
