Unfortunately car travel for some is essential albeit damaging to the environment, those people are not to blame for the crisis and are being stopped from going about their day, could risk their job etc. </p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t bring attention to the problem I don’t think, it just causes delays and ruins peoples moods, I don’t think any of the motorists sat in traffic are deciding to ditch the car and become green. There are other forms of protest that are less distributive that would work better IMO, but it’s also not us that need targeting, it’s corporations, the government etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
