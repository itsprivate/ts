Even though their family is middle class, they are broke and financially struggling in their own right. Many can barely afford rent and live on ramen noodles every night. So why limit generous financial aid packages to low-income students?  Just because your parents make a middle class salary doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have enormous financial need. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
