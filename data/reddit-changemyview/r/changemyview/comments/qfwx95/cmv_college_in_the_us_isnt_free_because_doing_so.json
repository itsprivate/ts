Talking to many recruits and veterans, many of them bring up joining the army to pay off their college education because they didn&#39;t want to deal with Student Debt or having to ask people for money. If these programs weren&#39;t given, they personally wouldn&#39;t have gone to the military. If nationalized free college was realized in the U.S., many high schoolers would see no reason to join the army, and so recruitment numbers would fall drastically. Only the most patriotic members of society would volunteer into the military leaving the other potential recruits to get a post-secondary education. Of course, this could also just lead to the re-enactment of the draft and forced service, which is seen in other countries around the world (South Korea, Vietnam, ect).   </p>\n\n<p>P.S. There&#39;s an interesting article that goes into this idea more. <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2016/09/does-free-college-threaten-our-all-volunteer-military/\">https://warontherocks.com/2016/09/does-free-college-threaten-our-all-volunteer-military/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
