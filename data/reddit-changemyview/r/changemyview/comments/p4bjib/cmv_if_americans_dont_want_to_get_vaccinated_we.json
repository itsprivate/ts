Since a pandemic is global, we might as well put out the fire wherever we can as it’ll benefit us eventually (both health wise but also politically). Giving people a final notice might also significantly increase vaccination rates in the US since people will realize there will be a limited supply in the near future. If people change their mind, we can of course reintroduce the opportunity to get vaccinated. However, every minute anti vaxxers refuse the shot in the US is a minute that could be used to help save lives abroad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
