CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Washington Post, New York Times are all missing.  There are also some local smaller outlets reporting on this.</p>\n\n<p>This should really wake people up about what these media outlets are all about.  When the Kyle Rittenhouse shootings happened, all of the media outlets I named were reporting on those shootings non-stop for weeks.  There were many stories published as well as many opinion pieces.</p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s eerily quiet about an event that even objectively, just based on the number of victims is much bigger (6 killed and dozens wounded vs 2 killed and 1  wounded).  Not to mention that in this case the dead and injured include kids and women.  Also not even mentioning that this did not happen during a riot/protest, but was done at a peaceful parade.  Also done by a man with a violent criminal record who was out on bail at the time of the incident compared to Kyle with no criminal record.</p>\n\n<p>When I look at the MSNBC Daily today, 2 out of the first eleven stories they have are about Rittenhouse (they are still talking about Rittenhouse), there is stuff about white supremacy, trans deaths.</p>\n\n<p>The main story seems to be about Arbery and there is something about Trump.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing that even mentions Darrell Brooks or Waukesha.  CNN is similar, there is nothing on their main news pages about this.</p>\n\n<p>This is clearly evidence of media bias because this IS a big story, one that is objectively bigger that the Rittenhouse story at the time it happened (based on number and age of victims alone) and yet there is a lack of coverage of this case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
