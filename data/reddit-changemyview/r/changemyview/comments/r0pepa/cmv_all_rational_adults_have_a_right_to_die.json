This would somewhat exclude young children, infants, and animals which is why we do certain things without their consent, and I&#39;m not going to defend that parties with limited rationality have a right to die.</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate, the right to bodily autonomy would include a right to end one&#39;s life on their own terms because that is just a person exercising control over their body, and it doesn&#39;t violate the rights of anyone else. </p>\n\n<p>To clarify, a lot of suicides can be irrational. But I don&#39;t think suicide is ever immoral, unless perhaps if someone&#39;s dependant on you. </p>\n\n<p>Potential objections:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wanting to die is a sign of mental illness, and thus irrationality. So no one has the right to die</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is it irrational to want to die though? It is true that humans on average will value their own lives, but I don&#39;t think it follows from this that they therefore ought to value their own lives. Why is it always in one&#39;s self-interest to live?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You don&#39;t have a right to someone&#39;s labor, so you don&#39;t have a right to something like euthanasia or assisted suicide</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t disagree with this, however, I still think people should at least have the option to go see a doctor for the chance of receiving assisted suicide. People still have a right to at least associate themselves in consensual relationships where they get a say, so why can&#39;t a doctor and a patient engage in such a consensual relation? I don&#39;t think doctors should be fired for refusing to deliver a certain type of care, but this is still compatible with saying that the state should lift certain restrictions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who genuinely want to die will find ways to die without assisted suicide</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if completely remember the objection correctly, but I&#39;ll respond to this statement anyways. Yes, people may end up finding other ways to die if they&#39;re desparate, but I don&#39;t see how it follows that we need to maintain a restriction on something like assisted suicide. People still have a right to engage in certain consensual relations. They should have certain positive freedoms. Why would we need to limit their options? Now if the point of this objection is trying to say that it&#39;s useless to lift the restriction because people will just use other methods of killing themselves instead, then this arguably seems false. People will no longer have to use certain methods which are less successful or have a higher risk for leaving them disabled, and they also have an incentive to not commit suicide in public areas which will traumitize more people. Granted, in an assisted suicide scenario, you&#39;re probably still affecting the doctor mentally, but you&#39;re still traumitizing less people in that setting. </p>\n\n<p>Plus, the uselessness of lifting a regulation which infringes on bodily autonomy doesn&#39;t thereby follow that we shouldn&#39;t life that regulation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recognizing the right to die will lead to more irrational suicides and will lead to abuse</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think certain policies could be enacted to prevent irrational suicides. For healthy adults who want to kill themselves, there can be a waiting period put in place to give them time to think about whether they actually want to kill themselves. For adults who are chronically or mentally ill, I would rather they don&#39;t have a waiting period if they are in lots of suffering and want to get rid of it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
