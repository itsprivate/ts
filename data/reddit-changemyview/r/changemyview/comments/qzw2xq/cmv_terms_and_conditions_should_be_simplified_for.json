Allowing T&amp;C&#39;s to be simplified would allow consumers to make better informed choices before engaging in any contractual relationship. Consumers should be able to ascertain the fundamental principles that establish a contract with ease.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not suggesting the removal of the current T&amp;C&#39;s (they should be maintained for valid reasons that comments below explain) but rather a supplementary version alongside for ordinary consumers (in that the event or pursuit of any legal challenge is unlikely) that covers the essentials of a contractual relationship.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
