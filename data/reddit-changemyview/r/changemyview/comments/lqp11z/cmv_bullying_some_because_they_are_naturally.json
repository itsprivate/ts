In my first one I was still young and i was only called out once or twice for being ginger and didn't think much of it. eventually i was transferred to a different primary school and that's when the names and bullying started, if I told the teacher they'd make an excuse saying they are just playing , however there were 2 jewish boys in my class if they were bullied then they'd see the headteacher. it only got worse in seconds school for 5 long years I was picked on, punched and kicked even some teachers would treat me differently. 1 day i had an argument with a boy next to a teacher who pretended not to hear the other boy call me all insults for being ginger and attacking my family, so i was fuming and in rage call him a terrorist as he came from a muslim background (I know its a awful thing to do but i dished out the same crap back to him) at that point the teacher took me out for 1 slightly islamophobic while he'd give out a lot more against me and i was the 1 punished. Now if i said that was black and had to deal with that, I could sue the school, have them people who picked on me ruined for being racist or have people back me up, but because i'm ginger it's seen as a joke.\n\nEven out of the school system in pubs, shops and on the street im still called out for my hair by complete strangers for no reason. \n\nAlso don't say well you can dye your hair to change colour, you could say the same thing to black people Michael Jackson did it, or to gay people just be straight if you don't like being assaulted for being who you are. you probably can't change my view as I've had to deal with for the last 20 so years and your just reading about it but your welcome to convince me on how bully someones natural hair differs to someones natural skin.",
