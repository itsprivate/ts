A war that held very little if any benefits to the US.</p>\n\n<p>Wilson&#39;s attorney general Palmer was absolutely maniacal in his efforts to silence anti-war efforts. </p>\n\n<p>Night time raids and imprisonment were common.\nWilson was one of if not the most vicious racists to ever occupy the Oval Office. </p>\n\n<p>He was pro-KKK and installed segregation in federal offices. When a contingent of black citizens met with him to express their concerns, he declared them “uppity&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>He suffered a very serious stroke while in office which rendered him a bedridden invalid, nearly unable to speak. </p>\n\n<p>He was so power-mad, rather than resign due to his inability to perform his duties, he conspired with his wife to hide the extent of his illness and allowed his wife to essentially conduct presidential duties.</p>\n\n<p>Wilson felt the country&#39;s Constitutional federal republic form of government was obsolete. He was enamored, as were most “progressives&quot; in that era, with government with a strong presidency. </p>\n\n<p>He heartily disapproved of Congressional government, feeling that the checks and balances of three competing branches of government should be superseded by a strong presidency which would be relatively unimpeded by courts and Congress.\nHe was very much a “my way or the highway&quot; type of person. </p>\n\n<p>His proposal of the League of Nations was not confirmed by the Senate primarily because Wilson refused to compromise with the Senate on the US&#39;s role, despite clear indications from the Senate they were willing to work with him.</p>\n\n<p>Wilson was a man not known for his sense of humor. It was reported that the only time he was seen to laugh and smile was upon being informed of the death of Theodore Roosevelt, who had been a vocal critic of Wilson.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
