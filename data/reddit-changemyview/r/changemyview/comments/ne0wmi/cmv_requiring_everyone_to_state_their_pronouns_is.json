So now there's also mounting pressure on everyone to explicitly state their pronouns if they don't want to be misgendered as \"they/them\".\n\nI try not to assume people's gender based on their bodies because we can't easily control our body's appearance but I think it should be fine to make an educated guess on someone's gender based on the things people CAN control: clothing, hair, the name they go by, etc. If we do it like this, even an incorrect guess shouldn't be too hurtful because it's based on the choices they've consciously made.\n\nI feel like this should be a valid form of gender expression. I believe verbal communication is not the only valid form of communication. But these people seem to be saying, \"We get that you're probably a woman but we don't respect that because you haven't communicated it *verbally*. We only respect *verbal* communication. So we're going to feign incomprehension and keep misgendering you until you cave.\"\n\nI saw a trans person say we should write our pronouns because \"Gender expression doesn't indicate gender identity\" and that makes no sense to me.

I don't want to get called they/them and I don't want to have to explicitly make our genders the first topic of discussion whenever I meet a new person.
