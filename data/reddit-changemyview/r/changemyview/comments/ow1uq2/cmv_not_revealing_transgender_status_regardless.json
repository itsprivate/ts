There is no informed consent here so it is not right.</li>\n<li>Lastly we have the main reason I made this thread and the trickiest situation. We have a post op passing transgender person. Now in a perfect world I think they shouldn&#39;t ever have to reveal this status to anyone, but alas we do not live in that world at this moment. So let&#39;s consider the informed consent part, regardless of how much they pass, most people would not want to have sex with someone assigned at birth the opposite gender to what they are attracted to. Because of this if you are not revealing that fact before hand you are omitting something that would probably change the status of consent. Now there is an analogy I can make to help explain better that happens in the real world occasionally.  A man lies alludes to the fact he is very wealthy, through wearing fake watches and fake designer clothes. Because of this he sleeps with a women who is interested in guys like that, after the fact she finds out this information from a third party and feels bad and violated. Now, in the perfect world no factor like this would ever be a part of a sexual encounter, but again we cannot disconnect with reality. Basic logic reasoning. Many would not want to have sex with a transgender person regardless of surgery -&gt; This is commonly known to have a large affect on consent -&gt; not revealing it is purposely trying to avoid the commonly known situation of consent changing based on info -&gt; thus it is wrong and &quot;deceiving&quot; for one&#39;s own gain.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>TL;DR Please inform any potential partners all things that will likely change whether or not consent is given before anything happens</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
