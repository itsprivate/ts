We label people with certain geographic descriptors when said people are not from that geographic region. White people are not referred to as European-American, just American. Tagging on an extra descriptor adds a separate, divisive characteristic when there is no difference in where they were born. I understand respecting peoples&#39; cultural differences but labeling them something they&#39;re not is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I am very proud of my heritage. That is completely separate, but first and foremost I am American.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
