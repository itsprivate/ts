Getting braids in your hair when you’re not black and wearing a kimono when you’re not Japanese is okay you’re just appreciating aspects of another culture. I’m from Uganda (a country in east Africa) and when I lived there sometimes white people would come on vacation, they would where kanzu’s which are traditional dresses in our culture. Nobody got offended, nobody was mad we were happy to see someone else enjoying and taking part in our culture. I also saw this video on YouTube where this Japanese man was interviewing random people in japan and showed them pictures of people of other races wearing a kimono and asking for there opinions. They all said they were happy that there culture was being shared, no one got mad. When you go to non western countries everyone’s happy that you want to participate in there culture. \n\nI believe that cultural appropriation is now a western concept because of the fact that the only people who seen to get mad and offended are westerners. They twisted the meaning of cultural appropriation to basically being if you want to participate in a culture its appropriation. I think it’s bs.",
