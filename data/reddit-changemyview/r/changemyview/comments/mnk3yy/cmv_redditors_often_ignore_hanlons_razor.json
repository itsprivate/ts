Downvoting is abused by negging people who merely disagree with  you, instead of highlighting off-topic and not-helpful comments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What led to my view</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I have appealed for calm and dialogue on some subreddits like [REDACTED], it has always been met by what it seeks to criticise. I would be accused of being a troll while my intention was to call for dialogue instead of hate. I got &quot;what do you expect on here?&quot; which speaks directly for my view. A common assumption is &quot;you&#39;d also hate if you had been X&quot;, assuming I come from a place of ignorance, while the reality is I&#39;m old and quite experienced in getting the short end of the stick.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changing my view</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m just butt-hurt? Please, please don&#39;t just jump on this and start your response with &quot;Yes, you are butt-hurt&quot; as this will not work for me. Please be kind and relatable, that is how I learn.</p>\n\n<p>I think my expectations may be too high. Maybe I need to treat reddit like something disposable. Very open to these arguments.</p>\n\n<p>I feel it might simply be OK to judge people too harshly and bestow downvotes in one&#39;s personal interest, like some kind of humanism?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
