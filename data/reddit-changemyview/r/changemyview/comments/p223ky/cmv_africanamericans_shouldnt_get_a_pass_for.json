This has been broadly cited as a reason that African-Americans do not trust the government when they tell people they should get vaccinated, and specifically recently with regards to the Covid-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not a rational excuse in this case, because everyone across the country (and the world) is getting the vaccine.  African-Americans are able to see through any mainstream news source or in their own community that White people and other non-Black people have been getting the vaccine for well over 6 months.  There are no clear systematic racial differences in adverse effects from the vaccine.  This includes Black doctors and nurses.  Further, it is possible for potential vaccine receivers to talk to many vaccine workers who are African-American, who presumably would not give a shot that they didn&#39;t trust to others.  Therefore, any remaining hesitance on their part is no more legitimate than a White American who lacks critical thinking skills.  Further, policy-makers should not be deferential towards African-Americans based on the flawed reasoning explained above.</p>\n\n<p>This does not change the laudable goals of compassionate and empathetic outreach towards the unvaccinated.  I am in no way saying anyone should specifically criticize African-Americans any more than anyone else.  I just believe that race shouldn&#39;t play a role in how we are approaching the current situation of aiming to get more people vaccinated, because race isn&#39;t the problem to start with.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
