Most of us look at it as just another piece of the artist's toolkit, but the fact is that glitter was weaponized long ago by people willing to send envelopes full of glitter to your enemies, or even by the infamous porch-pirate revenge video who used weaponized glitter not once, but twice. \n\nNow, let's look at why glitter should not be available to the general public:\n\n1) It's a pollutive nuisance - glitter can't be recycled, and using it on regular paper materials means those can't be recycled either. Glitter can make its way into waterways and from there via fish directly into the food chain. There are already record levels of microplastic contamination discovered in tap water.  \n2) It's a health hazard - glitter can irritate your skin, or make its way in to your eyes and even blind you. The British Medical Journal has urged doctors to look out for patients complaining of swollen eyes and vision loss after a 49-year-old woman was almost blinded after glitter rubbed off a Christmas card into her eye. It had formed into a clump, causing a lesion. According to Frank Kelly, a professor of environmental health at King’s College London, \"[Glitter] could deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even into our bloodstream\". \n3) It's dangerous to have around the house - the fact that glitter is sold to everyone willy-nilly means that parents buy it for their children, who are not the sturdiest of creatures at the best of times. Knock over glitter once, and your home is no longer hospitable. Vacuuming or sweeping can never collect all the glitter, and once you knock it over, it becomes an actual menace/hazard: babies and pets can ingest the glitter, it gets all over everything, and all members of the household will transport the glitter throughout the house, extending it's reach and range.\n\nGlitter should be treated similar to any other chemical hazard which can cause drastic pollution, poison food chains, cause physical damage to multiple different systems of the body, and similar to some chemical agents and weapons, are extremely hard to purify an area once glitter begins to spread.\n\nI'm not saying that we should ban all glitter, as recommends Dr. Trisia Farrelly, an environmentalist from New Zealand’s Massey University (\"I think all glitter should be banned. Producers should not get away with making a profit out of the production of disposable, single-use plastics, while bearing little responsibility for the damage.\"). I can appreciate that it does have a place in the art world, but like other dangerous substances, glitter needs to be regulated and should not be available on the open market for whoever wants it.",
