I’ve tried to learn in other settings, but this is a sensitive subject and I feel like more often than not emotions were brought into it and whatever I had to say was immediately shot down.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost I don’t think any “name” like this is productive or beneficial. Black people have fought for a long time to remove the N word from societies lips, and POC as a whole are still fighting for the privilege of not being insulted by their community. I have never personally used a slur and never will, as I’ve seen personally how negative they can affect those around me. Unfortunately I grew up with a rather racist mother who often showcased her cruelty by demeaning others, and while I strongly disagree with her actions, there are still many unconscious biases that I hold that I fight against every day. This bias might be affecting my current viewpoint in ways I can’t appreciate. </p>\n\n<p>This is where my viewpoint comes in. I’ve seen the term colonizer floating around and many tiktok from POC defending its use, but haven’t seen much information in regards to how it’s benefiting the movement towards equality other than “oh people getting offended by it are showing their colors as racist.” Are there other benefits to using this term? </p>\n\n<p>My current viewpoint is that this term just serves as an easy way to insult white people and framing is as a social movement. I feel it’s ineffective because it relies on making white people feel guilty for their ancestors past, and yes, while I benefit from they way our society is set up and fully acknowledge that I have many privileges POC do not, I do not think it’s right for others to ask me to feel guilt about that. My ancestors are not me, and I do not take responsibility for their actions. Beyond making white people feel guilty, I have seen this term be used in the same way “snowflake””cracker” and “white trash” is often used. It feels like at its bare bones this term is little more than an insult. In discussions I’ve seen this drives an unnecessary wedge between white people and POC, where without it more compassion and understanding might have been created. </p>\n\n<p>I COULD BE WRONG, I could very easily be missing a key part of the discussion. And that’s why I’m here. So, Reddit, can you change my view and help me understand?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
