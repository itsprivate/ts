This concept seems cruel to me for many reasons (assuming parents can afford to still have the kid there):\n\n1. A high school education alone is not enough to get you paid a living wage in many areas of the country. By kicking your child out, they are likely doomed to poverty, at least in the short term.\n\n2. If they try to go to college to get a better job, they will be saddled with student loans and then have rent to pay in top of that. Even if they want to study a trade, they may rack up debt or not have resources to do so. As a result they may not finish school or will be paying off loans for 20 years!\n\n3. My parents never kicked me out. I left a bit after graduating college and getting established in a job. I was able to move out on my own terms and I'm doing great in life. I own a house, have a stable job and good savings, etc. I think I owe a lot of my current stability and success to my parent's support in late teens/early 20s. \n\nIf an 18 year old wants to leave, that's no problem, but they shouldn't be forced to. In today's society you generally need longer to get ready to live independently. CMV",
