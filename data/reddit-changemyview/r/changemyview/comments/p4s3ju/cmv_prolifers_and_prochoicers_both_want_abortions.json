But pro-choicers aren&#39;t &quot;fans&quot; of abortion either, in the sense that nobody particularly thinks of abortion as something tasteful or desirable. In fact, they&#39;d generally prefer that contraception become so widely available, and used, that unwanted pregnancies don&#39;t even <strong>happen</strong> in the first place - thus obviating the need for abortions.</p>\n\n<p>So what <strong>both</strong> sides want is in fact a society in which abortion is vastly reduced. The only difference is <em>how</em> it is reduced, and the philosophy behind it. Pro-lifers want it banned - &quot;women want abortions but can&#39;t get them.&quot; Pro-choicers want it legal, but rarely used - &quot;women can get abortions but don&#39;t need them.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>(Both sides recognize, of course, that a certain small number of abortions are necessary and unavoidable, such as ectopic pregnancy)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
