But for pants, dresses, formalwear - anything where a more precise fit is important and men&#39;s clothing is already sold by real measurements - this needs to change from the current system.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, it would be just like a pair of men&#39;s jeans for example.  None of that &quot;size 4&quot; crap that varies by half a foot from brand to brand.  Just do real measurements.  For dresses, maybe something like bust / waist / hips, and maybe even overall length for people who prefer shopping online and aren&#39;t just holding it up for a quick visual.  </p>\n\n<p>Worst case?  Whatever, keep your bizarre arbitrary sizing, but include the real numbers for <em>that size</em> right on the tag.  Browsing the rack at a store and see a size 10 that you like?  The tag for it should include the real measurements for that particular size 10 garment.  Buying it online?  The product page should have real measurements on it.  And once you commit to a sizing standard for your brand: LEAVE IT.  It&#39;s insane how something from one brand that&#39;s two or three years old could be a drastically different size than something of the &quot;same size&quot; released today.    </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t see a good reason to keep this information hidden or constantly change it, but maybe there&#39;s some crazy factor that has gone completely over my head.  I&#39;m open to hearing why it would be bad to do this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
