I often get comments like “why do you dress like a boy?” And “why can’t you dress up a bit more?”. But I think that it should be completely acceptable for everyone to dress as they like. So I feel like this new non-binary gender identity is making it as if females are not supposed to dress like males and visa Versa. I am a woman and I can dress however I want. To me it almost feels like non-binary is a step backwards for gender equality. Can anyone explain to me why this gender identity is necessary?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
