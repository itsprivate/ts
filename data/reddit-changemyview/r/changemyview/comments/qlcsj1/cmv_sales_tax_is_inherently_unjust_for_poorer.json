While I think income and property taxes is unjust too, that’s not part of this argument since it isn’t unjust to poorer people. </p>\n\n<p>I am talking about essential goods like food, clothing, and other items. I know there are some states that don’t have sales tax for these essential items but others do. And even if it’s not an essential item like a computer why does a poor person have to pay the same tax that jeff brazos would on buying a laptop? There is not correlation on how much you make and how much you pay here. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, I anticipate that some of you will say that rich people buy more expensive items in bigger quantities so they pay more sales tax, but they also get more marginal benefit. It doesn’t change that for the same items they are paying a lesser proportion in taxes then a poor person. In my eyes it works the same way as a speeding ticket where poorer people are affected more. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway change my view.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Rip my comment karma</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
