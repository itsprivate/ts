I know what it’s like to feel silenced or misunderstood by people who disagree with me politically. I’ve felt the frustration of our party (Libertarians) not being allowed on the debate stage, or being told our ideas don’t need to be considered because it doesn’t fit within the left-right paradigm. \n\nBut I’ve never felt like I hated the “other side”. We’re all Americans. Our ship rises or sinks together. That doesn’t mean we don’t fight for our values. But it does mean we present reasoned and rational arguments, with a willingness to change our minds. \n\nMy ideas that I hold are mine, and mine alone. When I go into the grave my ideas will go with me. That’s why I don’t get overly attached to them being the sole correct position of how the world should operate. I believe in my values. But I believe in the rights of others to have values that differ from mine. I also enjoy learning about other people’s opinions on issues. I think criticizing my own ideas sharpens my mind and makes me more knowledgeable about the issues. If someone has a differing opinion, they got their by seeing something I must not have seen. It doesn’t mean I’ll agree. But I assume they’re presenting a legitimate argument based on something they’ve experienced or felt. \n\nThe Democrats and Republicans to me seem to be so obsessed with being correct. They never entertain the idea that they might be wrong. This seems like a dangerous trajectory to be taking. A trajectory that necessarily makes peace impossible. \n\nI’m not saying Libertarians aren’t guilty of these things, we are. But I think because we’re not in a position to actually grasp the wheel of power we can see with more objectivity what this desire to wield power has done to both parties. It’s gone from a genuine belief in debate and rational argumentation. To a hatred of those who disagree.\n\nIt saddens me to see us in this state as a country, and as a union. Part of being a member of a bigger system is understanding the value of compromise. It can’t turn into a battle for the soul of the United States every election cycle. It’s not sustainable, and more importantly it’s not morally right that those who attain power feel the need to “get back” at those who currently don’t have power. \n\nWe’ve been through dark times as a country and as a union. I have faith that the two sides will work it out. I just don’t want to see a situation where we become so morally bankrupt that we would wish failure on each other. \n\nAs a Libertarian (who might run for office one day, once I get more experience and knowledge) I want my philosophy to be one of self reflection and admission of fault. We can’t strengthen ourselves if we become overly resentful of any criticism. \n\nIn a larger sense I question the ends to these means I’ve seen by the Democrats and Republicans. Would ruling over the ashes of the world mean my side somehow “won”? Even if we defeated everyone who disagreed with us, we would be on a planet with a singular point of view. What would be the point in that? Who would we confide in for greater perspective? \n\nIdk of any of this makes sense. It’s just sad where we are now.",
