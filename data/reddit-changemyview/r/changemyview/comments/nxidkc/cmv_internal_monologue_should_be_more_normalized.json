[The scene in question.](https://youtu.be/_W7hIHnYbc8) What was it about that spaghetti-covered baby that changed Hughie's mind? Was it the phrase, \"Keep your hands clean\"?

An example of what I'm talking about would be from David Lynch's Dune: [Gom Jobbar Scene](https://youtu.be/A54yfyi00dI). Throughout that film, several characters have an internal monologue, such as Paul's mother noticing someone else has something on their mind and is holding back information. As problematic as that film can be, I think that's the best feature. Knowing what someone feels is a huge reason why folks who see film adaptions often feel the book was better. \n\nAlso, I want to leave the caveat that this does not really include narration. Narration is a 4th-Wall break, as a character is speaking directly to the audience, and is often done in the past tense. This isn't to say narration is bad (I actually quite like narrators), but that it is functionally different from a character's internal thoughts.",
