  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Now to star I want to clarify what I mean by chivalry. I dont mean treating people with respect or holding the door open, those are just traits of a decent human. What I mean is the man asking the woman out , having to plan the date, pay for it and any further other(since she will hold it againts him if he dosnt) and generally having to ,, woo her,, while she stays passive. The main reason for this post is a coment I read on one of the dating subs(looking trought the controversial section on them is a guilty pleasure when I&#39;m bored). It was a woman comenthing how when a guy dosnt pay for the date he shows that he is cheap and lazy and yet saying that she never pays for a date. This really annoyed me because it really reminds me of ,, modern day femenist,,. I belive that if a woman want equality ( which everyone should want) then she must accept both the benefits and the responsibility that come with it. You cant just say well I reject the gender norms in this and this area since they hinder me but I want to keep them in this and this are since I benefit from them. If you want to be intellectually honest you either chose equality,  both the good and the bad, or choose old school. Meaning that you demand that the guys is the archetype of the old school gentleman, but you also have to be the archetype of the old school woman(staying in the house, cooking, cleaning and taking care of his sexual needs whenever he wants). Now there isnt anything wrong with either of the options( different tastes for different people) but anything in between and your just a hypocrite who wants to have their cake and eat it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
