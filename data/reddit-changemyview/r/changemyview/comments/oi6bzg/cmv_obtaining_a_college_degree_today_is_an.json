College education used to be an investment where you&#39;d see a return in the form of a job/career. I think qualifications for private sector careers are drastically changing. </p>\n\n<p>I read a tweet this morning regarding how Addison Rae had been hired and fired for becoming a UFC correspondent. I can&#39;t imagine the hundreds if not thousands of other applicants who studied years to get into a position like that. To go even further, the Tik-Tok influencer shared a bitter statement on twitter saying that she studied hard for three months to get that position. </p>\n\n<p>Three months??? Are you kidding me?!</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not even a full semester of college. Plus, this 20-year old girl already has a generated net worth of 2 million. It proves to show that landing the career you want is a who-you-know game, rather than what-you-know. I&#39;m happy to see another young kid becoming successful, but seeing news like this makes me feel like obtaining certain careers are impossible. If qualifications for careers aren&#39;t based on a defined set of knowledge, than what is my degree really going towards?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
