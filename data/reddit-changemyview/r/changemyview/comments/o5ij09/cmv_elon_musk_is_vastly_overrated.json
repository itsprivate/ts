And i just dont get the hype, (the spaceX rockets are not bad dont get me wrong), I ( and especially data) tell that they are not that efficient as the majority thinks they are, since the fuel they need to save for landing is obviously lost in flight, so they need more fuel and ,more Important, the last bit of fuel is the most valuable; Also the idea of reusing rockets isnt new, NASA thought about it too they just thought it was too ineffizient for the reasons i wrote before too. Plus Elon Musk seems to be super nice with his Twitter account and all,  but i frequently hear Storys about the working conditions at his facilitys and it doesnt Sound that appealing ngl, also some of the things he did  regarding bitcoin or doge coin resulting in lots of people losing their money, dont really Support that Image of the freaky nice billionair . On the other hand he worked really Hard and somehow he still isnt broke, so i want to understand how you guys think about him.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1) since i got this reply a lot, you guys are right with the low cost per Kilogramm to Orbit. \nI decided to not take on this Argument since SpaceX later on got heavily Funded by NASA, after the invemted the falcon 1 , merlin, Kestrel, and Draco engines.\nI must confess i dont know if they still get an extra amount of money per launch like they Used  to get at least i think they did, so probably the cost per Kilogramm would be much higher if they had higher Research expenses.\n Also i know that getting funded is not unusal in my opinion it just doesnt Match the whole &quot; we /I did it also by myself&quot; image</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
