How many of us have things we deeply regret from years gone by? How many of us would say we have changed significantly in ten years or more? </p>\n\n<p>Slight caveat: I can see why an apology might be necessary, particularly in cases such as hate speech, racism or other disgraceful language or action, but my main point is that this should be the end of it, and not the start of someone being attacked to the point of their reputation being destroyed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
