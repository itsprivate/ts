So now that we've cleared up how effective it can be, let's address the issue of teaching it to students in school.\n\n**Sounds like a waste of time and money right?**\n\nNot really, we already teach physical education to students and I really hope I don't have to explain to you how beneficial exercise can be for physical and psychological well being.\n\n**It's too complicated for kids though, surely?**\n\nNot at all, in fact basic breathing techniques and meditation practices couldn't be any easier to start, here are some lovely British doctors teaching you one you can try right now:\n\n[https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/breathing-exercises-for-stress/](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/breathing-exercises-for-stress/)\n\nAnd here is a quick and easy guide to simple meditation practices that don't require any experience whatsoever:\n\n [https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/) \n\nMeditation is simply a practice of mindfulness and observation. There are many different methods and schools you can practice but even a beginner, with no experience or guidance can take an hour out of their day, sit quietly and comfortably with their eyes closed, observe their breathing and seek awareness of their natural state of physiology.\n\nIt's a vital life skill that we all should learn.\n\nYour academic years are some of the most stressful, painful and challenging years of your life. We should be carefully guiding young people through these times and teaching them skills to help them manage the stress and emotional weight that will otherwise almost certainly scar them in countless ways.\n\nSimple breathing techniques and meditation practices form a key part of this, as part of a revised curriculum geared towards addressing the mental health crisis young people are facing - we need to start teaching this in schools.\n\nI've been (future) Dr. Yasmin and thank you for coming to my TedX talk, one day they'll give me a real Ted talk I promise!\n\nSo how about it? Why shouldn't meditation and breathing techniques form a part of the high school curriculum?",
