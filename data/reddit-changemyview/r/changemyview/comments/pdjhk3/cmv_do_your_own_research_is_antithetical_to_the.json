Idk), we realized that not every single person needs to know every single thing. We can <em>specialize</em> and have jobs in a particular space of knowledge, if we don&#39;t &#39;do our own research&#39; and trust that the society will mitigate our other risks. This specialization of skills/knowledge gives rise to economy, social class, professional subcultures, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In a short, limited example, the farmer doesn&#39;t need to know how to or actually build or repair their own house. The builder doesn&#39;t need to know how to or actually farm crops. They will exchange their services to each other to mitigate each other&#39;s risk, allowing each of them to become better at their specialization. When you scale this example, you see how you now need an economy to be able to efficiently exchange work between mediums. It gives rise to social class as the ones with the most utility (doctor&#39;s, politicians, judges, etc.) can curry the most favour in exchange for their work.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: We see this property being leveraged across multiple facets of nature (biological sex, multicellular organisms). </p>\n\n<p>Basically, society progressed much faster when we were able to centralize meaningfully differentiated skills and knowledge. Of course this does not mean that this system is immune to the typical challenges of centralization (lack of transparency, trust, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>So when I hear &#39;do your own research&#39;, my brain translates it to &#39;There is a significant enough risk that this centralized knowledge/skill base is compromised, that I need to mitigate the primary risk myself&#39;. </p>\n\n<p>Which is a fair thing to say, and act on for a lot of contexts (ie. Journalism/media on political events), but the implication above for such key systems such as healthcare or engineering, is the equivalent of basically trying to mitigate the risk of a total societal collapse/revolution.</p>\n\n<p>It is antithetical to, imo, one of the core reasons for society&#39;s success and state today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
