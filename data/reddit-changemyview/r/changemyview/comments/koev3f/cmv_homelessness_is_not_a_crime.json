Homelessness can be seen as undesired by society, just like extra-judicial violence is.

Obviously there would not be homelessness without homeless people, but without murdered people there also would not be murders. Both groups are victims. \n\nBut if homeless people are not the perpetrators, then who is? Its almost impossible to determine a definitely guilty party here, because the issue has a complex and difficult to entangle web of causes. In a sense, society itself is responsible.\n\nI am not sure what a law violated by society itself would even mean.
