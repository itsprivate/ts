This is the compassionate choice. I&#39;ve seen what happens when people don&#39;t elect for this option. The patient gets sicker, suffering over days or weeks until they eventually die in agony.

We force humans to live in a state of misery until their bodies slowly fall apart on them. If a person who&#39;s reached this state wants to die in peace and prevent further deterioration, that option should be medically available. Everyone should have the option to die with dignity should they so choose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
