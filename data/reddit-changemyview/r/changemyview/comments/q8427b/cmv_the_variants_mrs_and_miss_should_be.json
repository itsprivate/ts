But now it is unnecessarily judgmental that in a wide variety of settings, women are expected to announce their marital status.  And while the use of Miss unnecessarily belittles women as the standard cutoff I have seen is 30, where many women are well into their professional careers by then.  I could see a different set of prefixes for both boys and girls that are cut off around something like 13 as they become teenagers.  Or 18 as legal adults, but this seems like more trouble than it is worth.  </p>\n\n<p>It also makes it very easy to mislabel women as miss and misses can sound similar so when filling out someone’s information it can be easy to mistake them.</p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear any valid reasons for why these various titles should exist.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
