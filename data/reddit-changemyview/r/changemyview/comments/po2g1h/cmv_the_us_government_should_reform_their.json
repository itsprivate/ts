Everything from the big stuff (trillions wasted in Afghanistan, billions spent maintaining federal buildings that are vacant, etc..) down to the smaller stuff like $37 million to help deal with truant Filipino youth, or more than $3 million was spent on sending Russians to American community colleges for a gap year. </p>\n\n<p>This all adds up to an unknown figure. Even worse, is that when researching this, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to even grasp the sheer volume of government waste. It&#39;s trillions of wasted dollars coming from the pockets of US citizens.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear I am NOT against taxes. I think that Corporate taxes should be higher and companies off-shoring profits be held accountable. I am also not completely against income tax, but I believe the US government should reform spending rather than raising taxes. Moreover, I think with proper reform they could effectively lower taxes for lower income Americans to put more money back in their pockets. I do not believe we can tax ourselves to prosperity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
