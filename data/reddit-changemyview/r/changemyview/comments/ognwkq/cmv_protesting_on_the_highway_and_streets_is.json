And example was when a CHP officer speed down the road a little when protesters swarmed his vehicle and he flung one off who tried to climb on top of his vehicle. These kind of situations need to be looked at on a case by case basis. </p>\n\n<p>But in most videos I found the protesters are in the wrong for obstructing traffic, and purposely making the drivers fear for their lives, such as when they throw stuff at them, try to hit or or break their vehicle, or point weapons or start threatening them. </p>\n\n<p>You shouldn’t put yourself in more danger to stop a vehicle from getting through, they are huge Metal machines that weigh a few tons and can go over a hundred miles an hour. It could cause unnecessary injuries to both parties involved. I wouldn’t want to pay hundreds of dollars in hospital bills (at least here in the U.S) because I got in the way of a moving vehicle</p>\n\n<p>And to top it off, most people won’t enjoy being stuck in traffic because protesters blocked the road. It actively hurts recruitment for organizations and protests as your being more annoying then anything else. </p>\n\n<p>Now like I said before these should be done on a case by case situation, and should be looked into thoroughly before making a final decision. But to help Prevent more accidents from happing in the future all you Gotta do is stay out of the road.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
