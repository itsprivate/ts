They will easily outcompete the businesses that are owned by a smaller group of people.</p>\n\n<p>If you have better worker treatment and pay you get a much better talent pool of workers to choose from. Human talent is the most valuable resource on the planet when it comes to business.</p>\n\n<p>I can see the counter argument that the powers that be will not allow it to happen. I say nonsense. I am reminded of Napster the first music sharing service that came out in 1999. Boy how those record labels tried to fight free transfer of music. They eventually killed Napster and even the next iteration which I believe was Limewire. But the technology couldn&#39;t be stopped, nowadays you can listen to whatever song you want for free. Same with these worker co-opts. If they are really that fucking awesome then eventually there will be a country that will have a ton of them. It might take a while but those sort of ideas are pretty much impossible to kill once they have spread. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think that will happen btw. I think worker co-opts are inherently weaker than your standard capitalist companies. Because they are far less flexible. People who would lead the co-opts would be elected. Which means you need someone who is both good at getting votes AND running a business. Most people are good at one or another.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
