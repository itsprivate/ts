While it&#39;s great if the influencer does choose to spread awareness about it, it is stupid that that is the expectation. Remember: these are just people. Regular people, who probably don&#39;t know everything going on in the world. Believe it or not, they&#39;re not these all-mighty people sent to save the world.</p>\n\n<p>This pressure probably does more harm than good. So now these people are forced to speak about something before they don&#39;t even fully understand so they don&#39;t get harassed? What good does that do? </p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t encourage influencers to spread awareness, do fundraisers, and all that. That&#39;s amazing. But if they&#39;re already doing some, that <em>is</em> enough. They&#39;re not here to solve every world issue. If that&#39;s what you wanna do, great. But they&#39;re here to entertain you. A 15 year old Tiktoker or gamer YouTuber shouldn&#39;t be expected to be educated on everything going on in the world enough able to speak about all of them, sorry.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
