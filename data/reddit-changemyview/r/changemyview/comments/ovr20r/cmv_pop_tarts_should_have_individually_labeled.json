I’ve been polite in my responses but I’m still getting downvoted. Sorry, but my mind has not been changed. I understand the reasons why making this change might be difficult, and I know how I can solve the breakfast roulette problem by labeling myself, but the opinion or view was that the food simply should be labeled like other individually packaged foods are. Thank you for the responses.</em></p>\n\n<p>Original post:\nI enjoy Pop Tarts in general but I’m not into all of the flavors that my family enjoys. For me Pop Tarts are great if they are fruit based but taste like super sweet hot toaster cake if they are one of the chocolate ones. To each their own, if that’s your bliss chase it, just not my thing.</p>\n\n<p>Once you take Pop Tarts out of the box they are indistinguishable from one another. Just a silver sleeve with a mystery inside.</p>\n\n<p>Once you open that mystery sleeve you have approximately 14 seconds to either toast it, eat it cold, or repackage before it starts to go stale.</p>\n\n<p>CMV: It’s ridiculous that Pop Tarts aren’t individually labeled out of the box. In my view it does not make sense for this one product to have non-descriptive packaging when other snacks do have such packaging. I don’t know who made the call to have non-descriptive packaging but I disagree with them. That’s my view. Food should have descriptive packaging both in and out of box. (Or clear packaging I suppose) </p>\n\n<p><strong>More ETA:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people are replying with solutions to the problem or going into details regarding cost for the manufacturers but not explaining why Pop Tarts shouldn’t be labeled. You buy granola bars and dump them out-all labeled. You buy microwave popcorn and dump out the contents, each bag is labeled. I’m not saying that there wouldn’t be a cost to making a change or that I am not able to label them myself. The view is that Pop Tarts <em>should</em> be individually labeled like other snacks are.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don’t want to keep them in the box due to space constraints. (Old house, very narrow cabinets) It is easier to have them in the snack bin. I’ve seen other people do this but they tend to buy just one flavor.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, I could label them myself. Totally valid. But this post isn’t about a workaround, it is about my belief that Kellogg’s should do this and has no (good) reason not to.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don’t understand what makes Pop Tarts different from, for example, granola bars. You open up a box of Nature Valley or Nutri-Grain bars and you get individually wrapped and labeled snacks. Twinkies come in clear packaging. Why is this not the case with Pop Tarts??</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Edited original post to clarify view is about descriptive packaging not about ways to fix this problem for just myself)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
