Its dead.&#39; is such an unexpected gut punch every time.</p>\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that its a format that&#39;s almost certainly being farmed for Karma, every one gets massive amounts of upvotes and awards, and its not even &#39;expected&#39; that the picture/video/whatever has <em>anything to do with the pet getting old or dying.</em> A gif of a kitten stumbling around will catch you upside the head with its title describing the poor thing getting run over, and get 10k upvotes! </p>\n\n<p>I kind of get why people post these sincerely in the first place, and I understand why people upvote them, (even if I think giving strangers fake internet points to make them feel better is kind of dumb, personally) but I cant help but wish they were banned (edit; in lighthearted, feel-good subs) or at least a lot less popular so I wouldn&#39;t see them ALL THE TIME.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
