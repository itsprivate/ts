But for the sake of this post, I&#39;m talking about Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden. Which I think puts me in a good position to piss off a lot of people. Only joking, I hope we can discuss this in a levelheaded manner. My argument behind this is simple, all of these presidents have committed war crimes which murdered civilians. I know that a lot of people don&#39;t think about the drone strikes we do, because it happens so often that many have become numb to it at this point but all of these presidents have murdered multiple times through usage of drones.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what good they might have done aside from this, with any other person we wouldn&#39;t be okay with murder regardless of what else they&#39;ve done otherwise. If a guy spends 10 years donating all their money to charity and then police find their spouse chopped up in the freezer, no one would dare suggest that they he deserves less punishment and especially wouldn&#39;t suggest they should be let go. The act of murder is still murder, regardless. So why should US Presidents be held to a different standard? </p>\n\n<p>Sources:\n[Bush] <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/drone-war/data/the-bush-years-pakistan-strikes-2004-2009\">https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/drone-war/data/the-bush-years-pakistan-strikes-2004-2009</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush\">Obama</a>\n<a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/5/8/18619206/under-donald-trump-drone-strikes-far-exceed-obama-s-numbers\">Trump</a>\n<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/08/u-s-strikes-suspected-suicide-bombers-in-kabul.html\">Biden</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
