  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay, let&#39;s say you get an email from someone named &quot;Steven&quot;. What are Steven&#39;s pronouns? I&#39;m gonna guess they&#39;re probably &quot;he/him&quot;. Now, it&#39;s possible that Steven is actually a ciswoman. After all, I have known women named Michael and even met several cis men named Maria. So it&#39;s not like it&#39;s impossible for a ciswoman with &quot;she/her&quot; pronouns to be named Steven. Or Elliot (Scrubs!!!) And then there are ambiguous names like DJ, Terry, Shawn or perhaps names that someone would be reasonably unfamiliar with (my mother&#39;s name was Chassye, and I&#39;ve met the occasional Dashonta or Luree). So I guess in those cases, you probably should include just if you wanna avoid awkwardness when someone gets your pronouns wrong. </p>\n\n<p>But like, come on. If your name is Ronald, we probably don&#39;t need you to explicitly state your pronouns. We can safely assume that Sandra is a &quot;she/her&quot;, and if they&#39;re not, then I can see why you&#39;d wanna include pronouns. But I think it should be like this:</p>\n\n<p>Obvious male name belonging to a he/him = no need for pronouns</p>\n\n<p>Obvious female name belonging to a she/her = no need for pronouns</p>\n\n<p>Ambiguous or uncommon name = include pronouns</p>\n\n<p>Obvious gendered name belonging to someone who does not match the obvious gender = include pronouns</p>\n\n<p>Working in a foreign country where they probably have never seen your name = include pronouns</p>\n\n<p>I feel bad saying this cuz I&#39;ve added a &quot;he/him&quot; to my email sig and I use it a lot in my working life (zoom calls and stuff) but I feel like my name is a fairly common male name that no one could reasonably get my pronouns wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not opposed to doing this. I voluntarily added my pronouns to my work stuff, in spite of slight jabs from coworkers who tease me for it (they&#39;re all old school backwards types who believe in binary gender). So I support doing it. I&#39;m just wondering why I do it.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I am not a backwards, old school gender binary type. I understand that gender is not the same as biological sex, and I&#39;ve had a relationship with a trans woman, and I support people being who they are and I&#39;ve even marched alongside LGBT folks at rallies before. </p>\n\n<p>I just think the pronoun thing is sorta silly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, someone is gonna have to tell me how to type a Delta on my phone in case I need to award one (I suspect I will).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
