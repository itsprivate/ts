For example, you film a video with your camera your camera doesn&#39;t experience the video, but when you look through your eyes you do.</p>\n\n<p>If a scientist would 3D print a human who is 100% functional except for its brain. His heart is pumping his cells are replicating, but he doesn&#39;t have a brain, when you touch him, he doesn&#39;t experience anything, because it cannot be registered in the brain, this is an example of a living being without sentience and I can&#39;t see any reason why it would be immoral for the scientist to kill this being. The same applies to most fetuses, they haven&#39;t developed a brain that has the capacity to experience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232061401_When_is_the_Capacity_for_Sentience_Acquired_During_Human_Fetal_Development\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232061401_When_is_the_Capacity_for_Sentience_Acquired_During_Human_Fetal_Development</a></p>\n\n<p>According to this article, the lower bar of sentience is 30 weeks, it could be different and therefore I think that we should do more research on this subject, it would be best to shorten the legality to shorter than this 30 week period because we could be a bit off.</p>\n\n<p>But I think we can safely assume that sentience definitely does not fall within the first trimester.</p>\n\n<p>You can choose however you want to convince me that first-trimester abortions aren&#39;t moral.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
