So, please forgive me if this does not make much sense and please know that I'm more than ready to change my view, or at least have it adjusted.  \n\nAnyway, it seems to me that a lot of American media has no idea what \"far-left\" means.  Here's an article from [*Newsweek*](https://www.newsweek.com/real-radicals-arent-washington-opinion-1591769) (since when is *Newsweek* like *Fox News*, by the way?) talking about \"far-left\" billionaire George Soros.  \n\nFar-left billionaire?  That's like having a Nazi rabbi.  You can't be far-left and a billionaire.  If you are truly *far*\\-left, then you oppose private property and seek the overthrow of existing systems of power.  There cannot be a \"far-left\" billionaire.  Billionaires are by definition members of the exploiting class.  \n\nSimilarly, there cannot be a \"far-left\" Hollywood or Silicon Valley agenda.  Hollywood and Silicon Valley exist to cash-in on on vanity and narcissism.  They are the antithesis of far-leftism.  \n\nI would admit that Hollywood writers, Silicon Valley moguls and certain billionaire financiers are *liberals,* and that they use their considerable power and influence to oppose traditional interpretations of sexuality, gender and race.  I would also concede that this probably infuriates a lot of religious and nationalist conservatives but this does not make them \"far-left\". \n\nIn fact, true \"radical leftists\" would oppose identity politics outright and would see it as something conjured up by elites to distract the working classes from their blatant exploitation by profit-driven capitalists.   \n\nI'm pretty sure I have this right.  I'm not saying where I stand on any of these issues but can anyone honestly say that a true \"far-leftist\" would support anything produced by media conglomerates, tech magnates and billionaire financiers?
