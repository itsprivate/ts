I just feel that women's sport would be more commercially viable if more women were demanding to consume that kind of content, regardless of the sport being played.

Where the career opportunity to become a sports women in some sports doesn't pay off, so women are discouraged from that path and as such, fewer women become interested in supporting or playing sport?
