Businesses around the country are now facing a choice: pay more than my competitor down the road and take his employees, or shut the doors. This is exactly what the left has been after all along, only this time, it&#39;s being driven naturally.</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add clarification...\nI wasn&#39;t very clear with my post above, so I&#39;m adding to it for clarification. My original post remains untouched.</p>\n\n<p>The point of my post is that very low unemployment will naturally increase wages. This is a result of having less labor in a market than demand for labor. Our current situation is far from natural; it was created by government overreach in shutting down our economy and increasing unemployment benefits. With that said, the end result is the same; there is less labor in the market than demand for labor.</p>\n\n<p>Even with a different cause, the effect (labor shortage) remains the same, and is showing to be a driving factor is a rising wage. Those companies that can remain profitable by increasing their wage have done so. Those that can&#39;t are struggling.</p>\n\n<p>While the cause of the labor shortage is not natural, the effect of a labor shortage remains unchanged.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
