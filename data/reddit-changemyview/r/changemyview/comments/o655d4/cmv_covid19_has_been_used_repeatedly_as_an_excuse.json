For example normal store fronts would have you purchase a product, take if home, find out it’s defective and rather than offering an exchange, they would ask you to deal remotely with the manufacturer resulting in 3 hour+ hold times and numerous months for replacement which still had to be shipped to store fronts. This is just a common example I’ve seen. </p>\n\n<p>Covid is coming to a close and companies are still practicing this level of laziness. I think the new normal is going to be garbage customer service and sky high prices. We have nobody to blame but ourselves and we should have driven the offending businesses out of business for such practices. </p>\n\n<p>If you yourself have any examples of this please speak up because I’m struggling to recall every example I’ve seen since March 2020.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
