Women entering the workforce has the same effect.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why growth has stalled: huge amounts of old people need their retirement and healthcare taken care of which requires huge amounts of cash not going into other parts of the economy</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why workers&#39; rights have stalled: more supply of workers from abroad.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why working class jobs don&#39;t pay well and sustain a family anymore: someone abroad can do it for cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s where your problems come from.
