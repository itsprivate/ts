I think it might also cut down on officers that feel like they need to use additional force because they cannot properly restrain or run down suspects. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t apply to people working in offices. This is for active duty situations. This is also not meant to be discriminatory towards certain body types, there are just better positions suited for people whose health could be at risk or who may not be able to perform to the best of their abilities. </p>\n\n<p>I’m interested to hear what everyone has to say!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
