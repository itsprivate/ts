They found that women were not passing at the same rates as men, so they are considering lowering the bar / changing the tests that women do. I feel like this is a bad thing for 2 main reasons.\n\n1. The fitness test getting easier means less fit people in the army which means a less qualified army, could lead to more deaths. I have no evidence of this, just seems like it would happen.\n2. Everyone should be on an even playing field. If it's sexist to say that women are not as fit as men, it should be sexist to propose lowering the bar for women too, right? I'm not sure if I'm sexist for saying women should take the same tests, or sexist for saying they should take an easier one.\n\nSo they had two options from what I can tell; either accept that not as many women will pass as men (which might lead to really bad PR when some news outlet 'exposes' the military for letting men in more than women) or lower the bar (which might lead to really bad PR when some news outlet 'exposes' the military for suggesting that women need different tests).\n\nI'm not sure there's a good option here. IMO they should keep the tests the same.\n\nTalking about the Army ACFT fitness test here.\n\nEDIT: My view was changed. The point of this test isn't \"this is the bar you need to meet so you don't get your fellow servicefolk killed\". The test is more \"You should be a healthy person\" and a healthy female and a healthy male have different strengths and weaknesses so they should have different tests. I still maintain that the standards for specific roles such as infantrypersons should remain equal because the purpose of those standards is for the safety of the servicefolk.\n\nEDIT 2: Not sure if my view has been changed. I've been getting conflicting information from people and took their word for it potentially mistakenly. I need to better educate myself on the ACTF and overall how the army works / sets their standards. Perhaps you guys can debate it amongst yourselves some more but I need to read for a while. \n\nI maintain a belief that for specific roles where we need to set a bar for the safety of everyone, that bar should be the same regardless of gender. I'm not sure if there's any specific tests for specific roles that have different standards for men and women.",
