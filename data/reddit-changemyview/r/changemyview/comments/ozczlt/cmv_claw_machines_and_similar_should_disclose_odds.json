IIRC claw machines work by only grabbing the toy at full strength a fraction of the time to ensure that the machine earns a profit. If, for example, the machine grabs the toy at full strength 1/1000 times, then my view is that the probability should be disclosed on the machine itself (like a little sticker or something to say that you have a 1/1000 chance to win the toy on the machine itself, just to know what you&#39;re up against).</p>\n\n<p>Currently my main issue with these machines is that if theres a chance to win a prize at all, then I have no idea what it is. Knowing whether I have a 1/500 or 1/1000 chance would at least clarify to me how likely it is that I would win a prize.</p>\n\n<p>It just seems wrong that these machines seem to be marketed as prizes which you could win if you&#39;re good enough at the game, when in reality its just a microchip that decides the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I didnt make this clear, but I only want the chances of the RNG for claw strength disclosed. I understand that some of the machine is going to be based on luck or skill that may not be predictable by the machine, but I do want the user to know how likely they are to lose to a RNG</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
