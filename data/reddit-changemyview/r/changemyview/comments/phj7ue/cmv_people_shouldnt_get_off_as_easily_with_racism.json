Maybe you’ve been in a conversation about spicy food and someone brought up how white people have low spice tolerances. The ironic thing is that you might hear those same people talk about racist stereotypes and how they’re false (an example would be the stereotype of how black people can’t swim). </p>\n\n<p>I mean, people of other races can make as many racist comments about white people but as soon as a white person (or really anyone tbh) makes a comment about ANY race they are labeled as racist. </p>\n\n<p>I know I’m not the only one who has noticed this double standard. I don’t see how my perspective could be changed, which is why I need your help for me change it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
