  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I mean the issue is that multiple choice oftentimes encourage students to cram, memorize and regurgitate rather then learn. In certain subjects multiple choice is fine when you cannot just come to the correct answer by guessing or using process of elimination (or by memorizing everything before the test and regurgitating it on the test).</p>\n\n<p>I feel that multiple choice tests doesn&#39;t necessarily measure how well you&#39;re learning as well as how deep you&#39;re learning. It does not necessarily tell you how well you&#39;re able to apply the info or to seen connections between pieces of information. It does not tell you whether or not you have the skill set of applying the info or to figure things out. All because you score well on a multiple choice test doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you understood the information or actually learned the info well. Learning involves the ability to apply and see connections, or to have a deep understanding over the issue or else you aren&#39;t actually learning (instead you&#39;re just memorizing).</p>\n\n<p>So to sum it all up, it does necessarily provide students a way of demonstrating their knowledge and what they&#39;re learning. It does not measure understanding, instead it measures memorization.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is theirs&#39;s a higher chance that a person would be able to guess things correct based on intuition and process of elimination. For example a lot of multiple choice tests has only a limited amount of answers and the person could easily eliminate some of them due to how silly they are. Because of the limited amount of answers their&#39;s a higher chance for a person to guess something correct.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple choice tests also doesn&#39;t necessarily even measure how well you retain info, as sometimes you can answer a question correct with only a vague memory of something and the answers provided that you have to choose from may provide a hint to the true answer of the question.</p>\n\n<p>I think tests should be more short answer and analysis and less multiple choice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
