But even when I try to make an appeal coming from that position, it just falls on deaf ears.\n\nEven if I did believe that this whole pandemic was overblown or some kind of elaborate hoax or conspiracy (just to be extra clear I absolutely do not believe that) I still would like to think that I would at least begrudgingly follow the rules out of courtesy for other's to put their minds at ease.\n\nAs far as I've seen, any claims about actual medical conditions or arguments saying that masks reduce oxygen etc. have been thoroughly shown to be absolute bullshit time and time again. And don't even get me started on people who just can't deal with the discomfort of wearing masks in general, news flash: no one enjoys it but it's just how it is.\n\nAll of that being said, if there are any actual legitimate points against any of this I genuinely want to hear them. I feel like it's important that I know in case I do find myself in a situation where I am wrong about this, regardless of the requirements set by my employer. So if you've got em' please do share.",
