There is a tipping culture here in the UK, but as we receive standard min wage, the &#39;expected&#39; tip is generally around 10%. I spent 10y in the hospo industry as a waitress/bartender, and during that time would receive a moderate amount of tips - but only ever in response to good or extra attentive service.</p>\n\n<p>Spent a few months in the States a few years back, and was immediately struck by how different the tipping culture is. On the one hand, I totally appreciate that throwing your bartender a big tip after the first round will get you better service moving forwards, on the other, just don&#39;t really understand how you should expect to be ignored if you don&#39;t have the wherewithal to throw down an extra ten bucks at the start of your night.</p>\n\n<p>I had a few waitresses who were downright rude throughout the meal, then still made snide comments at the end when they didn&#39;t feel they&#39;d been tipped enough. In the UK, if you&#39;re rude or you fuck up, you don&#39;t expect to get tipped. Appreciate that this is likely not the norm, and there are probably numerous servers out there who work with the inherent shittiness of garbage wages subsidised with tips, but surely the goal here is to behave like a professional regardless of whether or not you can expect a payout.</p>\n\n<p>Idk, interested to hear views on this. I just don&#39;t feel like there are many other scenarios other than in the service industry where I, as a waitress, could act like a prick to a customer all night and then expect to be paid extra for it.</p>\n\n<p>(edit for spelling)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
