Now, realistically, you’re not going to really get much more out from using one of these gadgets. I’ll be generous again and say it saves you 5% of each tube. </p>\n\n<p>12 tubes * $3 * 5% = $1.80 in savings per year. </p>\n\n<p>These products are mostly in the $5-10 range. If you purchase one of these for $5, it would take you almost 3 years for the amount you save to equal the price you paid. If you spent $10 on one, it would take 5 and a half years. If you manage to keep this cheap piece of plastic for 25 years without it breaking, you will save a whopping $40. However, I highly doubt it would it would last more than a couple of years at most.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
