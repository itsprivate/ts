  "selftext": "A common trend I have been noticing for a while is that when an old social media post by a celebrity is unearthed and the story makes the news, mainstream media outlets typically do not actually include the posts in question in their articles. The article might say something like '*X* posted several tweets from 2012-14', or '*X* has apologised for their comments', and may include comments from other people in response to the original offending posts, but the posts themselves are typically not included. In my opinion, this is extremely unhelpful and failing to fulfil a pretty basic requirement of being a news outlet. If the focus of the article is what the person has said, then surely including what they actually said is pretty essential. And how are readers supposed to know how to feel about the comments or the commenter if they don't know what they've actually said?\n\nThere may be an argument in favour of omitting the comments on the grounds that the media outlets do not want to provide a 'platform' or be otherwise associated with crude or offensive language. But this standard only seems to really apply to archaic social media posts. If, for example, a famous person made crude/offensive comments today in an interview or press conference, most media outlets would report what they said verbatim. Indeed, even *current* social media posts by famous people don't get this treatment. For example, here's a BBC article from 2019 about [the rugby player Israel Folau's homophobic post on Instagram](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48306223). The article quotes the post verbatim. Meanwhile, here is a recent article from the BBC about cricketer [Ollie Robinson being suspended for historical racist and sexist tweets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/57379184). This article does not make any mention of the exact content of Robinson's tweets.\n\nThe best thing IMO would be for the media to include the original posts in their reports. If necessary, they can add some kind of warning that the content may be upsetting, or a disclaimer that these views do not represent the views of the outlet in question (although I sort of assumed all quotes in news reports came with that implication anyway), but reporting in as much detail and with as much accuracy as possible seems like a pretty basic part of publishing any form of news.",
