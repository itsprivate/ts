In this example the transgender person has really transitioned well; they look convincingly like the gender they align with. If these two people met and had sexual intercourse, but at no point before did the transexual person disclose that they were transexual, I think this would be a breach of consent. Many people would consent to having sex with a biological female and not a transgender one. We usually base our assumptions of someone's sex on their appearance. If someone has made efforts to appear to be another sex, they should disclose this otherwise it voids the implied consent we give when we believe we are having biological male to female sex. Same way I think failing to disclose you're married voids consent. I'm not proposing that this is rape, I'm just suggesting it's wrong.",
