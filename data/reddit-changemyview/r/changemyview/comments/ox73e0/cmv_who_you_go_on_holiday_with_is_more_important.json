  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Even if you go to your dream country, a lavish resort or a big vibrant city, your company matters. Imagine going on holiday with a bunch of people who have a list that includes everything they wish to do, but you disagree with it and would rather roam around the place spontaneously (or vice versa). You may want to relax and enjoy the holiday. These disagreements can be incredibly infuriating, and might potentially just ruin the vacation.    </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the age difference is an issue too. Parents and children may inevitably have different definitions of fun, as adults are more likely to enjoy sightseeing, whereas children would prefer games and activities. It&#39;s likely for the children to start using electronics rather than enjoying the scenery because to them it is boring, which could anger the parents. I&#39;m not generalising them, but you cannot expect people not to complain if you do not include other people&#39;s wishes and desires. These clashes just make the entire experience exhausting. </p>\n\n<p>This is why it is necessary to stop and think about the people you are going with. Sure, you can argue that you should sort this out beforehand or that holidays are about making memories, but if there are people unwilling to compromise then it&#39;s probably best not to go. Plus, there is no point in making memories if you won&#39;t look back on them fondly. You should be sure about the people you go with, otherwise, you will be more excited to come back home, when holidays are supposed to be a break. </p>\n\n<p>After going with family (and sometimes family friends), I probably only have one or two vacations that I&#39;m looking back on fondly because I prefer relaxation but was instead dragged around in 40-degree heat weather to explore the place, whilst waking up at 6 am. Even though it was Spain and the weather was beautiful, the people ruined the experience, and your company is what matters the most.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
