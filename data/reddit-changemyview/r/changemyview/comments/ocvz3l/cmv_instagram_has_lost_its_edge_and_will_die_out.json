Users use it because they want to see photos and engage with them. However, Instagram is now moving to attempt to compete with YouTube and TikTok, which will ultimately fail because those platforms are already occupying their respective niches, and doing a good job at it.</p>\n\n<p>Two - Instagram isn&#39;t showing people what they want to see</p>\n\n<p>I believe that most casual users of Instagram are like myself - we follow pages that we want to use, which usually includes our friends and pages of interest that we are interested in. Instagram&#39;s attempt to push people to look at pages that they don&#39;t even follow at the expense of pages that they do is driving users away and lowering users&#39; interest in the platform.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, I think that Instagram will eventually die out, and pretty soon at that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
