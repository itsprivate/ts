That seems logical, for whatever reason, you don&#39;t like gay people, doesn&#39;t mean that I will agree with you or your view, but, if you don&#39;t hurt anyone with your idea and principles or even reduce the rights of other people, I won&#39;t have an issue with you.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, if homophobic people are closeted gays that implies that they are worse than non-gay when it comes to tolerance of sexual preferences, since they hate themselves and people like them. </p>\n\n<p>And thirdly, let&#39;s say that you are homophobic and not gay. Do you think being called a closeted gay makes you feel better about the LGBT cause? Wouldn&#39;t it make you feel even worse and hate them even more? </p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t see how you can portray this as something that should use to criticize others. I find it an extremely bad argument and doesn&#39;t help absolutely anyone, it doesn&#39;t help the cause for gay (LGBT) rights or helps others being more tolerant to each other preferences.</p>\n\n<p>I would love to discuss this with you since I don&#39;t see any point that makes this argument favourable to anybody.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
