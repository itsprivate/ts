A man is worth two women in testimony. True or false?\n2. A man can have more than 1 wife but a woman cannot have more than 1 husband. Why?\n3. Paradise. I as a man get whatever I want, including eternal erections, women to sleep with but my wife gets nothing? Does she just watch while I have all the fun?\n4. Why are women so condemned in Islam? The punishment for not covering your hair in hell is hanging and so forth. It generally seems like women are unlucky.\n5. Muhammad. I'm not going to go in to Aishas age and the wars because those were the doings of that time. My issue with Muhammad however is that he was very sexually motivated. Of all the books I read, Muhammad seems to be the only one who was so focused on sex or more or less had the focus on him. He slept with many women and was said to have extremely good vitality in bed. Why is this of any importance?\n\nPlease I'd love to have someone answer these points.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit,\nSorry for not responding asap, I can't keep up. Will do my best when I access a computer soon.",
