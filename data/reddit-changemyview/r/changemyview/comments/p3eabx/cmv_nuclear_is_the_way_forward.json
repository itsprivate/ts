It is the only energy source we have right now that is reliable AND carbon neutral. It may not be perfect as it produces nuclear waste which is harmful to the environment however there are currently technologies being produced at the moment that let us harness more energy from the waste. Add on the fact that waste is very safely stored in waste depositories I believe that the risk outweighs the benefit.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no ways anyone can justify non renewable energy instead of nuclear energy but you could try and argue renewable sources such as wind and solar. To this I would argue that there is no reliable way to implement this on a scale to make significant changes too the rate of global warming as we don’t have batteries advanced enough to retain power for cloudy days, thus making it unreliable  .</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
