Well on the news section of reddit, you will be forward posts from r/politics, which has one opinion that you can either agree with or be shunned. Don’t like what’s being posted on r/conservative? Too bad. They’re gonna come up whether you like them or not. I think telling reddit what we’d like to see also should come with the customizability to tell them what we don’t want to see. \n\nSometimes the news feeds of certain subs are littered with links to sites that have paywalls, and if I’m always being recommended posts from these subs, it can be irritating. \n\nWe talk about the dangers of eco chambers, but Reddit’s downvote system only serves to punish descent, so its not as though reddit isn’t a cluster of echo chambers. There is just the illusion that we deserve our fate for saying unpopular things.

Its fine to say that’s if you are in a sub that is a support group for something, you would want to keep certain people, who are sure to exacerbate things, from posting there. So why not afford people, who are trying to keep their feed free of the negativity and vitriol of our current environment from that, for the purposes of their mental health? \n\nI understand that we should allow ourselves to be exposed to ideas with which we disagree, and that it is healthy to be open to different points of view, but if you can’t challenge your ideas by engaging in debate, you’re just going to get entrenched. We need the ability to talk things out rather than just be talked at, but since we’re not going to magically make everyone on reddit civil, maybe we can just have the ability to turn off certain subs, and better control our own experience.\n\n[edit] Thanks for the comments! I have to stress though that this wasn’t “how to” request. I think this should be an official Reddit feature. I think Reddit should allow it on principle.
