There was a premeditated assembly of armed people at the Capitol, whose purpose there was to forcibly overthrow the elected government and Constitution of the United States by stopping Congress and the Vice President from executing their duties under the 12th amendment.  They sought through the use of force including the planned killing of the Speaker of the House and the Vice President to put down the duly elected government and compel the installation of Donald Trump as President, contrary to the laws of the United States.\n\nWhat's the best case that, at least for those people who planned to go into the Capitol and brought weapons to do so.  This would include the person (still at large) who set pipe bombs, as well as [the guy who brought 2 handguns, a rifle, and 11 Molotov cocktails to the capitol.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/alabama-man-charged-possession-eleven-molotov-cocktails-found-near-protest-us-capitol)\n\n---\n\n^1 It's the 1800s so they're gonna speak like that.",
