And yes, the thought behind it I can agree with in that a lot of people are struggling to makes ends meet and this would be a way to help those people. The problem with this in my opinion, is that in turn it hurts small businesses that may not be able to afford to pay everyone $15 an hour so they cut workers, or raise the prices of their goods. I don't want this to sound like I'm not compassionate, because I am, but a lot of minimum wage jobs aren't meant for people to make careers out of, the intent is that they get their foot in the door and move on to bigger and better things. UBI would unencumber the businesses from yet more regulation. I'm not talking about businesses such as Walmart, Amazon etc. these companies could easily raise the wage to much higher and be fine. I guess what I'm getting at, is a lot of jobs are automated already, and more jobs are going to go away in favor of automation. Raising the minimum wage, will actually put more people out of work, doesn't take into account cost of living in various places, and hurts small businesses. The fewer small businesses we have, the less competition there is for the big guys. First time posting on this thread, and genuinely looking for discussion and civil discourse. I've seen articles/research supporting both sides of this coin btw. Thanks in advance!",
