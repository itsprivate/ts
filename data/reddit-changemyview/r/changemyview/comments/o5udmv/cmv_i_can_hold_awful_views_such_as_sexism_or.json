Basically, if someone is ugly, then I’ll be slightly out off by that, but I won’t actually do anything mean because of it.

I’m going to sleep now. My takeaways are that the person might not be able to always think through the situation in time, and the method might not be very good for practising in the real world. I’ll check back in the morning, but I would also like to apologise before I go. I think I formatted the post pretty badly, as well as getting sucked into a tangent argument, meaning that I didn’t get my point across very well, and then reinforced the wrong point in the comments. By this stage, it’s a bit late to fix, but I should have focused more on the hypothetical ethics rather than the actual feasibility of doing this. If you still want to reply whilst I’m asleep, please focus on the ethics. Should the person be penalised for holding the views if they don’t matter?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
