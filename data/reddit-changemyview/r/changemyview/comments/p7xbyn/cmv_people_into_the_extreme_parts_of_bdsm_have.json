At first it seemed kind of erotic, but then I realized how dark it has gotten. It’s not just leather and spanking anymore lol. I wish you people could have seen my face at the question, “have you ever heard of consensual, non consensual sex?” I straight up told her I will not participate in a rape fantasy. She went on and on how it isn’t that bad. </p>\n\n<p>All of the humiliation, degradation, pain isn’t normal in my opinion. Especially the rape fantasy part. You can call me a prude or whatever and that’s fine. I’m not talking about every aspect of BDSM either.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I forgot to add in the title “seems to have a mental illness”. Seems like a critical piece to forget but let me say it here first. No, I’m not a qualified person to be diagnosing mental disorders.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
