For employees, it&#39;s distressing to see armed mobs destroying their workplace, especially because they don&#39;t know that the armed mob won&#39;t hurt them. And people have gotten hurt before during these smash and grabs. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the executives and CEOs of these major companies are far away from the crimes being committed, so if this is supposed to be retaliation against them for mistreating employees (or if people think what is happening is OK because of past wrongdoing, it&#39;s very misguided seeing as employees are the ones getting hurt. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t understand why so many people are jumping to the defense of the criminals vandalizing stores, so maybe I can find out how somebody who is defending them views the situation and, possibly, change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
