It seems to me that it is doing a disservice to women and men, creating a bigger rift and more polarization. It often paints out men as being retarded and violent, as if the only place we should be at is in jail.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, there is sometimes good and wholesome content there, but it is drowned in toxic anti-intellectual and anti-femlnist idiocracy. It seems to me like these women are insecure and are in need of emergency help.</p>\n\n<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
