I have heard people say &quot; WeLl iF yOu ArE pOor ThAT doEsNt jUStify sTeAling&quot;, and i consider that bullshit cause, being really poor can also justify stealing in some conditions, if a homeless child steals one apple to steal alive, that isn&#39;t wrong, human life values a lot more than an apple, if a person steals a loaf of bread to feed his family, it&#39;s not something wrong, because again, human life values a lot more than a loaf of bread. So yes, i think stealing can be justified if the person they&#39;re stealing from isn&#39;t poor himself, also don&#39;t get me wrong, i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good thing to steal but if someone&#39;s life depends on it, it can be justified. And for piracy, of course someone&#39;s life doesn&#39;t depend on watching movies, but i think if a poor person pirates some movie, it can lead to that person support the industry when he&#39;s able to, that can also lead to free marketing some people are not able to pay for entertainment and i think it&#39;s OK to pirate as long as it&#39;s not possible to pay, of course as long as they choose to pay when they have the ability to. And also I&#39;ve heard people say &quot; eNtertAinMEnt iS a LuXurY&quot;, and my answer to that is, what does a rich kid do to deserve to have that luxury that a poor broke kid doesn&#39;t? The answer is, nothing, it just depended on their luck. So yes i think pirating can be justified as long as the person pays for it when they can</p>\n\n<p>2- legally paying for entertainment doesn&#39;t always support the creators. Half the time that you buy something, the money doesn&#39;t actually really go to the actual creators, usually the big company receives the money and not the actual creators. And that happens a lot especially in the Anime/manga industry. The industry has been growing, and that growth leads to more money for the creators, so why are animators still underpaid af? I think when a big company doesn&#39;t pay their employees enough, they deserve their products pirated, at least until they decide to change</p>\n\n<p>3- it may be impossible to pay for entertainment. You might be confused, this is more of a personal reason but it&#39;s literally impossible for people such as me to pay for entertainment legally. So let me explain, i live in Iran, and in Iran, international banking doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s not possible for an iranian person to pay for any service that&#39;s outside of iran, and there&#39;s no service that legally sells entertainment products like movies and animes, even the big streaming services pirate their stuff, so yeah it&#39;s impossible for me to pay for something like Netflix. Also most of the entertainment services have banned iran, so doesn&#39;t that mean they don&#39;t want our money? And also it is possible to buy games, but they are so expensive that it&#39;s possible to pay the rent with the money </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say, i might be a bit biased, keep in mind that these are my opinions and i don&#39;t count them as objective facts</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
