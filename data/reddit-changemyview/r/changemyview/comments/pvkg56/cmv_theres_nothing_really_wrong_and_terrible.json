All animals have to work and hunt to be able to live, it seems to me that that is the natural order of things. Though I absolutely think if/when it is achievable it would be awesome to not have to work to live, I don’t understand the outrage and the idea that this isn’t the most normal way for things to be - e.g people that say that the government should cover all the basics like food, water, and shelter to an extent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
