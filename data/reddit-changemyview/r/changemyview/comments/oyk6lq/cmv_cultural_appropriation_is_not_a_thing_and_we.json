It&#39;s typically some SJW with nothing else to worry about.</p>\n\n<p>True &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; would be if one culture took on a trait of another culture, claimed they invented it, and maybe also prevent the original from expressing it. That would be offensive to the original culture, but I haven&#39;t seen an example of that.</p>\n\n<p>However, the activity I&#39;ve seen labeled as &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; (getting a henna tattoo, learning Mongolian throat singing as a white guy) is nothing more than what our species has been doing since forever. Every nation/ tribe has been trading clothing styles, words, tattoo designs, customs/ holidays, foods etc since the very first caveman thought the other guy&#39;s spear looked cool.</p>\n\n<p>Just as an example, &quot;modern&quot; English has tons of words &quot;borrowed&quot; from French, German, Latin etc. But all those guys were white so no one cares. But what about basically the entire nation of Mexico? It&#39;s a hybrid of old Aztec, Olmec etc cultures and Spanish. And they have customs/ holidays, or foods that don&#39;t exist in Spain. So who&#39;s &quot;appropriating&quot; who? Or is it just what humanity has always been doing. I guarantee you no one from one of these actual cultures--as opposed to their SJW white knights--give half a shit about seeing their culture spread. In fact, it&#39;s probably something to be proud of.</p>\n\n<p>So that begs the question of what the &quot;end game&quot; of these SJWs are. Does every white person need to live in a beige cardboard box with no decorations and only wear a white T-shirt for their whole lives, or else they&#39;re racist? Actually, I think an archaeologist may have found beige paint pigment in ancient China, so beige is also racist now. You get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line--if these people care about real racism and oppression, maybe care about *real* racism and oppression, instead of this never-ending purity test.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
