By climate catastrophe, I&#39;m proposing a specific threshold of 3 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n<p>This is something I think about entirely too often and I have for a long time now. It might be a side effect of recently becoming a father and having a lot of younger family members. I remember writing papers on &quot;Climate Change&quot; in school nearly a decade ago. Even then, I wondered why it wasn&#39;t the main and overriding concern of the political debates and broadcasting media. Even now, I wonder why there is little concern (relatively) for clean energy, nuclear development, and electrical transport. The problems and solutions are many, nuanced and complex. There are lots of promising albeit non-fleshed out technologies i.e &quot;green&quot; concrete, biofuels, mini nuclear reactors, etc. However, my main arguments for why there is no slowing down our creep towards this threshold (and all the accompanying disasters that would accompany it) is population growth, a quickly bourgeoning middle class in high density countries playing &quot;catch up&quot; with fossil fuel technologies, combined with our unrelenting appetite of cheap oil. Consider this also, the appetite for cheap consumer goods, a global supply chain, and a government and elite class that is mostly powerless, if not outright hostile, to the changes needed to our global economic framework as it relates to sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>The science has been settled for a while now to a resounding &quot;Code Red&quot; by scientists, meteorologists, geologists, pretty much any scientist that studies Earth and it&#39;s systems can see the harm of carrying out a planet-wide experiment with our atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I was reading this article. <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2021/sep/climate-change-risks-to-australian-banks.html\">https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2021/sep/climate-change-risks-to-australian-banks.html</a> and I recently finished Bill Gate&#39;s book &quot;How to Avoid A Climate Catastrophe&quot; (excellent summary of the problems, and technology needed to fix said problems), and it pushed me to create this post to try to clear up some of my despair. I want my mind to be changed. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of micro-groups that will ultimately adapt and survive in a more volatile and severe environment. The brunt of this damage will be felt by the poorly positioned of the developing economies, which is the cruelest irony as their per capita carbon emission is tiny in comparison to anyone reading this.</p>\n\n<p>There is simply too much momentum in our old systems of operation. Our global supply chain depends on cheap fuel, our plastics and manufacturing depend on the same. Most of the rich and powerful people and groups don&#39;t give a fuck, and there is no way to get groups to work together to accept the draconian measures needed to keep warming below 2 degrees. It&#39;s business as usual for the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: it&#39;s 3 AM where I am now, will respond in the late AM</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
