To be clear, this isn&#39;t a pro-slurs freeze peach CMV, I&#39;m more just a little puzzled by what is easily the most common reaction to a slur being referenced.  </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a massive degree of reverence that is given to slurs. A recent situation occurred in my (very politically inclined, and part of an extended discussion on the subject) friend group. I was talking about the racist origins of the southern strategy and while quoting Lee Atwood, the inventor of the racist southern strategy, quoted the n word.\n  &quot;By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>This caused a brouhaha which I apologised for, despite being a bit puzzled. Everybody present was white. The context was in an explicit condemnation of racism, and was a quote of an individual who I was rather heatedly criticising at the time. It&#39;s such an abstract rule to enforce in this context. Nobody can actually explain why they&#39;re offended by it, but we&#39;ve become so socially conditioned against the word, just a mere academic reference to it is enough to make us flinch. This is insane.  </p>\n\n<p>Look, I understand that flippant use of slurs is bad. It&#39;s bad because it harms people through the normalisation of racism. But somewhere along the way refusal to refer to slurs has become a weird irreducible deontological principle that nobody seems to be able to explain. I&#39;m not suggesting we bring back the n word into common conversation, but surely just <em>referring</em> to the word shouldn&#39;t be offensive if there&#39;s no racism or risk of normalisation being carried along with it implicitly. Racism is disgusting and isn&#39;t just hurt feelings. It&#39;s extremely damaging and its influences are incredibly deeply seated in people&#39;s minds that an attack on racism is seen as an attack on a country itself.   </p>\n\n<p>When we ban certain speech, usually I understand it as a method of mitigating some kind of harm. Shouting fire in a crowded theatre. Inciting violence. Needless verbal abuse. Abuse on the basis of a protected class. I get it.  </p>\n\n<p>But not tolerating the <em>word itself</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not upset, I&#39;m just... confused. I just do not understand it. Not even a rhetorical lack of understanding, I&#39;m genuinely puzzled why people think this way. Maybe there&#39;s a good reason that&#39;s blindingly obvious that I am missing. Please, change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
