And the US DOES have their problems, mainly police brutality and health expenses. But still, my point is that, while they do have those problems, they still live in \"easy mode\" compared to other countries and refuse to see that.\n\nIt's common to hear, mainly young people, say that their country is a \"Third world with a gucchi belt\" when racial violence happens, well, let me tell you something, when that happens, hundreds of people and organizations arise to fight it and call that event as something shameful that shouldn't happen, you'll have people defending the victim. In any REAL 3rd world country, it's just a normal ass murder.\n\nIt's also common to hear people about their lack of mental health help, saying that it's hard to find correct help and that people doesn't take it seriously. Well, you still can find mental help fairly easy, to my understanding there are free options with charity organizations, but in 3rd world countries, guess what, not only it's extremely hard to find a therapist, it's a \"richs only\" luxury and the free health stablishments there are not therapists.\n\nPeople say that the US is repressive when someone complains or refutes their viewpoint during an open debate or due to the existence of places online with conservative and/or retrogade views, well, at least you aren't killed for defending the environment (look up \"monarch butterfly mexico\") or followed and then kidnapped by the police for being a student in political groups (again, mexico, and a bit of chile...and I think argentina too), that's worse than someone saying your view is wrong\n\nThere are other things that show that the US have it objectively easier, but these are the main ones I can remember.\n\nSo yeah, CMV",
