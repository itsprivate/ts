This change has nothing to do with science or safety and everything to do with squeezing more children back into the building.\n\nWhy is the new distance 3 feet, as apposed to 4 or 5 feet? Its simple, they needed to double the number of students you could fit into a classroom so they halved 6ft.  \n\nThe pandemic has been shining a light on a lot of the inequities and problems of poverty in our society. One such problem that the pandemic has shined a light on is the overcrowding of public schools.  The public schools were over crowded to begin with. The Covid restrictions made it impossible to fit the same number of children into any school building.  Even with hybrid models, school districts struggled to make the numbers work. Now that many districts have been pressured into fully reopening, they needed some way to increase the capacity of the schools, to double the numbers.\n\nIf you look at the CDC reccomendations, there are some inconsistencies. Why does it still reccomend 6ft for children walking through hallways, standing in lobbies, or sitting in an auditorium? Why does it still require 6ft for \"community settings outside of the classroom.\" Since when did the virus differentiate between a sitting in a classroom and sitting in an auditorium? What scientific study proved that the virus was more contigous when standing up vs sitting down. Why is anything outside the classroom 6ft but the classroom is only 3ft. Where is the science behind that? There is none because the only goal was to double the number of students in each classroom so that we can continue to ignore the overcrowding issues and so that we can reopen the schools for political gain.",
