Everyone grows up being told the same thing.\n\nColonel:\n\nBe nice to other people.\n\nRose:\n\nBut beat out the competition!\n\nColonel:\n\n\"You're special.\" \"Believe in yourself and you will succeed.\"\n\nRose:\n\nBut it's obvious from the start that only a few can succeed...\n\nColonel:\n\nYou exercise your right to \"freedom\" and this is the result. All rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt.
