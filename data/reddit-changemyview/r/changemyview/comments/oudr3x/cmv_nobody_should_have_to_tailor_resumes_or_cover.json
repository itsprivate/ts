Job applicants are not. It takes a long time to tailor resumes and cover letters to however many dozens of listings for however many companies to which you apply, whereas it&#39;s literally the job of somebody in a position to hire to know what a given opening requires and who will be a good fit for their organization.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Japan, there&#39;s a standard resume format that everyone uses in which you list all of your academic and professional experience - and there is far less emphasis on the cover letter. It seems to work fine,  so how can it be the case that the &quot;tailoring&quot; expectation is anything other than an attempt to shift paid workload onto people who probably won&#39;t even get a response about the job?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
