Yet because the US sits on the World Helium Reserve the and made a trade agreement decades ago, the price of helium is kept artificially low so consumers can freely use helium for leisure activities. \nIf the price of Helium really reflected supply and demand, estimates show that you would currently pay upwards of $75 for a single balloon at Disney World.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
