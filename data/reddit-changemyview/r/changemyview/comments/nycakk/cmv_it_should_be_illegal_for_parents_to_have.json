We don't pluck people's fingernails so they don't get dirt under them or remove their scalps so they don't get lice and smell bad. If you teach your kid to  wash his penis and wear a condom when he's old enough, there is no reason to chop off his foreskin for the sake of \"hygiene\". \n\n- If you argue that it's within your religious freedom to practice circumcision, I'd agree to the extent that you should be allowed to do it to yourself, BUT NOT TO YOUR CHILD. As a matter of fact, having your kid participate in any religious ritual should be illegal, but that's a topic for a different CMV. Imagine this, one day you travel abroad and become gravely ill, to the point of being in a coma. When you wake up, a group of people tell you: Hey, we thought you weren't gonna make it so we shaved your head and gave you some ritualistic tattoos because that's what we do in our religion. Wouldn't that make you feel violated?\n\n- Lastly, if we as a society agree that people should be in control of their own bodies we cannot justify the genital mutilation of people who do not consent to it. There's a reason why all western countries have banned Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), it's a horrible practice that deprives women of sexual pleasure for no good reason. It's the same thing with male circumcision, the nerve endings on the foreskin contribute to sexual pleasure and removing the foresking because God or because hygiene is not a good reason at all. \n\nMy view is that the only reason why circumcision is still legal is because if any one politician actively campaigned against it, his political party would lose a bunch of religious peoples' votes, that's it. It's legal because no political party wants to pay the price to make things right.",
