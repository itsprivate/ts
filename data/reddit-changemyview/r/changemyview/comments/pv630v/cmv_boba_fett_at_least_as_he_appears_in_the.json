I&#39;ve seen every show, played every game, regularly rewatch every movie, and have even read a couple of the books.</p>\n\n<p>With that being the case, I feel that I can definitively say that Boba Fett is the most overrated character in the entire canon. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t dislike him by any means, but he isn&#39;t nearly as cool as people make him out to be. Here are some of the most common arguments I hear:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>He&#39;s one of the greatest bounty hunters in the galaxy!</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yeah, so great that in the two movies in which he appears (in the OT) he doesn&#39;t kill a single person, barely fires his blaster at all, and gets eaten by a sarlaac when his jetpack stops working. The only thing he does of any note at all in the original trilogy is tattle to Vader that the Falcon is headed to Bespin. *insert cheems image here*</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>He&#39;s such an interesting character!</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>His dad died in front of him. Wowee. Not like we&#39;ve ever seen a more interesting character lose their parent figures before. *cough*Anakin, Luke, Rey, etc*cough*</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>But he was so badass in The Mandalorian!</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, he was, I agree! I think The Mandalorian was the first time that Boba could ever conceivably have been called badass. But people have been calling him a badass and iconic since the 80s, which I don&#39;t think is vindicated by a show in 2020 retroactively making him a cool guy.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>[insert piece of no-longer-canon Legends media that develops his character]</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Might be a controversial take, but Legends was such a far-reaching and frankly jumbled mess of plotlines that it may as well have been an expanded universe of fanfiction, and I think Disney simplifying the canon in the way it did was helpful for making the universe feel more cohesive. So the only argument I&#39;ll accept on this point is pointing to something in the current canon, but even still, again, that media can only be newer than 2012.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll consider my mind changed if you can point to a canon reason that Boba Fett has been so beloved for more than four decades. Because as it stands now, in the original trilogy Boba was about as badass as Salacious Crumb.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
