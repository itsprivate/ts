However, I choose to not be vocal about it as I&#39;m just not that interested in the topic as a whole. I&#39;m also a very passive person, and it&#39;s just in my best interest to be passive in pretty much everything surrounding my life.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve noticed that people often take the term &quot;I&#39;m not that interested in politics&quot; personally. I&#39;m not exactly sure why, and I&#39;ve never really gotten a clear answer that changes my opinion on this. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like the toxic atmosphere surrounding politics, especially within my age group (18-26). Growing up, I&#39;ve witnessed politics turn conversations ugly, I&#39;ve seen it make people go at each other&#39;s throats. I&#39;ve only ever really seen it in a negative light. I&#39;m just not interested in being associated with that.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d consider myself pretty well versed in a lot of political topics, but I also think of myself as pretty ignorant on a lot of topics compared to most other people. That is one of the reasons why I don&#39;t want to register to vote. I feel as if I&#39;m just not qualified enough to make an educated vote, and l haven&#39;t really had much interest in changing that.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that politics effect others that are less fortunate than me. But I can&#39;t see how I can do anything about it as one person. I can&#39;t understand how I can do anything to change it, as one in millions of American citizens. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of people tell me to &quot;vote for the lesser of two evils&quot; but I don&#39;t understand that logic. Why would I want to contribute to one of two evils, regardless if one is lesser? How do I know that that politician will actually follow through with their word?</p>\n\n<p>I notice every time an election happens, the voted in candidate almost never adheres to their promises. I don&#39;t agree with our government in a lot of ways, and I think it&#39;s extremely corrupt. I don&#39;t want to contribute to that. </p>\n\n<p>I have my own problems as a person and I believe if I were more versed in politics, it would make me bitter. I&#39;d rather focus on my wellbeing and those around me that I care for. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m open to someone changing my mind and giving me well thought out arguments. I&#39;m open to changing my view on politics and I&#39;m interested in learning more. I consider myself pretty open minded and I&#39;m interested in hearing other point of views in a controlled conversation about it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
