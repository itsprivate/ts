Men own guns at a dramatically higher rate than women.  Women are way more likely to have a diagnosed mental disorder.  Why?  Because they seek treatment more than men.We already have a HUGE issue with men avoiding therapy or medical help with mental issues.  The type of men who are armed to the teeth and ready to shoot up a public place are the exact same types that see therapy as something for \"Weak minded people\" and/or don't trust medical authorities.\n\nThe way I see it all mental health screenings for gun ownership would do is dramatically increase the number of men who absolutely refuse to seek any treatment. If a diagnoses means no guns, toxic men will choose keeping their gun rights over treatment 100% of the time.\n\nEssentially, banning guns from people who have diagnosed mental illness will make the mental illness crisis worse and the issue of men avoiding treatment dramatically worse without actually working towards it's intended purpose of making the world a less violent place or getting guns out of the hands of mass shooters.",
