  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>During his 2004 run as champion on <em>Jeopardy!</em>, Ken Jennings <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KoPFkjF-Bdo\">infamously responded</a> &quot;What&#39;s a hoe?&quot; to the following clue in the category &quot;Tool Time&quot;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral pleasure seeker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alex Trebek judged the response as incorrect and chastised Ken for it to boot (&quot;Whoa! They teach you that in school in Utah, huh?&quot;). Ken&#39;s opponent Al subsequently rang in with the &quot;intended&quot; response of &quot;rake,&quot; which was judged correct. It&#39;s a well-regarded funny moment in the show&#39;s history, but in my opinion, by the rules of <em>Jeopardy!</em>, there was nothing incorrect about Ken&#39;s response, and he should have been awarded that $200.</p>\n\n<p>While the clue writers typically have a specific answer (or question, if you want to get technical) in mind, the show judges each player&#39;s response based on its appropriateness to the clue, and alternatives are regularly accepted. One such example occurred relatively recently -- a clue&#39;s intended solution was &quot;tavern and cavern,&quot; but the show accepted her alternative of &quot;cafe and cave.&quot; By these standards, which to my knowledge have remained consistent since the current incarnation of the program debuted in 1984, Ken was correct: the term &quot;hoe&quot; can refer to both a &quot;long-handled gardening tool&quot; and an &quot;immoral pleasure seeker.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Possible ways to CMV include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrating that <em>Jeopardy!</em> had different rules or conventions at the time of the episode&#39;s 2004 airing, which disqualified Ken&#39;s response.</li>\n<li>Demonstrating that either &quot;long-handled gardening tool&quot; or &quot;immoral pleasure seeker&quot; are invalid descriptions of the word &quot;hoe&quot; as commonly used and accepted.</li>\n<li>Other reasoning for the show not to accept the answer, such as violating the TV-G rating, and defending why this is valid grounds to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s see what you can do, Reddit! I will defend Mr. Jennings&#39; honor as long as is feasible.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A common response that I&#39;m seeing is, &quot;the gardening tool is a &#39;hoe&#39; and the pleasure seeker is a &#39;ho.&#39;&quot; I reject this reasoning, because the spelling &quot;hoe&quot; is commonly used for <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hoe%20life\">both senses of the word</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
