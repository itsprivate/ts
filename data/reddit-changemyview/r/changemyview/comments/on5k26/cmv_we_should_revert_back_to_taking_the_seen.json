For socially anxious people (which seems to be a rising trend) this creates a pressure on both ends of the conversation to 1. Feel like a bad or socially inept person for not replying instantly. Or 2. Feel rejected if someone doesn&#39;t reply instantly.</p>\n\n<p>While I admit that this wouldn&#39;t bother someone with a healthy set of social boundaries, I fear that a big portion of people prioritise replying to the person they just got a message from over contributing to conversations with people they are actually physically sitting in a room with. I see this quite a lot already with people my age (mid 20&#39;s), and worry even younger generations will fall deeper into this hole. It already isn&#39;t an uncommon site to see couples or groups sitting together in public places looking at phones and ignoring each other, and I think this phenomenon is partially to blame.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has some counterarguments as to why the feature is more beneficial than harmful I am genuinely curious to hear and consider alternative opinions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
