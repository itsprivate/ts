I believe that it makes a huge difference for historically  disadvantaged and persecuted populations to see themselves in pop culture. I also know the benefit  that has on society broadly, so I&#39;m conflicted. I know that many actors of color want nothing more than to wear the elegant dresses of Victorian British era or as royalty in some beautiful castle. I do think, however, that it does a disservice to history and robs the weight that history should hold. Casting these actors of color in historical movies without context changes history and the lessons we should be learning. </p>\n\n<p>One might ask, but should these POC not be allowed to play anything but stereotypes; slaves, menial workers, servants? I would say, there are infinite stories to tell. There are endless worlds to portray, inexhaustible characters and settings. Having POC characters living in a world without recognizing the prejudice and inequities in context is like having women play characters in those times as if misogyny and inequality didn&#39;t exist. It actively harms the process of us as a society coming to terms with the fact that we didn&#39;t treat people well, that history happened, and that we must learn from it. One might also ask if its that big of a deal. It feels good to see a diverse ensemble on screen. They&#39;re right, however in historical contexts it makes it seem as though racism never existed.</p>\n\n<p>If we allow history to lose its context I&#39;m afraid that it will become toothless and impotent and future generations might get the impression that the kind of acceptance we have currently, was always this way. I&#39;ve gone back and forth on this for a long time. Anyway change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
