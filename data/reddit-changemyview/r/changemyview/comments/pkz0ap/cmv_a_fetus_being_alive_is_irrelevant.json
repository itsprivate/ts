Women have the agency to protect against pregnancy with a slew of birth control options (including making sure that men use protection as well), morning after options, as well as being proactive in guarding against being raped. Despite this, unwanted pregnancies will happen just as rapes will happen. No woman gleefully goes through an abortion.</p></li>\n<li><p>Abortion is a debate limited by technological advancement. There will be a day when a fetus can be removed from a woman at any age and put in an incubator until developed enough to survive outside the incubator.
