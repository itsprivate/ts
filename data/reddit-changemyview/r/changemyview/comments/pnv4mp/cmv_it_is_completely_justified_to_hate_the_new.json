Only if you are a person with very very very limited intelligence would you think that I am advocating for unsafe environments. What I am trying to say is that this &quot;new normal&quot; has continued for too long and there are just as many people who are uncomfortable with the continuation of this lifestyle and want to return to how things were in the beginning.  </p>\n\n<p>Problem is because of how America centric Reddit is I and people like me who say we hate &quot;new normal&quot; get linked with Trump, American Right, anti-vax and anti-mask crowd. People fail to understand that there are people against &quot;new normal&quot; just because they miss the old normal and it&#39;s nothing to do with America, its politics and its conspiracy theorists.  </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I know the internet makes you feel that almost 6 billion out of 7 billion population is introverted but that is not the case and even I as an introvert would not like to stop other people from enjoying things just because the current situation suits me. I want the parks to open, the crowd to cheer when the players hit a six or score a goal and not in the stupid screens on a stadium way but the actual people in a stadium way. And there is nothing wrong in that. You assuming wrong things about me is the problem here. Not me. Also fuck LinkedIn.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
