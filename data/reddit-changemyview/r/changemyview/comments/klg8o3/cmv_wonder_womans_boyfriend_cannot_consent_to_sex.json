When a strange man later confronts her claiming to be her boyfriend she realizes her wish came true, but not quite how she expected. What happened is that her boyfriend’s consciousness was transported through time and took over this man’s body. It is revealed that this man had an entire life, apartment, job, etc. so he definitely existed before the wish, thus Chris Pine essentially mind controls this poor, unnamed, man (unbelievably credited as “Handsome Man,” go ahead, check IMDB) who has no say in the experience. \n\nThe filmmakers make no attempt to address this ethical/moral/philosophical concern, and even go so far as to replace the actor who plays “Handsome Man” (Kristoffer Polaha) with Chris Pine and have Wonder Woman comment that she “doesn’t see \\[Handsome Man\\]” but rather Chris Pine. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine share a sex scene but, in the universe of WW84, it is Diana Price and some hapless “Handsome Man” being used as a fleshy puppet by Steve the pilot. \n\nSummed up, my view is this: the sex that Diana Price and the “Handsome Man” have is nonconsensual. In my view, it is no different than drugging someone with a consciousness altering substance (or, perhaps, using some hypothetical body switching technology) for the purpose of having sex with them. Sure, she may not have set out with the explicit intent of having sex with “Handsome Man” and plotted a way for her boyfriend to take over his consciousness to do the deed, but she still made the decision after the fact to have sex with someone who could not reasonably consent to it. At the end of the movie, she bumps into the \"Handsome Man\" and doesn't recognize her at all (or remember the wacky adventures his body was just on saving the world), except that he is wearing an outfit that she'd picked out for him (so, who even knows what that means). \n\nI can’t get over the fact that if the genders were switched that people would be in uproar.\n\nI really would like my view to be changed, it’s been driving me crazy since I saw the movie on Christmas. I’ve woken up my girlfriend to talk it through, I’ve mentioned it at dinner with her family, I’ve brought it up multiple times when we’re just sitting around. I can’t get it out of my head that Wonder Woman raped a man and no one is talking about it. \n\nIn writing this post I found a Forbes articles but why hasn’t this topic gained traction? Am I crazy?
