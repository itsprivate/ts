Maybe the authors believe that most readers are able to distinguish between correlation and causation, but that is surely a dangerous assumption. In Hong Kong, for example, we're already seeing people not showing up to their vaccine appointments because of these fears; in my opinion the media are partly responsible for this. CMV!",
