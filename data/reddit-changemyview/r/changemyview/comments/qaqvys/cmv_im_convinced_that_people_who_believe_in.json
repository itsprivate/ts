Also, not every person has some deep, discerning, logical analysis of life.

I think its one giant adult &#39;play-along&#39; game because its fun, but no one actually believes it if it came down to it.</p>\n\n<p>No evidence for ghosts exist, and by evidence, i don&#39;t mean human senses. Human senses can be fooled by your brain so ridiculously easy. Dreams should be enough for a logical person to understand that what they see, hear or feel can just be the brain literally fabricating information.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of years and all the knowledge we have about ghosts are blurry photos and video, cold-reading psychics and A LOT of second-hand accounts.</p>\n\n<p>With all of this, i can&#39;t accept that someone could actually believe ghosts are real. With what we know about the brain and its relation to consciousness (That consciousness is linked to a physical object, the brain) its near enough confirmed that they don&#39;t exist.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
