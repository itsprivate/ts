It's sad when old people die but it's not nearly as sad as when a healthy young person in their late teens/early twenties or even younger dies, who had their entire lives ahead of them with so many unlived memories and things they want to do or accomplish with their life. Young people who die young never get to experience living a whole nother 40 years with their life partner, or having children or traveling to their favorite places, etc.. old people have already had their chances to do that in their lives, so it's not necessarily as tragic or as sad as when old people die when they would have been near death anyway. Compare that to a young college graduate who just died and had his whole life ahead of him. For that reason I don't think you can convince me that it's more tragic when old people die.",
