But it&#39;s not possible to stop people from doing it and hence my view.</p>\n\n<p>I feel this way due to how much control a person has over certain aspects of their body. A person has very minimal control over their height as compared to their weight. Both short and fat people can work on their height and weight respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is, if you try to increase your height, there is a certain point at which you won&#39;t be able increase it further especially if you&#39;re past your 20s. But if you try to reduce your weight, you can get yourself pretty thin at a wider aray of ages. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy to reduce your weight, absolutely not. There can also be certain disorders/hormones/genes that can affect the loss of weight, but I&#39;m talking in general. </p>\n\n<p>So coming to my initial point, since increasing one&#39;s height ranges from difficult to impossible, and decreasing one&#39;s weight in most cases is just difficult, short people shouldn&#39;t be shamed as much as fat people. I especially hate that people who refer to others as fat are seen as very rude and disrespectful, but women who publicly state that they won&#39;t date a guy shorter than X feet and laugh at guys who are short don&#39;t get as much backlash.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
