  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve seen people mention they are single parents, but then I find out they have 50/50 custody with their ex spouse/partner. It’s just seems strange to me, as someone who knows literal parents that are “single” in the sense they have %100 responsibilities due to the death or complete neglect of their partner. </p>\n\n<p>In particular, I have a friend who is getting a divorce and her and her ex are sharing 50/50 custody and financial responsibility for everything, but she loves to lambast that she’s a single mom now. I just can’t jump on board but am willing to change my mind!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Oxford dictionary defines single parents as “A person brining up a child or children without a partner” but a partner is defined as “either of a pair of people engaged in the same activity”. Hence if you share 50/50 custody, you are engaged in the same activity (child rearing) and you cannot claim you are a single parent as you have a partner that is helping. </p>\n\n<p>People also keep bringing up that if a person is “single” then they are by default a single parent, but what if they start dating a new partner that has no responsibility to help out with children that are. Or their own, are they still single parents even though they are not single?</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: thinking of this mathematically, say we evaluate the time and resources spent over a two week period for parents. Case 1: joint parenting between partners. Case 2: 50/50 custody between 2 ex partners. Case 3: 100% custody to one partner. </p>\n\n<p>Case 1: </p>\n\n<p>week1- 100% resources/2 parents= 50 % recourses/parent </p>\n\n<p>Week2 - 100% resources/ 2 parents= 50% resources/parent </p>\n\n<p>Total over two week time period= 100% resources/ parent</p>\n\n<p>Case 2:</p>\n\n<p>Week1- 100%resources/1 parent= %100 resources/parent </p>\n\n<p>Week2- 0%resources/1 parent= %0 resources/parent </p>\n\n<p>Total= 100% resources/ parent </p>\n\n<p>Case 3</p>\n\n<p>Week1- %100 resources/ 1 parent = %100/parent</p>\n\n<p>Week2- %100 resources/ 1 parent= %100/parent </p>\n\n<p>Total= %200 resources/ parent</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
