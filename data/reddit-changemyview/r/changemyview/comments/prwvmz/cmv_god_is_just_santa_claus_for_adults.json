You ignore all the illogical &quot;magic&quot; and continue to believe because &quot;faith&quot; will get you presents (heaven) when you die. For most people, until aliens show up and say &quot;hi&quot;, you&#39;ll just continue to believe because people tell you to.  </p>\n\n<p>*edit*<br/>\nMy fault for not explaining this originally. I have zero issues with people believing in a religion, just the same as I don&#39;t care if children believe in Santa Claus. Religion can be good for some people and give them a reason to be better. My point is, god is just the next step in &quot;belief/faith&quot; with the same kind of core structure that Santa Claus is formed under. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
