It just seems so practical and basic.  99% of the industrialized world has implemented some form of it.</p>\n\n<p>I have lived a good portion of my life outside the US in both Germany and Japan (countries with Universal health care) and have found it vastly superior to the system present in the US.  I struggle to any clear reason why we shouldn&#39;t introduce similar comprehensive healthcare systems in the US., especially in the wake of the pandemic.  I understand that there are entrenched business and political interests at work in the US, as well as overall cultural resistance to the idea, but that, to me, is not a good enough reason why we shouldn&#39;t or can&#39;t create our own American Universal healthcare system.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Universal Health care has very few downsides, aside from putting insurance companies out of business.  Are we concerned that pharmaceutical companies will be less willing to invest in R&amp;D if it isn&#39;t as profitable?  I am not convinced.  In Japan, there is a robust pharmaceutical industry (granted, Japan&#39;s healthcare system is something of a hybrid model), and they are more than capable of creating revolutionary new drugs.</p>\n\n<p>Are we worried about the cultural resistance to it?  Socialism/Communism, etc?  I imagine socialized healthcare will become a much easier sell over the coming years to the American public.  COVID-19 has proved the absolute necessity for a socialized healthcare system.  Imagine the clusterf***** dumpster fire the vaccination rollout would have been if they would have distributed it the way regular insurance is distributed.  I think we&#39;d be looking at a 15% at best vaccination rate right now if it wasn&#39;t free.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly are the reasons we shouldn&#39;t plow full speed ahead on this?  I really want to hear a good counter-argument because I am always interested in hearing the other side.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
