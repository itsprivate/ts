Now I can afford one but I am married with two kids and I cannot help but think that it is an unnecessary risk that will make me much more likely to leave my children fatherless.  If I didn&#39;t have a wife and kids I would definitely have one at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the source, I have seen estimates that you are 27 to 35 times more likely to die per mile traveled on a motorcycle than in a car.  To me this seems unacceptably risky. </p>\n\n<p>I do realize that this is probably a self fulfilling issue to some degree. Motorcycles are seen as risky, therefore people who take more risks ride them, therefore more risks are taken on motorcycles.</p>\n\n<p>I do believe that as a risk adverse person with a lot to live for I could probably be safer than the average would suggest, but how much?</p>\n\n<p>I could be swayed by statistics showing, for example, how much less likely you are to die if you wear all the gear all the time, or showing that the vast majority of fatalities are during specific road conditions that could be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately an anecdote that you have rode for 40 years and never had an accident will not change my view, though I would be happy to hear what habits you think have lead to your excellent record.</p>\n\n<p>I would be happy to hear from other parents about how they justify the risk.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
