No matter how clean your walls are, it will always be cleaner to not touch them, thereby showing down the transfer of germs.

If the toilet paper is away from the wall, you can just grab on to it and pull. But if it’s sticking to the wall, you have to try to lift it from the wall (which is frustrating and makes horrible sounds), and then pull. And also since the toilet paper is rubbing along the wall, it can rip unexpectedly.\n\nOverall I just honestly don’t understand why people do this.\n\nCMV",
