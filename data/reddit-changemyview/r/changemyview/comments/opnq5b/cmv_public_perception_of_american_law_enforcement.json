  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think this is an unspoken sentiment shared by most people who are inherently critical or distrustful of the American police. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever I hear a news story about a police officer screaming at a four year old, or knocking over an old man on camera, there&#39;s always initial outrage followed by &quot;he&#39;s on desk duty pending an internal investigation&quot; or &quot;he&#39;s been suspended with pay pending internal investigation&quot; and then the next day a hundred people protest and its done. Quietly, the police officer more or less just goes back to what he was doing after what I presume amounts to nothing significantly more than a stern warning. There&#39;s no perceived justice to the onlookers. </p>\n\n<p>In order to do their jobs, cops have some legal leeway. They have police unions, legal channels are almost certainly going to treat them differently, and they have Qualified Immunity. It&#39;s to prevent them from being so bound by the law that they are unable to protect civilians.</p>\n\n<p>And this, I believe, is why (some) people dislike cops. They (the individuals) feel that the cops are invincible and because of that, they feel that they are basically at the mercy of the police officer&#39;s will. They think that the cops could profile them, decide on a whim to pat them down, or harass them. If they are wrongfully arrested, they have to comply or the police will subdue them violently (or in some cases kill them). In this situation the police have all of the power and the civilians have no agency, no sense of security, no confidence and feel completely and truly helpless. They feel that the most they can do is file a report that will get lost, deliberately or otherwise, in a mountain of paperwork and the cop get off scot-free.</p>\n\n<p>And then they look at the news. They see police officers pepper spraying children and nothing significant coming of it. They see an officer shoving a 78-year-old man facefirst onto concrete and the entire police union subsequently resigning in protest when accountability comes. They see a blatant attempted lynching on tape with the police coming by, making no arrests, and leaving. They see a cop giving incoherent orders, and executing a begging man on his knees, and that same cop successfully suing for a pension. They see a woman shot in her sleep by incompetent policemen, the women posthumously smeared as a drug dealer, the AG lying during trial and one of the officers having an interview playing the victim on national TV. They see political pundits constantly misconstrue basic arguments and simply state &quot;just don&#39;t do crime bro&quot;.\nThey see police paperwork and reports related to these incidents which are absolute lies and begin to wonder if they are checked by anything more than the Honor system.</p>\n\n<p>And each incident reinforces their view, logical or not, that police are <em>invincible</em>. That they cannot be harmed by the law because they <em>are</em> the law. They do good, but they can do bad, and when they do bad, they can do it with impunity and confidence knowing that they will have an advantage when charges come. The only way for there to be <em>basic</em> accountability is for there to have to burn cities down in anger and an entire summer of nationwide anger and racial tension.</p>\n\n<p>Police culture is notoriously tribal. It&#39;s a &quot;us vs. the world&quot; type mindset that&#39;s been hardened by increasing criticism of the police. Police, I assume, feel that civilians can&#39;t comprehend what the officers do on a daily basis and that slogans such as &quot;ACAB&quot; are emblematic of an ungrateful, uninformed populace spurred by outrage culture. I think this is what results in such a polarizing view of our police and both related movements - BLM and Blue Lives Matter - showing absolute disgust and bewilderment with each other. </p>\n\n<p>Just for the record, I&#39;m not a cop. I&#39;ve never been in law enforcement and likely will not enter law enforcement. I have no grasp of what it takes to be a police officer, the danger involved, the stress and toll it takes, and the commitment it requires. Truly, I mean nothing against police officers.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not here to argue about whether increased accountability would be harmful or not, because it&#39;s completely irrelevant to the argument in my opinion. I&#39;m here to argue that people would sleep better at night if they felt, at the very least, that there would be more accountability.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
