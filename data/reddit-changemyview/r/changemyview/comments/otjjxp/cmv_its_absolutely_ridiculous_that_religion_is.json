We didn’t know where the sun came from and what the stars were so we came up with the most convenient answer: God. God created the sun and stars, along with humans. This answered all of our questions, but now we have science and technology that can answer these questions and when it comes to answering questions, religion should be our very, very last resort. I still believe that religion can be used as a moral backbone for people or as a meaning to life but it should not challenge a concrete theory such as the Big Bang. Scientific theories should be challenged with other theories. I find it ridiculous that there are still christians trying to prove of their gods existence. </p>\n\n<p>(When I say religion, I mean ‘man made’ organized religions such as Christianity or Catholicity.)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Sorry for my ignorance if I am misinterpreting some of your views. I’m currently off middle school so I have been searching for somewhere to drain these thoughts haha</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
