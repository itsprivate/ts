And there are other words which carry similar implications- words like &quot;alleges&quot; also suggest to me a degree of scepticism about just what the person is alleging, whilst words like &quot;reveals&quot; suggest that what the person is discussing is a matter of certain fact which they have now disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Says/said&quot; in my view is the best word to use for a news report, because it carries the least baggage and is the least likely to unduly influence the view of the reader/viewer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
