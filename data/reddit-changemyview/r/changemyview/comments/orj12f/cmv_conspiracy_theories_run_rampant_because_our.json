Believing known liars is dumber than believing conspiracy nonsense, imo. When the main sources that inform the public are known to be corrupt then people will seek information elsewhere. The constant lies from authority are more to blame for the rise of conspiracies than the people just being dumb and believing whatever nonsense they find online.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
