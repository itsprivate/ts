Now if this was 20+ years ago I&#39;d totally agree. Nowadays though, with there being a pride month and a considerable amount of the population being accepting of gays I feel like pushing this narrative isnt going in the right direction. If a male celebrity came out and said he has sex with women we all wouldnt care and say that&#39;s not news, in my opinion that&#39;s how we should treat people coming out as gay. If the whole point of putting it in the news is the get more people to be accepting of it then it&#39;s not gonna work. If someone doesn&#39;t like people for being gay, putting it in their face that someone is gay isn&#39;t gonna change how they see gay people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
