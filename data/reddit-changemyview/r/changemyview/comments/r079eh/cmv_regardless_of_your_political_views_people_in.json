You’re sending the message to company and the market that what they are doing is ultimately okay in your eyes.</p>\n\n<p>This is based on the assumption that you have the ability to spend your money somewhere else, which I think is true much more often than not. After all, most things aren’t strictly necessary to buy.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As I’ve already awarded deltas for these points, I need to clarify that I’m talking about picking the least objectionable options you’re aware of when you shop.. not turning yourself into a saint. If our culture was more intentional with the way it spends its money, the world would be a better place.. would it not?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
