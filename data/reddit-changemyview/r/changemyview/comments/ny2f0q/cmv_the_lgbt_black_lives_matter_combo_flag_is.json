It's not like these two fights are interchangeable, the issues facing LGBT people and people of colour are pretty different and while most people who support one group normally support the other that's not a good enough reason to make the core icon of LGBT community now be linked to people of colour complicating an already massive wheel house of different groups.\n\nI support having the trans triangle because while of course the LGB and the trans community have a lot in common trans issues are also often separate from LGB issues. \n\nPride should be about gay issues and seeking LGBT rights it shouldn't be diluted by what ever social issue the culture cares about that day. I would think it's entirely inappropriate for LGBT people to go to black lives matter and say yeah I know you guys are all about people of colour issues but you need to also start talking about LGBT issues.

If a gay person could live their entire lives not knowing anything about the experience of people of colour why is it being included in their flag. Yeah I know that people of colour have not been given full credit in the LGBT movement and some key figures have been people of colour but having some extra colours doesn't change that. \n\nNot to even mention that adding that brown and black strip does nothing to actually help people of colour it merely dilutes the LGBT message. \n\n I want to like the flag but it's ugly and just screams pandering to me.
