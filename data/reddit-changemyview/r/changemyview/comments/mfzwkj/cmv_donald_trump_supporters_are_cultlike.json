They have pictures of him hung on their wall, they have mugs with his name, hats, t shirts, driving with a Trump flag just because, boating with a Trump flag, everything is about Trump. I often see videos of people crying because he lost the election, etc.\n\nYou can of course support your political candidate, no questions there, but that looks more fan-like behavior at this point. It doesn’t seem that they are supporting or even representing the republican party, they seem to just be blindly obsessed with him as a person.\n\nBut what is more concerning is the complete absence of thought process. They sponge-like just inject everything he says and retranslate everything. Sometimes, what they say doesn’t even make sense. For instance, I once heard two Republicans talk about transgenderism in our society and that is what I heard \n\n“Yeah, man. It’s all just communist-China propaganda aimed to destroy our society.” \n\nJust absolutely complete nonsense, it sounds like someone took Trump’s speech, mixed it all up and came out with this. What does China has to do with transgenders in the US? China is probably one of the furthest countries from tolerating transgenders, and what does communism has to do with it? It is just one example, but I see it on every-day basis online, which is scary. \n\nThe reason why I brought up this example, is for the purpose of showing that his supporters will listen to whatever he says, without ever doubting him. And whoever disagrees with him, in their eyes he is a liar and a “communist propagandist”. Just take a look at this election, they refuse to believe anyone who says that Joe Biden won. Quite literally every single institution in the US confirmed Joe Biden’s victory, and they still refuse to believe it.\n\nThere’s a funny anecdote I heard on r/jokes and it is so relevant and true that it hurts:\n\nTwo Trump supporters died and went to heaven, there they meet god himself. The god says “Do you have any questions for me, my sons? Ask away!”\n\nFirst trump supporter asks: “Who really won 2020 election?”\n\nGod responds: “Joe Biden won that election, all fair and square”\n\nFirst Trump supporter turns to the second one and whispers: “Wow, man. Those liberals went further than we thought”. \n\nSo there we have it: Donald Trump became a cult like persona, whose supporters believe in anything he says, refusing to believe any other institution. If that’s not a cult for you, then I don’t know what is.",
