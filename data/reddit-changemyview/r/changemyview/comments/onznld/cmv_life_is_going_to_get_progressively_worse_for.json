Cost of living and the average wage are growing at vastly different rates and that&#39;s not going to change any time soon. \nOutsourcing of jobs to cheaper countries, combined with automation is going to cause massive unemployment. Competition for even the most menial of jobs will be fierce and have even more ludicrous requirements than it does now. </p>\n\n<p>There is next to no chance, for any millenial living in a major city, to afford a home. Forcing them to chose between accepting that a huge chunk of their income will just go up in smoke each month in hugely inflated rents, or they can relocate to somewhere with significantly less resources. Often having to retrain late in life to find employment. </p>\n\n<p>Having children for us will always be a difficult choice. With the cost of living already at untenable levels, having an extra mouth to feed will be a huge liability and potential burden. That&#39;s not even factoring in bringing a new life into a world with the above mentioned issues.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying there are no millenials who can&#39;t afford homes or children. It is of course possible to save up and purchase a tiny condo and get on the property ladder etc. I&#39;m speaking broadly about the average person and quality of life, particularly compared to the vision most of us had of being an adult.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
