You have some kind of of killer stalking down and killing a group of people (often teenagers), one-by-one.  Though most people wouldn&#39;t call it the first slasher, one of the most seminal movies is John Carpenter&#39;s 1978 Halloween, whose antagonist is Michael Myers; a mute man in a white mask who goes around the suburbs killing teenagers with a knife because childhood trauma.</p>\n\n<p>And then you have the Friday the 13th series, whose main antagonist is Jason Voorhees; a mute man in a different kind of white mask, who goes around a summer camp killing teenagers with a different kind of knife because of childhood trauma*.  They&#39;re fun movies to watch, but I just don&#39;t understand how the series has become as popular as it has, when it does so little to differentiate itself from the Halloween movies that started before it. </p>\n\n<p>If you look at other Slasher movies of the same era, they share some similarities with Halloween and eachother by virtue of being slasher movies, but they put in effort to creating a premise that is sufficiently different.  Killer that stalks your nightmares and will kill you in real life if he kills you in your sleep, ghost that will kill you if you say his name in the mirror, doll that comes to life and kills people; these are all sufficiently different premises from just a guy in a mask killing people, and add interesting ways for the slasher subgenre to move forwards.   Jason Voorhees just doesn&#39;t though.</p>\n\n<p>Change My View</p>\n\n<p>* I know, I know.  He wasn&#39;t the killer in the first Ft13 movie, and he didn&#39;t have the hockey mask for all of them, but that this is still accurate for most of them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
