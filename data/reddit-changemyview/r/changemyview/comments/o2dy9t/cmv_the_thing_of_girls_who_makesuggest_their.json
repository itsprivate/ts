This seems to be rooted in some sort of insecurity and jealousy that (primarily) girls have relating to their self perception / self-esteem.  I have read countless threads and comments about how guys should respect the girls opinion and try to find a way to communicate, which I agree with but these comments and threads never mention how this issue seems to come from an area of insecurity.  There are however two sides to this coin, the guys on the other end don't seem to understand this issue and often seem like assholes about it and lack communication from what I've read.  For example, the gf would ask the bf to unfollow seomgirls because it made them feel uncomfortable, but the guy will make countless excuses about the issue like how the girl is being insecure and invaildate the girls feelings.  This is not okay and not my point, my point is to recognize the underlying issue, which I haven't heard talked about at all and try to fix it.  This issue of insecurity and jealousy and how it arises is another topic of discussion.  Can someone explain to me why I'm wrong or provide another perspective.  As a guy myself, I dont really feel this insecurity and jealousy and this post isn't suppose to be a generalization of all women, but I've primarily just seen women bring up this issue.",
