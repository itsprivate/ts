I have severe asthma, vision issues, vision blacks out sometimes, major allergies, one kidney, kidney stones, seizures (sleep ones, not often), cervicalgia (neck issues), vertigo, anxiety, a TBI (traumatic brain injury)...etc. \n\nBut the worst thing is I have migraines on average of 22 times a month. To the point of throwing up and (trigger warning) often wanting to just shoot myself from the pain. It's a nightmare. And after a migraine (with or without med help) you spend a day basically sleeping because your body has been so worn out. \n\nSo when people tell me I'm either lazy or bring up \"Well I know who is a quadriplegic with cancer that works!\", it's annoys me to no end. Now obviously I am not saying other people's health/disabilities are easy to live with of course. And there are of course people who have it even worse than me. \n\nBut most people with things like cancer, missing limbs...etc. They still have a normally wired brain. So working is not an issue (again, not that they always can work). Migraines are pure agony, sometimes for the whole day. Pain beyond imagination. One woman told me she would rather have the pain of giving birth than her migraines. \n\nHer husband works from home because sometimes she can't even take care of her kids because of the migraine. You can spend your whole day in your bedroom with room darkening shades/curtains with no noise and an eye mask on and in some cases many ice packs on your head. \n\nI've tried many jobs for a long time. Anytime I go from one temperature to another and there's a big difference (like from 80f to 65f), it triggers a migraine. Cold and heat trigger my migraines in general. If there is to much noise, I get a migraine, if I get to much anxiety, it triggers a migraine, if I am around bright lights, I get a migraine...etc. \n\nAnd with other health issues like anxiety in big crowds, being the center of attention, being talked to even at times, that causes other issues. To much activity kicks in my asthma. Most lights give my vision issues where it shakes and someti9mes my vision blacks out and I see nothing. Sometimes this leads to seizures. \n\nAs it is I already have had TBI which made me loss alot of my schooling and memories. So now I have learning issues, memory issues...etc. My IQ went from 151 to 109 (not that IQ is everything of course).\n\nOne thing people often bring up is working from home. And first issue I have is often places that let you work from home have crazy qualifications like having to have years of working at home experience beforehand. Which is ironic given how can you work at home if you are required to have worked at home before? Or some require degrees. \n\nNext issue is missing your work. Even if your at home, I'm sure any boss would not be thrilled that in a week's time I only got an hour of work done because I was spending most of my days with migraines or recovering from them. Thankfully I'm happy to see many people with migraines have the same issue with people not understanding how hard it is to work.\n\nBeing trapped on Medicaid and getting government health is hell itself. People tend to say \"You leech of the system and get free money!\" You barely get enough to even pay your rent. Food stamps only give you enough money to buy unhealthy foods. If I want to by fruits and veggies and some health drinks... I'll have enough of that for MAYBE two weeks if lucky because that stuff is expensive. Instead, you buy things like soda, ramen noodles, man n cheese, garbage cereal...etc.\nWhich makes you obese, which leads to more health issues. \n\nAnd the harassment from people finding out you on any of this stuff is another hell. You get even more anxiety from the dreading question of \"What do you do for a living?\" because you know what that entails after the answer. \n\nAnd lets not forget the side effects of my 15 meds. Including tiredness, weight gain, ruining your other organs. My first seizure med I was only 165 pounds. Within 3 months it got me up to 210 pounds. My doc switched me to something else. Since then (about almost two decades ago) I am now up to 272 pounds. \n\nNow comes \"Why not exercise then?\" Well that leads to the temperature difference which triggers migraines. ANd trust me I've tried everything when working out. Even have a treadmill so so the temp stays the same inside. But my body temp changes and I get a migraine. I even tried massive fans being on, ice packs on my head or around my spine. Doesn't make a difference. \n\nThe one and ONLY saving grace and reason I have not \"ended things\" is my wonderful wife I met 8 years ago. She came from another country and is a caring, loving and hard-working woman whom I worship. She has to deal with a husband in this situation and yet work her butt off for us. She doesn't make alot, but we survive none the less. We can't have kids because we cannot afford to, but we know its just how it is despite it hurting knowing we can't have kids yet. \n\nSo now that I wrote a book basically. CMV about making comments to disabled people just because \"I know someone\" or \"I hate leeches\"....etc.",
