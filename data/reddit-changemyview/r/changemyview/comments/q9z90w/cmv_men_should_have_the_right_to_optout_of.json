  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For this discussion I would like to focus on the matter of men&#39;s rights with regard to fatherhood. This is <em>not</em> a discussion about the morality of abortion. In order to stay on topic we&#39;ll assume that abortion is morally ethical, safe and accessible for all women regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy. We will also assume that all pregnancies arose from consensual sex. </p>\n\n<p>Sex is a natural human behaviour. Most sex is recreational, without the specific goal of creating a pregnancy. </p>\n\n<p>Women have the right to to abort a pregnancy, whatever their reason, for example: \n•They do not feel emotional able to be a mother\n•They do not have the financial means to support a child\n•They do not like, nor want children\n•They wish to focus on their career</p>\n\n<p>Today, the only women who become mother&#39;s have <em>chosen</em> to do so. Despite the &quot;it takes two to tango&quot; argument, only one person, the woman, makes the decision. </p>\n\n<p>After the act of sex men have no control over any resulting pregnancy, whether to keep it <em>or</em> abort it. Despite the fact he may have all the same reasons as the woman did in the above bullet points to not wish to be a father.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual consent is not reproductive consent. I believe that the only viable way of creating equality between men and women when it comes to reproduction is to have a legal position <em>before</em> the act of sex whereby both parties can consent to the outcome of a pregnancy. </p>\n\n<p>Eg: \nThe form (which would have to be electronic to stop either party destroying evidence) would ask the woman of their intentions if they were to get pregnant (keep or abort). \nIt would ask the man if he would take on the financial responsibility of child support. </p>\n\n<p>Both parties are then able to make an informed decision about whether or not they wish to have sex. </p>\n\n<p>I know this isn&#39;t sexy! But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d suggest it being mandatory, just something a man could do if he was concerned. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s likely not a good answer, and certainly not the best. But the gender inequality of forcing men into fatherhood isn&#39;t a good outcome either (for the man or the child). </p>\n\n<p>Men should have the right to opt-out of unwanted pregnancies just as women do. CMV good people!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
