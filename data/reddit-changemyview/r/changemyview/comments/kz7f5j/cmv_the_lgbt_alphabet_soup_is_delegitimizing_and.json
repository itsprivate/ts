By those I mainly refer to people who identify as genderfluid, agender, bigender, non-binary, as well as the ace spectrum.\n\nI've tried really hard to understand what being an \"enby\" actually means, and even after browsing countless subreddits dedicated to non-binary people, I still have no idea what they actually are and why they identify as what they do. Anybody can understand very easily what being trans is, male wants to become female or vice-versa, but what on Earth are xenogenders? I'm not talking about intersex people born with ambiguous genitalia, I know those are real, but if genders are social constructs, why are we so keen about creating more and more gender constructs instead of tearing apart those that already exist?\n\nYou can be a girl who dislikes most stereotypically feminine things and likes most stereotypically masculine things without requesting to be called by a made-up pronoun or invent yourself a made-up gender. We all agree that genders are social constructs, and women have been oppressed for centuries by the gender norms they were contrived to, so why shouldn't we destroy all gender norms instead of reaffirming them like most non-binary people do? You can be a boy who likes to wear skirts and still be a boy. Being a boy only refers to a stupid pair of chromosomes, it shouldn't be your entire identity.\n\nI fear a lot of vulnerable young people may start believing they are not cis simply because they don't conform to the medieval gender norms that prevail which let's be real most people don't. Shouldn't we let them accept what they biologically are and that they can still dress or act any way they want regardless of gender norms? Why the need for tribalism and countless labels?\n\nAs for the asexual spectrum, I don't understand why people in the LGBT community consider it a spectrum at all. True asexuals don't have a sexuality, there is no spectrum about that, it's a binary, either you are asexual or somethingsexual. If you do have a sexuality but you only can experience sexual attraction with people you bond with (demisexuals), which may due to a low libido of other factors, you are not asexual.\n\nConservatives already have such a hard time getting in their thick skulls that being gay is not a choice and that trans people should be allowed to transition as they please, but all those new terminologies unfounded by science really are not making it any easier for them to accept LGBT people as valid. Hell even for me a young gay male who's pretty in touch with the LGBT community it makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\nI met this girl who identified as genderfluid years ago, we're like best friends. She plays video games with me, she does masculine things, some feminine things, but she's still a girl. And I don't get what being genderfluid even meant? Obviously she'd never call herself that to anyone she knew IRL, and since then she stopped calling herself that, which makes me think it was just a stupid label she found somewhere to make her feel special. I hate right-wingers who call us snowflakes, but I have to say there genuinely seems to be a lot of people who are not sexual minorities but want to be LGBT allies who'll use one of those nonsensical labels to belong. Being LGBT+ is the new goth. And I find that deeply offensive to the true sexual minorities who have actual rights to fight for.\n\nIf all those words and the Internet did not exist do you really think some people would still feel like they are some kind of third gender? Gay people will know they're gay even if everybody around them is straight and they have never heard about homosexuality before, likewise trans people will experience gender dysphoria regardless of trans awareness. That's what makes those legitimate, but what exactly is an agender person experiencing? I myself don't care about gender, I'm a boy, but I don't consider it part of my core identity, I would very much prefer a fully gender-neutral society without gender norms, does that mean I am agender or enby?",
