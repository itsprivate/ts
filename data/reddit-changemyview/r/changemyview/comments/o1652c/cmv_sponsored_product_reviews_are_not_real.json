My fingers have been married to a keyboard since my early teens, and as I make the climb through my late 20s, I am starting to feel the effects of constantly sitting down. Earlier this week, I came to the decision that I needed to make some changes for the sake of my health, and I started researching to find the best standing desk options. I parsed through dozens of written reviews and a equal measure of video reviews on sites like YouTube and I found one common thread among many of them. The person or persons reviewing the product did not actually purchase it.\n\nThey either had it sent after they requested a *review copy* (which is a whole other conversation), and were propositioned by the company to review their product in exchange for a free model. Some of the sites that featured these sponsored reviews were fairly popular, as were the videos, so it was obvious these so called opinion pieces were getting plenty of attention. But how genuine can an opinion on a product be, when you got the product for free? Under no circumstance should anyone be allowed to post reviews of free products, and especially when they don't even disclose the product was free outright. During my foray into the office supply side of YouTube I encountered many reviewers using semantic sleight of hand to get around just saying they ***did not purchase the item***.\n\nMy favorite examples:\n\n\"\\[Company\\] reached out to me\"\n\n\"I collaborated with \\[company\\] to\"\n\n\"Thanks to \\[Company\\] for being a part of this video\"\n\nOf course all is revealed in the description of the video where they, likely due to fear of legal or platform trouble, place a disclaimer stating they did not purchase the product. If they were honest they would start of the video by stating clearly, \"This item was sent to me for free by \\[company\\]\", but they know this would degrade the usefulness of their review, and for good reason. The main thing that brought me to my current conclusion is how these sponsored reviews poison the well of information a consumer has to shift through in order to make an informed choice. You might say: \"Just ignore them\" or \"Take it with a grain of salt\". I don't think that is enough. There is a real harm that comes from having so many reviews on sites like YouTube with millions of hits that are essentially paid testimonials.\n\nLet me provide a scenario.: I am a YouTuber with a growing channel centered around tech reviews, news, gaming, etc. I decide I want to upgrade my setup and get more desk space, so I research around and decide to by a standing desk. It cost around $500 and 30 minutes of my time in assembly. When I decide to review this desk, I will have in my mind the amount I spent, and will be making near constant comparisons between it and the value it does or does not provide. \"For $500, I really expected better stability\", or similar statements. I am not just reviewing a product. I am in real time justifying or lamenting over my purchase.\n\nAnd for completion, let's imagine what the other side my might look like: I am a popular YouTuber with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. I am routinely asked by major and minor companies to review their products in my videos, often at no cost to me. I receive *review copies* which unbeknownst to me, may be quality controlled especially carefully and maybe even tweaked to an extent that they do not represent the product a regular consumer will receive. Sometimes I am the one doing the requesting, but in either case, I pay nothing. When I review a desk, there is no careful consideration regarding whether the money I spent was worth it, because I didn't spend any. My comparisons are cold and unfeeling because the entire thing was one big transaction, and my review is being compensated.\n\nYou do not get honesty from the latter scenario. There may be some paid reviewers who try to be truthful in there reviews but the conflict of interest is far too great to ignore, and if you ask me, is criminal in a lot of ways.\n\nLastly, while it was the standing desk research that brought this issue to the forefront of my mind, most of what I discussed in this post is directly, if not perfectly applicable to other consumer products. Tech, clothing, art supplies, shoelaces, the little plastic tips you put on shoelaces, shoes, lace, you name it.\n\nEnd rant",
