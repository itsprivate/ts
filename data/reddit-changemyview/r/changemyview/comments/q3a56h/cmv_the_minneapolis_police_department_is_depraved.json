Thank God that veteran Jaleel Stallings was found not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>They (and maybe most city and real police) need to be torn down and a true “public safety” department ACCOUNTABLE to civilians (no more police policing the police crap) that protects the public and doesn’t hunt them needs to take their place. No more warrior shit, this is not Iraq or Somalia. You patrolling American cities with American civilians.</p>\n\n<p>CMV. I am not anti-cop and I am not against defunding the police. I am for some reallocation to public services and police should be trained and educated (yes a college education, associates at a minimum) and not some GED HS drop outs with ego complexes</p>\n\n<p>Edit: grammar and spelling due to audio text</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
