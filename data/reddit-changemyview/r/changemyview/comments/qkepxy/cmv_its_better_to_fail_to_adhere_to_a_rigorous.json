Most moral frameworks don&#39;t expect you to <em>succeed</em> in 100% adherence either, they just demand that you <em>acknowledge</em> the behavior as problematic and <em>attempt</em> to address it. If you adopt a system that is permissive of the behavior, you haven&#39;t actually done anything to remedy the behavior, therefore the adopted system is poor. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Argument #3 feeds into argument #2 in that adherents failing to act within their framework isn&#39;t proof that it&#39;s a poor system, it&#39;s proof that the metrics in place are actionable and require effort. If I call myself the high priest of nothingism, the fact that I have never once acted hypocritically against my belief(that nothing matters) doesn&#39;t indicate it is a better moral framework, whereas if I adopt the belief that eating any living thing is immoral and end up eating a carrot, the failure to adhere to that one policy incidentally illustrates every other aspect of the ideology I have upheld. One belief never impacted my behavior, the other belief impacted my behavior so much that one transgression became glaring and obvious. The second system is superior to the first.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
