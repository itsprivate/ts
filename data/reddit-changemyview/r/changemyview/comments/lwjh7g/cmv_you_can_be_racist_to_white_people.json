We talked about how imitating “rednecks”, “hillbillies”, “white trash” is similar to imitating Chinese people or Indian people.

Which is why in my view - you can be racist towards white people.\n\nI’m open to all perspectives, and want to see my viewpoint can be changed. I understand from grad school that people in power can always go back to their comfort of power and privilege and that allows any racist attitude to simply rub off their backs - but this is a viewpoint that I believe to be contrary to human experience. \n\nFor context - I am brown, South Asian.",
