For the record my company is fantastic and I’ve never had an issue in any way with them - but in my career I’ve experienced and observed an imbalance that rarely seems to be spoken but it’s real: if you’re not engaged, married or have a child - your personal time isn’t as valuable. </p>\n\n<p>I’m learning more and more every day how hard working parents work. Im exhausted mentally at the end of a 12 hour day and I take care of myself and live with my girlfriend and pets. I can’t imagine how difficult that must be. I appreciate my parents so much for the way they provided for me. I appreciate the people I work with for how hard they work and try not to bring their personal lives into work but it happens and that’s completely understandable. </p>\n\n<p>That being said:</p>\n\n<p>I shouldn’t have to feel guilty that my choice of lifestyle right now is to build a career and enjoy life with my partner. When someone is needing to work the closing shift tomorrow or needing to come in early to do a task - it’s not my problem that your son’s piano lesson is on Thursday. </p>\n\n<p>My preference to go eat pizza and drink beer with my girlfriend and dog is my choice. Your life choices resulted in your child. I shouldn’t have to feel bad for wanting to go live a social life because I consciously choose not to live my life that way at this moment. The people with children who look down on single professionals are insulting. </p>\n\n<p>If you work hard and pull your weight then I’m happy to help out my team. However, I think HR teams should acknowledge the difference in standards and expectations between those with and without kids or spouses. I should get paid more than you if you get any preferential treatment. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry if this was done wrong - first post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
