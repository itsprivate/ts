As a balding person, nothing would make me feel less confident than being tied to a rigorous hair care / cosmetic ritual, and feeling like I was being judged when I forgot to do it. Balding people, do whatever the hell you want with you hair, it&#39;s your hair. If you want to grow a long wispy ponytail, fucking do it queen. If you want to shave every day, fine by me. If you want to rock a toupee, rock a toupee. You should definitely come to terms with your baldness, but don&#39;t let anyone imply you&#39;re pathetic because you refuse to shave it all off. You don&#39;t have to shave to own your bald(ing)ness. Confidence comes from inside.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
