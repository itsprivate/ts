I don’t think sleeping around is bad if you don’t have a boyfriend and make your intentions clear and don’t manipulate. And I’m fine with sex work, and all for legal prostitution. BUT, despite all that I just think that 18-20 is too young, especially being a teenager. I just graduated and know people who still live with their parents and have an only fans where they produce explicit photos, and personally I think that making that type of decision requires maturity, and having a little more life experiences to do, and also that people who do that help the idea of as soon as we’re legal we can be preyed on. I’ve also seen that the term #teen trend on pornhub, which I find disgusting. Personally I think one should have lived on their own and experience life outside their parents house to choose that type of path, because making porn out of your parents house to me sounds like borderline child porn.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
