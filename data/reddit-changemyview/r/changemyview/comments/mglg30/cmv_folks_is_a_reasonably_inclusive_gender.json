But in this case, that's exactly what I think it is. \n\n\"Folks\" is an inclusive word. It means \"people.\" It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we're lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as \"folks.\" \n\nBut apparently, people are intent on spelling it \"folx,\" with the \"x\" indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn't make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. \"Folks\" didn't exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means \"people\" -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren't *people*, then they were already included and accepted in that term.\n\nI understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be *some* value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term \"latinx\" (which could be its own discussion, but I'm just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone's feelings on \"latinos/latinas,\" \"latinx\" is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  \n\nBut \"folx\" doesn't add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter \"x\" as a reference to the fact that \"x\" has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn't have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user's own ego -- to say, \"Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me.\" Signaling that you're a good person in a way that doesn't change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn't a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. \n\nThe only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind \"folx\" is the historical usage of \"volk\" in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to \"the people\" as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that's a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it's a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn't forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. \n\nPeople who spell it as \"folx\" are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue.
