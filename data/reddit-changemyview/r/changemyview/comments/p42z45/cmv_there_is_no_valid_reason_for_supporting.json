  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are countless flawed arguments used by people who support maintaining or bringing back the death penalty, but almost all of these fall apart upon closer scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Screw them, they deserve it!&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Humans are flawed and make mistakes, and there is no way to design a 100% fullproof justice system. </p>\n\n<p>Even &quot;concrete&quot; forms of evidence like DNA evidence or photographs can be falsified, misleading or otherwise flawed.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment will therefore inevitably kill innocent people, which is something that can be seen in these systems all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>Innocent people <strong>will</strong> die, and if you knowingly advocate for capital punishment in spite of this, you are essentially saying that your feelings of revenge are more important than innocent lives being taken.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Why waste taxpayer money on keeping these bastards in prison!?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Owing to the investigations/appeals needed to reduce (but not outright eliminate), killings of  innocent people, capital punishment actually ends up costing more than prison in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>This has nothing to do with the methods of execution used, so the argument, &quot;well just use x&quot; goes completely out of the window.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;The death penalty will deter other people from committing the same crimes!&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even if capital punishment could be done perfectly, it still wouldn&#39;t work as a deterrant. This is a myth.</p>\n\n<p>Heinous crimes have existed throughout the entirety of human history, yet in a majority of these time periods, you could get executed for far less severe crimes than today.</p>\n\n<p>Still, this did nothing to reduce crime, <em>because the death sentence, like all harsh punishments, does nothing to address the root causes of crime</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Harsher punishments didn&#39;t work against drugs, and they wouldn&#39;t work here, as execution does nothing to address the socioeconomic conditions that lead to crime, a person&#39;s mental health, or other factors.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Our government shouldn&#39;t tolerate &quot;x&quot; criminals!&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Governments should not have the power to execute their own citizens, due to the possibilities for mistakes and corruption mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>Some people argue against this by saying: but what about the police/army then?&quot;, but there is fundamental difference between killing a criminal in the heat of a crime, or a soldier in combat, vs a disarmed prisoner who is no longer a threat. </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Screw the legal red tape, I&#39;d kill them myself, no extra resources needed!&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Appointing state sanctioned executioners is a paradox. </p>\n\n<p>On one end, you may have a good person doing a difficult task, but even these people will be affected by taking another life. You therefore end up with damaged people as more victims of the system. </p>\n\n<p>On the other side, you may have sadists or psychopaths who actively enjoy the job. In this case, you&#39;ve just defeated the purpose of having capital punishment to begin with, as you&#39;re giving the oppprtunity to kill to somebody who enjoys it. </p>\n\n<p>Also, no, we couldn&#39;t just leave the task to any affected parties/victims, as the justice system is supposed to be fair, equitable and impersonal, not a random crapshoot of revenge and personal motives.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Certain people just don&#39;t deserve to live.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself, is it better to live in society that believes in principles of mercy, restraint and reformation, or a society that throws all of them away to get revenge on a tiny minority of criminals?</p>\n\n<p>Human rights exist for a reason, and give us a standard of behaviour to abide by. If we start adding in loopholes and exemptions for people we hate or disagree with, *then by definition, you no longer have &quot;human&quot; rights.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post. I just hear these arguments used so often, despite literally all of them being incredibly shaky once an emotional response is set aside.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
