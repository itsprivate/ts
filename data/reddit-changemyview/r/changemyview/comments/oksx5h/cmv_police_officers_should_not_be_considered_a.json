I realize that officers are not a federally protected class (Race, Color, Religion or creed, Sex, Age, etc.), so I will be referring to the state law, specifically SB 103,  VICTIM TARGETING PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS. Several other states (Georgia, Mississippi, etc.) have also drafted similar legislation. </p>\n\n<p>The term “protected class” refers to groups of people who are legally protected from being harmed or harassed by laws, practices, and policies that discriminate against them due to a shared characteristic. I believe the characteristics that fall under this should either be 1) those that are out of one&#39;s control (sexual orientation, gender, race, etc.) or 2) familial status (children, pregnant women, divorced people, etc.). In order to be logically consistent, I will include veterans as a group that should <strong>not</strong> be a protected class for the sole reason that they served (excluding those who were drafted, as that is not under their control). This does not apply if they fall under another category for which they would potentially face discrimination, such as disability.</p>\n\n<p>Career is a choice. There is truth in when people say &quot;an officer can always take off his/her badge; a person of color can&#39;t take off their skin.&quot; In a career in which you serve the public and represent the government, critique should be expected. To hinder such would be a violation of the first amendment. The First Amendment protects us against <strong>government limits</strong> on our freedom of expression. Those laws allowing such are anti-constitutional and an infringement of our rights. </p>\n\n<p>I am open to have two views changed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Police officers and/or other government careers should be a protected class.</li>\n<li>Other characteristics not including those outside of one&#39;s control/familial status should be included as protected classes.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
