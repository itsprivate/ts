I understand that purposely trying to upset someone with racism or homophobic slurs, and things like that to upset someone is uncalled for but like other things there has to be intent for something to be considered an attack on someone.

Just because I say something offensive doesn&#39;t mean I actually intent to cause harm to anyone. </p>\n\n<p>PC is just an easy way for people who think way too highly of themselves to point out everyone else&#39;s mistakes instead while hiding their own, and trying to control what other people say, control how other people express themselves. People who do this piss me off to another level. Just mind your business and leave other people alone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
