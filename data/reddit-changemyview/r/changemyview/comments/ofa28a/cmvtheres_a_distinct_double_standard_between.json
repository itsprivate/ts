Like the description in the sub says I understand my view may be flawed and I&#39;ll except that if it is. Basically the reason I feel this way stems from something from my childhood. </p>\n\n<p>My mom was adamant about letting everyone know that if her husband (my stepfather) didn&#39;t listen to her or do what she wanted, she&#39;d smack him. Now I&#39;m not saying she meant it but it&#39;s the fact that she was able to get away with saying it in the first place that bugs me. If it were my stepfather saying that to her he&#39;d get shit from everyone in the room. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen woman literally smack their boyfriends/husband&#39;s in the face out of frustration then acting like nothing happened and no one said a single word. When I hear woman say things like &quot;I keep my man on a tight leash&quot; oh, so you mean to say that you control him like he&#39;s your pet or something?</p>\n\n<p>When men cheat (and I&#39;m not condoning the cheating part) I&#39;ve seen woman literally go full blown bat-shit crazy and start swinging on him and trying to beat him up. If the roles were reversed there the man would still be called a piece of shit for trying to assault her even if she cheated. I&#39;ve also seen men who&#39;ve cheated get publicly shamed for it but why do I feel like if the roles were reversed in that situation the man would get called cruel or childish? It is doesn&#39;t make sense to me and it&#39;s really frustrating.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
