Leading to scores of angry, young and disaffected Muslims becoming radicalized to commit horrific acts of violence. \n\nThis is now happening within Republican circles. \n\nA refusal to acknowledge, confront and address radicalization because of an \"us vs them\" mentality and a belief that \"only a small minority are responsible\". \n\nThe instant response to this from Republicans is going to be: ***\"but what about all the far left extremists??\"***\n\n[https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-terrorist-threat-confronting-the-united-states](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-terrorist-threat-confronting-the-united-states)\n\n[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/27/in-america-far-right-terrorist-plots-have-outnumbered-far-left-ones-in-2020](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/27/in-america-far-right-terrorist-plots-have-outnumbered-far-left-ones-in-2020)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/)\n\nIntelligence agencies all over the western world have definitively asserted on numerous occasions that the threat from far-right extremists is incomparably greater than the threat posed by far-left extremists. \n\nYou can cry about Antifa all you want the reality is the threat is significantly less severe, right-wing extremism today has even surpassed Islamic extremism in scale and threat.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing\\_terrorism#United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_terrorism#United_States)\n\n>As of 2020, right-wing terrorism accounted for the majority of terrorist attacks and plots in the United States.[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_terrorism#cite_note-Wilson_Guardian-85) As of April 2021, the [New America Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_America_Foundation) placed the number killed in terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 as follows: 114 killed in far-right attacks, 107 killed in jihadist attacks, 17 killed in [\"ideological misogyny/incel\" attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogynist_terrorism), 12 killed in [black separatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_separatism)/[nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_nationalism)/[supremacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_supremacy) attacks, **and 1 killed in a** [**far-left**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left) **attack.** \n\nIt's indisputable fact. Left wing extremism is not posing a significant threat to the US public, Right wing extremism is. \n\nAngry, young, disaffected Republicans have found themselves emboldened and are being increasingly radicalized to commit acts of terrorism and the so called \"decent majority\" are doing nothing to confront it. \n\nJust like Islamic communities, you have a responsibility to not only distance yourselves from these extremists, but also to root them out of your communities.\n\nSitting in silence and pointing the finger at the other side of the aisle is disingenuous and dangerous. You're responsible for the growing threat posed by others within your movement.\n\nSo CMV - why isn't radicalization within Republican communities a problem?",
