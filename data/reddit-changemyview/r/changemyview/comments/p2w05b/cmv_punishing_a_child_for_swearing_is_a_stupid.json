As in it feels much better to say them knowing that you can’t say it often, like a colloquial “treat”. However, I don’t believe this is justification for explicit punishment, as swearing within itself doesn’t harm anybody, and everyone has the right to ruin the words for themselves should they feel like it. </p>\n\n<p>Essentially, if a kid stubs his toe on the school blacktop and says “FUCK” in response, punishing or telling that kid not to say that word serves no beneficial purpose. Karens who “WoUlD NeVeR wAnT mY cHiLd tO sAy SuCh ThInGs!!1!” Need to get over themselves and really think about why they think that way.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just wanted to elaborate further. I agree that we should educate kids about when it is and isn’t okay to swear GIVEN the current social standards. I just think the social standards are arbitrary and hold us back (which isn’t the most mind-blowing conclusion, I know). In a perfect world we wouldn’t have these standards. They are bad standards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
