If someone&#39;s ADULT parents beat them up as a child, and you&#39;re telling that person that they &quot;need to be the bigger person&quot; and essentially bottle up their anger and let those people get away with it, you&#39;re just adding to people&#39;s despair. </p>\n\n<p>I agree that in a lot of situations, that&#39;s a warranted mentality. But there&#39;s a lot more where blowing up and getting your anger out on someone who /literally/ deserves it is warranted. </p>\n\n<p>Example: Both of my parents were extremely abusive and I ended up in Foster Care, when they tried to contact me years later, I said some things that most humans probably SHOULDN&#39;T say to another person, intentionally made them cry, and then blocked both of them. I don&#39;t, and will never think I was the asshole for what I said, I had spent literally YEARS &quot;being the bigger person&quot; and trying to calmly explain to them what they had done and constantly being ignored and belittled and ridiculed. The only thing that finally set me on the path to closure and healing was when I finally got the chance to &quot;get back at them&quot;, and get my anger out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
