Having to push my thumb all the way to the top of the Xbox controller and push down on it to constantly sprint forward in a shooter game makes my hand completely cramp up after a while. With PS controllers, since the analog stick is towards the bottom, pushing upwards doesn’t cause as much strain. </p>\n\n<p>I also like the mention that many mention ease of access to the d-pad with the Xbox controllers. For me, the d-pad is probably the least used button on the controller (again, I typically play shooters &amp; I also rarely use the d-pad in sports games like 2K and Madden). I do understand that some single player games utilize the d-pad more, but unfortunately Sony largely has the better exclusive catalog imo. I also feel like people who use this argument basically admit that that specific spot on a controller is easier to access, making the PS controller better if you feel the analog stick is more important (which I do).</p>\n\n<p>I am open to thoughts because some of my friends that play Xbox want me to switch over because cross play only supports a select few games that we’re bored of. I’m a long-time PS player so I’m having a hard time with the controller issue especially as I feel the Xbox controller is just objectively worse. Thanks all!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
