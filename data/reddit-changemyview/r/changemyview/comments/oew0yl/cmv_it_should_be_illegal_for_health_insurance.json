In my opinion it should be illegal for an insurance provider to have access to &#39;plan discounts&#39; that the average consumer cannot have access to. An example, I have needed some blood work and imaging recently. Quest diagnostics billed nearly $800 total for 2 round of blood work. The insurance company paid approximately $80 of it, due to the plan discount. This is the case across the board. Needed an MRI, cost was $2200, the plan discount brought it down to $950. To be clear, they reduced the total amount to those values via plan discounts, I&#39;m not complaining that they didn&#39;t cover the remainder.</p>\n\n<p>The US has a major issue with their cost of Healthcare. Can someone change my view and explain to me what the benefit of allowing this is, versus the MRI just costing $950 and the blood work just costing $40 and forcing the insurance company to pay the 100% (assuming the plan states they need to cover 100%).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
