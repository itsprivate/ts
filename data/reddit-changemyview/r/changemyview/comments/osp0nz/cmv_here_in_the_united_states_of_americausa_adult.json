  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First of all, I think every choice that doesn&#39;t affect, or harm someone should be legalized. <em>Adult</em> prostitution(18 years old, and older) is generally a mutual agreement between both adults. One adult pays the other adult for intimate relations, and they both agree on it. This means one adult has the freedom to spend his/her money however he/she wants, and the other adult has the freedom to use his/her body however he/she wants. Therefore, since both choices aren&#39;t harming anything else in society, it should be legalized. One could argue this negatively affects their &quot;personal lives&quot;, but there is some grey area to that statement. One could also argue drinking alcohol, and gambling(just two examples) negatively affects people&#39;s personal lives, yet, both of them are widely legal beginning at 21 years old, so that argument is invalid. </p>\n\n<p>Second of all, we already have pornography widely legal in the USA, which is essentially prostitution with an audience. Most porn stars are solely doing porn because they can make quite a bit of money, so isn&#39;t that the same dynamic as prostitution? The only reason I think porn is legal, and not prostitution is because porn helps big business. </p>\n\n<p>Third of all, one main reason why pornography is illegal is due to it being &quot;immoral&quot;. I don&#39;t think laws should be dictated solely on immorality. Murdering someone, raping someone, and stealing from someone else are actions that are widely considered immoral, <em>but</em>, all three of those actions also grossly harm other people, and/or ends human lives. On the other hand, as I stated before, alcohol, gambling, and even tobacco use can be considered &quot;immoral&quot; to some people, yet, all of those are widely legal.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth of all, there are sexually frustrated people who don&#39;t want to  ruin their lives by risking getting caught seeing a prostitute. It may not sound like much, but it could cause someone to be terminated from their job, and being blacklisted from their careers. With legalized prostitution, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue at all.</p>\n\n<p>Other than the flawed &quot;immorality&quot; argument, the only consistent argument I see against legalized prostitution is the notion it would increase human trafficking. However, I think that&#39;s speculation more than anything, and we already have a human trafficking problem in the country anyway, so what difference does this make?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
