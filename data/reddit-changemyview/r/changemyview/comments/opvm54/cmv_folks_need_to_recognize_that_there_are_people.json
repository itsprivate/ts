  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I see it in debates about Abortion. Pro-Choicers are often eager to say that the only arguments the Pro-Life crowd can go off from is by an outdated appeal to religion when there are people in the discussion who don&#39;t subscribe to said religion. There are those who go as far as to claim that every single Republican/Conservative talking point can and only functions through appealing to religious values.</p>\n\n<p>If this was actually the case, the Republican/Conservative party would be long dead by now. I, as an agnostic, would not exist for I am personally Pro-Life. There are plenty of arguments in the abortion debate that make a solid argument for the Pro-Life side- arguments that are completely based in scientific process and philosophical thinking (I say &quot;philosophical thinking&quot; in the most milquetoast sense in that people believe that we ought to do what is morally ethical in most situations).</p>\n\n<p>Now, this is not to say that there <strong><em>aren&#39;t</em></strong> Pro-Lifers who base the core foundations of their beliefs completely and only on religion, believing that their religion is the only valid answer to any conundrum. But as much as the &quot;Radical Feminazis&quot; are said to be &quot;loud, obtuse, fringe extremists&quot; of the feminist movement and should be rightfully recognized as a minority in their own movement, so should the same go with the overtly religious folk who base their morality based on their god or gods.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s daunting how many posts I see in this sub that are so inexplicably ignorant to the actual core beliefs of conservative ideology. As a Korean American who&#39;s pursuing a degree in fine arts, I once had a brief identity crisis squaring my conservative viewpoints with the overwhelming cultural opposition and pressure (I felt) that was present from my peers. When I vented about this in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/\">r/internetparents</a>, a supposedly helpful subreddit that aims to support each other, among the sympathetic comments I received I also was handed some lashing criticisms over my stated political allegiance. One comment read, for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tough Love:<br/>\nConservatism is antithetical to art.<br/>\nBy its nature It is not about expressing yourself. It is about conforming to the imagined past or the status quo. It does not encourage self exploration except as a way to self hypnotize and subsume your self worth.<br/>\nIt does not produce anything truly artistic. At most, it produces works praising and reinforcing the status quo. Like art in the middle ages praising the divine or their rightful representative on earth(bishop/lord/king etc).<br/>\nYou will constantly deal with this your entire career. You might be better of switching majors to something that fits into your worldview.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The following sentence is my personal venting of frustration from this comment, it is in no way meant to contribute to the overall thesis of my post:) Fuck you, you piece of shit. You know nothing about me, you know nothing about &quot;conservatism&quot;, and you know nothing about artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely cannot understand how a person expects to have an open-minded discussion on anything remotely political or societal when they have such a myopic view of the world that stereotypes one side (while of course, leaving out their own) into easily tackle-able strawmen and fallacies. The only conclusion I can have for those people, <strong><em>and even if they&#39;ve supposedly happened to have only interacted with these &quot;bad arguer&quot; breed of the opposition</em></strong>, to claim that the entire demographic operates on the same principle is a deliberate attempt at sabotaging any sort of actual opportunity for discussion and ignoring the nuances and differences individuals have from each other.</p>\n\n<p>Background: I&#39;m a College-aged Korean/American who aligns with the conservative viewpoint. Born in the states but raised most of my life in Korea, I understand, accept, and even welcome the idea that everyone has their different experiences throughout life that morph them over time. I apologize if this CMV seems relatively unhinged from the other posts, it&#39;s been something that&#39;s been plaguing my mind for a while and I needed to vent it out and talk to others about it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
