All written evidence from this time period is shrouded in religious fiction, and even if it wasn't you can't invade a nation because you claim you had ancestors that lived there 3000 years ago.\n* If having a kingdom in a place a long time ago was justification for the occupation of another sovereign state we would still be in the middle ages and virtually every other peoples that has ruled Palestine over the last 3000 years (Assyrians, Iranians, Greeks, Egyptians, Italians, Syrians, Abbassids, Fatmids, Ayyubids, Mamluks, and Turks) would have a better claim than Israel.\n* The Ottoman Empire ruled Palestine for the last 530 years until their occupation, dissolution and partition at the end of WWI for being on the wrong side.\n* The territories that were formerly controlled by the ancient empire were then divided up by westerners with no concept or care of the culture or politics of the region creating the sublimation point for virtually every sectarian crisis since then in the middle east.\n* The UK creates Mandatory Palestine and manages to promise the territory to themselves (while also promising France they could have Syria), the prince of Mecca that he could have all of modern day Saudi Arabia and Palestine in exchange for leading a revolution in 1915 against the Ottoman Empire (which he totally did), and to the Zionists with the Balfour declaration. I mean what could possibly go wrong?\n* With the creation of the United Nations and being totally out of fucks to give, the UK gives them a really easy first problem to ponder and promptly fucks off like it was never involved.\n* The United Nations makes some toothless declarations that the Zionists ignore and in 1948 they go to war with the native populace displacing over 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in the process and creating the new state of Israel.\n\nHad the UK prioritized the issue and committed to solving it the last 80 years we wouldn't be in this mess. The occupation of Palestine is a direct result of the partition of the Ottoman empire and the United Kingdom's colony in Mandatory Palestine.\n\nFurthermore, the United Kingdom has power and leverage that the UN did not and still does not have, so by passing the issue to the international community to handle, they knowingly created the pretext and environment that has caused so much violence and claimed so many lives.\n\nHad the United Kingdom not taken a backseat role the last 80 years things could of been very different, and in my opinion they have an obligation to rectify the conflict they created.\n\nI am 100% open to being wrong about this, but I don't see a conceivable reason for the United Kingdom's decisive and frankly morally bankrupt handling of the situation over the last century.",
