Imperial Japan took it to the next level. Nazi rape was not to the extend of the hundreds of thousands of girls and women set up in Japanese “comfort stations.” Nazi torture was not as extensive as the death marches of Southeast Asians, the Nanjing Massacre, and Japan’s other torture methods like bamboo torture, bayoneting fetuses, decapitation contests, and mass forced burials. \n\nAnother reason Imperial Japan was worse than Nazi Germany was because Nazi Germany had a greater interest in the well-being of their people. Once it was clear the Nazis would lose, Hitler commit suicide and 3 days later the Nazis surrendered. Imperial Japan was very dedicated to their idea of never surrendering. While their resolve was impressive, it included gratuitous deaths in battles such as Okinawa. Most importantly, Imperial Japan’s refusal to unconditionally surrender a losing war was the reason why Hiroshima was bombed. Their skepticism regarding America’s ability to replicate the atomic bomb was the reason Nagasaki was bombed. In a sense, Imperial Japan was more responsible for the deaths by the atomic bombs compared to the US wanting to end the war sooner.\n\nAfter taking into account the unique evils of Imperial Japan, I believe it is in the same range of evil as Nazi Germany. It would make sense for me to say Hirohito and Sugiyama are just as bad as Hitler.",
