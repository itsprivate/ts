I&#39;m thinking about this in terms of asking someone out on a date you&#39;ve known for a while or had one or two dates with already. Also, I&#39;m really only here to debate which should come first: dinner or a movie, not the viability of the concept in general. </p>\n\n<p>Even though the phrase &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; puts dinner first, I maintain that this is simply because it sounds nice phonetically and that you should chronologically plan to go to the movie first, then dinner. </p>\n\n<p>If you go to dinner first and you&#39;re not having fun, you&#39;re bound by social convention to go to the movie anyways. If you are having a good conversation, it gets cut short because you have to be silent in a movie theatre. If you decide to skip the movie, you&#39;ve also wasted money on movie tickets. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you go to the movie first, it starts you with a talking point and makes conversation much easier. If dinner is awkward, you can rush through it and leave without social expectation to stay afterward. If you decide to skip dinner, all you do is cancel a reservation, not bite the bullet on the cost of movie tickets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
