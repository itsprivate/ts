In some cases it is eventually discovered that the husband is the one with fertility problems but the woman has been shamed her entire life. The women have to cook and clean regardless of how stressful their day jobs are. It’s the same story in the Arab world and places like Pakistan and Afghanistan where women are even killed. \n\nIn Europe and North America in contrast, women don't have any of these problems. They are free to make choices just like men and they have access to the same opportunities as men. They may not always get the same results as men but this has nothing to do with a patriarchy holding them down. Western feminists have turned to witch-hunting because there's no legitimate battle to be fought anymore. They complain about unequal representation at the CEO level ignoring the fact that most men never reach that level. They complain about wage gap in sports ignoring that most people, including women, don't have an interest in viewing female sports. They insist that all women should be believed in rape cases even when it's clear that people lie. They actively try to shut down men's rights movements and male domestic violence shelters. They fight against men getting 50 percent custody of children. They invent terms like mansplaining to make men feel guilty for expressing themselves. I live in Europe and see no differences in the rights and privileges afforded to men and women. Of course women lack access to certain things but so do men. Both genders lack some things. Why not focus on obtaining these things instead of blaming men and the patriarchy for your inability to obtain them? Would be nice to hear your opinions on this issue and possibly alter my views on this topic.",
