There’s nothing they can do about this, short of leg lengthening which is very expensive, high-risk, painful and can necessitate many many months of recovery time. Other than lifts there isn’t an option to boost their height.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, wearing foundation to give the appearance of better skin, push up bras for boobs and even heels to give height, longer legs and a bigger bum aren’t questioned or stigmatised in the same way as a guy wearing shoelifts. Some people may point to it being dishonest, but I feel as long as the guy is truthful if/when asked about height there isn’t anything more deceptive than the equivalents with women.</p>\n\n<p>I am here to have my view challenged/changed so plz don’t just call me an incel or midget.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
