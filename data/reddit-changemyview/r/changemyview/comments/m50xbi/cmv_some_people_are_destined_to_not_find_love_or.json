If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it is another’s.” \nExcerpt From - The Enchiridion - Epictetus \n\nThis author talked about doesn’t need to be god or any deity it could be math, a percentage of people won’t find love and that’s a fact, you may be a part of that statistic. \nJust to make myself clear I’m not saying the opposite sex is to blame here, guys shouldn’t blame girls for their celibacy or vice versa, we’re all just playing our parts in the drama that is life.\n\nEffort may not even matter in some cases, you’ve just been dealt a bad hand, if everyone had a great hand poker would be boring. Just cuz you won’t have a partner, doesn’t mean you’re not destined to great things.\n\nNow for the “it’s not a bad thing part”, evolution depends on the undesirable traits not being passed, if everyone reproduces there is no progress, people won’t become prettier or smarter. You may think “how is that fair for the celibate person” and I answer you with “Does the rock that sits on the base of the mountain think it’s less important than the rock on the top” , without the rocks on the bottom there is no top, without losers there aren’t winners, so is life.\n\nAnd no I’m not an incel lol 😂, too young to be one anyway, have my whole life ahead and whatever destiny has stored for me, maybe that’s celibacy who knows.\n\nEdit: Since it might not be clear what I’m trying to get challenged is “It’s not a bad thing because evolution depends on it”",
