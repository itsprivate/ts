A physicist on the usage of &quot;weight&quot;, and so on. Or a personal favorite, focusing on a pronunciation mistake as a way to dismiss the knowledge (translated personal experience: &quot;if you can&#39;t say <em>gratuit</em> correctly surely you can&#39;t know that much about finance&quot;).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My view is that we should strive, in the context of a normal conversation or discussion, to be understandable by the lay public</strong>, as experts in their fields should strive for us to understand. But to just &quot;nitpick&quot; on the fact that an expert or trained professional uses a more understandable, not perfectly accurate term, is pointless. The chances they know what they are saying are high, and that they know more than whoever is commenting even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think there is a point in such a context to do this? As it&#39;s something I hear almost daily about many fields and with many colleagues from various backgrounds complaining about this, I figured I should ask myself if maybe it actually could be useful. Am I wrong in preferring more approachable terms?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
