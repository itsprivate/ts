So if you make resisting arrest illegal, it incentivizes suspects to cooperate with their arrest.\n\nBut cops have abused this law and now interpret *any* resistance as resisting arrest.  But quite often, the suspect isn't resisting arrest, they're resisting something else.  In the case of George Floyd, he was resisting death.  In many cases, such as [this one](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/out-control-police-dog-locks-10790898), the suspect is resisting physical assault by a police dog.  Then there are cases of suspects [resisting sexual assault](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8502911/Male-motorbike-cop-accused-groping-womans-breasts-arrest-ran-red-light.html).  In cases like Breonna Taylor, her boyfriend didn't even know he was resisting police, he thought he was resisting armed invaders.  In the protests last summer, protesters were resisting being kidnapped and abused by police.\n\nIn too many cases, the police have become little more than an armed gang of thugs with no accountability.  It is perfectly reasonable to fear the police, particularly for certain demographics in certain jurisdictions.  And when you are in fear, or in pain, resistance isn't a thought out plan, it is a natural, involuntary reaction; and that shouldn't be criminalized.\n\n**EDIT**:  For the nutjobs who are trying to turn this discussion into a debate over whether Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, that's not what this CMV is about and there's no way I'm changing my view about that.
