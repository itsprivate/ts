Basically it is a route to take in a civil lawsuit (usually in small claims courts). and while this is kind of barbaric and primitive, it is outlawed in most counties/cities here in Georgia. Both Bibb County and Peach County influencers are petitioning to get rid of this legal option in their counties, because they feel that it is being abused for people to rob stubborn elderly men. And while that does happen, it is rare. I want my view to be changed because I&#39;m trying to become more religious and support less violence, but I feel that if both parties agree to settle a matter in a non-lethal combat instance, they should be able to. And no, juveniles do not have this legal option.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
