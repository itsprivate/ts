Stablecoin issuers do not undergo proper audits, nor do they comply with banking regulations because they do not consider themselves banks.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>This is a short comparison of stablecoins to banks, but it gets the point across. The mechanics behind stablecoins are <strong>identical</strong> to the mechanics behind a bank. Crypto enthusiasts and techbros love to tout stablecoins as this new invention, but they aren&#39;t a new concept at all. Every single bank is its own stablecoin, just not a blockchain one. </p>\n\n<p>The only innovation here is making a blockchain bank while pretending it isn&#39;t a bank to avoid legislation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
