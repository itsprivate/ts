Most of the military will never see combat in their life, and if they do it is because they signed up knowing that they could die on the job due to the position they signed up for. </p>\n\n<p>The pay and perks are generally pretty good if you are in combat, and this reflects the danger that you are signing up for. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a surprise! So why do we still do this seemingly mandatory congratulatory back rub in North America? Especially when all the combative wars we are currently involved in are unnecessary for the safety of our continent and countries.</p>\n\n<p>Open to discussion why this is still an important thing to do. To me it seems grandfathered in from wars gone by and doesn&#39;t truly reflect what is going in modern North America</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add:</p>\n\n<p>Instead of downvoting me, leave a comment to help change my view! Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
