Do you remember what it was like before you were born? Exactly. The baby won't feel or know a thing.\"\n\n\"But YOU had that baby, YOU need to know the consequences.\"\n\n\"Ok so do you just want to punish me for having a child and force me to raise it? I'll just probably leave it at the adoption center or orphanage. Besides, that doesn't help either since there are already 160 million orphaned kids in the world and it doesn't help that I added one to that list.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you're going to come from the perspective of religion and that the baby has a soul too, well guess what, it's a baby. Aborting it means it gets a free pass to heaven since it literally hasn't existed long enough to commit any sins.\n\n*\"But how about this, we go pro-life, but we also make it so the biological father MUST raise the child with the mother as well.\"*\n\nYeah, no can do king. When you force the father and the mother to care for something they didn't want, chances are they won't do much of the caring part. That kid could now grow up in an abusive home where both parents blame the child for something it didn't chose.\n\nThere are literally so many pros to pro-choice that I can name, and not even a handful I could name for pro-life.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\-Children won't be left at orphanages, meaning that's one less child to the 156 million orphans worldwide.\n\n\\-Women get to have a second chance at life, and aborting the kid will stop that person from going down a self destructive path.\n\n\\-If you're religious, that would-have-been kid gets a free pass to heaven.\n\n\\-YAY LESS ANNOYING LITTLE SHITS THAT HAVE TO SCREAM AND THROW TANTRUMS AT THE MALL WHEN IM EATING PIZZA\n\n\\-Helps lower global overpopulation\n\n\\-If the condom breaks or it's an accidental pregnancy, families won't be burdened by the addition of another child.\n\n**Pro life pros:**\n\n\\-Child gets to live\n\n\\-Scares people into being more responsible about sex and using contraceptives\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm hope I do not come off as a radical pro-choice feminazi, but believe me, I just took the time to examine both arguments over and over again in my head, but then I realized that 1 side is deeply flawed while the other is full of pros.\n\nI don't see how anyone here can have a solid argument against this, but if you do, please debate me on why. I'd love to be proven corrected, but my point seems pretty solid.\n\nChange my view, folks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Why is everyone trying to use my logic to justify killing people in their sleep/braindead people? I'm only talking about fetuses not whole ass grown adult human beings.",
