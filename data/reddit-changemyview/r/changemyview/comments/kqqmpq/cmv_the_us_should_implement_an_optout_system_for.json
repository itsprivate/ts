By letting people opt-out, those whose religion is against it or simply don&#39;t want to don&#39;t have to. With the current opt-in system, many people who would donate their organs don&#39;t because they never get the time to fill out all the paperwork or are too lazy to do so. With an opt-out system, you wouldn&#39;t have to fill out any paperwork to have your organs donated, it would just happen automatically.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
