Using examples such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters, but while these were tragic, this doesn’t represents nuclear safety and the benefits that nuclear power has as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>75% of Frances energy comes from nuclear power plants and a lot of Sweden’s power is the same, I don’t know much about European power plants, but I haven’t heard much of any accidents occurring in these areas, at least nowhere near the level of others. And while climate activist have sort of stopped nuclear power plants from being built in European countries it hasn’t stopped other countries from mass producing them, a example would be China that puts a new one on the grid every two to three months, supplying its citizens with plenty of energy, and it’s the same in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>So why do we see nuclear power as so dangerous, this is most likely caused by the mentioned nuclear disasters I said earlier. Fukushima while definitely a disaster, acutely didn’t reach dangerous radiation levels. While there definitely was a spike in radiation, it was actually all under the regular safety limit for most nuclear power plants. It was sadly due to mass panic that led to many deaths that occurred not too long after, helping to bring up suicide and depression rates in that time period during the mass evaluation. </p>\n\n<p>Chernobyl is another example of a terrible tragedy, and while this is definitely A terrible event with mass radiation everywhere way above the lethal limit in some areas. This was all caused by cutting corners or poor maintenance. The reason the plant cut corners was too please soviet dictators of the time as this was a part of Soviet Russia and we all know their standards were really low. But since the Soviet Union disbanded, The Russian government has tried their best to lower the radiation limits, and in fact you can now stand right outside the big dome that was put over top of the plant, and you will not be susceptible to lethal amounts of radiation. No nuclear reactor today will be built like Chernobyl, it will have some of the highest safety regulations that any can get.</p>\n\n<p>Even when you include all the deaths from major nuclear power disasters, It comes nowhere near the amount of deaths in other power fields such as Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas. It’s even almost as safe as wind and solar in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason why people don’t like nuclear power is the waste that is generated from it. But even if you collected all the nuclear waste from just America’s power plants for 60 years straight, The waste that would be generated would only fill The size of an average Walmart, which is somewhat big, but it is pretty easy to get rid of. Bury it hundreds of miles into the earth, or even just shoot it off into space with a few rockets. </p>\n\n<p>The cost is another thing that’s actually good about nuclear energy, it’s just as cheap as wind and solar, making it good for costs, and it also helps to manufacture them a lot easier. Though right now with Americans regulations, we can only build a nuclear power plant every 12 to 15 years and it can take up 6 to 7 years just to get permission to start building. </p>\n\n<p>While nuclear power can definitely be dangerous in the wrong circumstances, it is a better alternative to other forms of energy, based on its safety, Energy efficiency, and Low costs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
