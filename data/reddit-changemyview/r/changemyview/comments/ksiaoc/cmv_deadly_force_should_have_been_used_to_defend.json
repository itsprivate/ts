The defense of the seat of government is a military exigency.  Even though the Capitol Police aren't the Army, when you're at the last line of defense of the government, it should be treated as a military force situation, not merely a civilian policing situation.\n\n2. While thankfully no members of the House or Senate, or the current VP or VP elect were harmed, there was a grave risk of the kidnapping, killing, or hostage taking of senior government officials, which is something worth preventing by deadly force.\n\n3.  The Capitol Police were unable to secure the building by less than lethal means.  Non-deadly force was not doing the job. They lost control of the situation and were trying to defend an enormous complex after their initial lines were overrun by the mob.  Their failure to command the complex was complete, and resulted in the innermost and most important places in the complex being breached, with now iconic photos of rioters taking over the floor of the Senate chamber, as well as the Speaker's office. \n\nMy hesitations are:\n\n1. The Capitol Police might not have won a shootout with the mob.\n\n2.  Shooting into crowds can provoke both immediate charge/violence consequences, as well as long term political consequences.\n\n3. A gunfight might have further endangered the political leaders who I was focused on protecting.\n\nOn the whole I still at the moment think the reasons I hold this outweigh, especially in respect to the military exigency of not letting the capitol fall, but I want to hear some more voices on it.",
