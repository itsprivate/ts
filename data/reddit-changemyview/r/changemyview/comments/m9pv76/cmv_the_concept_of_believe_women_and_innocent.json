Especially with incidents like his where we know they aren’t going to be handled by actual court systems and instead are going to go to litigation and further than that will be handled by the court of public opinion where the proof of innocence seems to be astronomically high. And while I know this isn’t an actual punishment, I still don’t understand how innocence can ever actually be proven in these circumstances because past allegations will always be brought up (Derrick Rose won his civil suit and ppl mentioning his success on Twitter/ESPN follow with a “yea, but remember...”). So yea I’d love for someone to change my mind on this one, because when I tried to look this up myself google sent me right to Reddit lol.",
