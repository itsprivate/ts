To put it another way, my view doesn't challenge *whether* systems of oppression exist but rather how many on the left increasingly attempt to *counteract* those systems. I hope we can have this discussion on that basis. I'll additionally say that my personal views are progressive, but I find myself increasingly turned off by the behavior of many people on the left, which I see as intolerant.\n\nAnyway. I've had two experiences recently that have rubbed me, as a white man, the wrong way. I would say there are more experiences I've had than these, but it's good to have something concrete to work with.\n\n* The first was reading *The New York Times* [list](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/arts/breakout-stars-actors.html) of 2020's breakout stars, which seems to feature every demographic except for white men. I'll admit that this list per se is not really inflammatory; it just feels like I've seen many lists like it, that exclude white men, so it feels cumulative. It's about more than this list.\n* The second was doing a mandatory harassment training for my job, in which the only white man featured was (surprise) a fictional character who sexually harasses someone else. The training featured tons of perspectives from other demographics, but zero white men. The way they pointed out that men can also face sexual harassment was by highlighting that black men can be harassed.\n\nNow. What I'm not trying to say is that it's *wrong* to have diverse lists or perspectives. I'm all for it, and I certainly don't want to see a list of \"2020's breakout white male stars.\" If, of all men, black men are disproportionately impacted by sexual assault, we *should* mention that – but we shouldn't *only* mention that black men get sexually assaulted.\n\nBut, omissions like these are clearly deliberate – they come from people who are passionate about inclusion and diversity and stress the importance of representation. Frankly, it makes me feel like I'm not welcome in a movement I believe in.\n\nIn my view, it's hypocritical to stress the importance of including everyone but exclude white men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Anticipated Responses**\n\nI'll provide some counterarguments I anticipate to save us time.\n\n* *White men make up the majority of x-group so they don't need to be mentioned*. I don't think it works to create a group and say, but the white men are over there, so there's no problem. Studies show that when members of the majority are encouraged to participate in movements, they're more successful. I would say that white men need to be shown their own perspective in say, diversity trainings, and not just portrayed as the harasser.\n* *White men have been in power forever, so it's okay to exclude them now.* This line of thinking confuses me. It comes across as a justification of prejudiced behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edits**\n\n* I am sorry if it takes me a while to respond to your comment. I am trying to respond thoughtfully and there are more comments coming in now.\n* Also, all the trolls can fuck right off. Thanks. Thank you to those of you who are having open dialogues with me.\n* \\[Update \\~4PM PT\\] I've been at this for about two hours now and have had some really good discussions. I have to step away now but I hope I will have a chance to return to this within the next few hours. ",
