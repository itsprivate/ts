This all comes back graded. </p>\n\n<p>Now, none of this homework is hard, but this is all relative as well, and he doesn’t understand the concept of grading either, but all the parents do. The homework consists of about 90 minutes worth of work for a 4-5 year old (assuming they can concentrate straight through, this is highly unlikely in my experience).</p>\n\n<p>Until a few weeks ago his school didn’t have a TK teacher and he was just put into a kindergarten class along with all the other TK students. They’re still short a TK teacher, and this thanksgiving homework packet was labeled “kindergarten” and had activities that frankly we had to just, well, do for him because they were way beyond him. So perhaps this is just laziness and not the norm. After all I don’t have a plethora of kids in different schools. The packet took about 2 hours per day over 1 week. It would have taken longer if I hadn’t given up trying to teach him things that were way over his head that he hasn’t even begun learning in class.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I think this is ridiculous for this age group.
