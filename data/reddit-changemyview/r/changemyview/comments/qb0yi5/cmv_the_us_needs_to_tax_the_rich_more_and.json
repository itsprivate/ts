I think all of those are decent arguments for redistribution.</p>\n\n<p>But some people will say &quot;it&#39;s not your money, you are not entitled to it&quot; (for example, Ben Shapiro.) and that If people are poor it&#39;s because they made bad choices so now they have to deal with the consequences. As somebody who has had second chances and support (thankfully) I cannot get behind this stance even in cases where a person made some bad choices (nevermind the cases in which somebody had a string of bad luck and couldn&#39;t catch a break. </p>\n\n<p>But some people aren&#39;t swayed by the &quot;imagine if you were hungry and poor&quot; argument. So, I will make another argument: if too many people are poor and hungry and have nothing to lose, there will be an uprising. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve reached that point yet and I don&#39;t think the situation in the US is hopeless. But if things continue to worsen, I think it could reach that point. I do not believe people are just going to roll over and accept death or watch their children die from starvation.  If millions of people reach a breaking point, there will be violence. People talk about the violence of past riots, but that was public property. I&#39;m talking about private property.</p>\n\n<p>It baffles me that so many capitalists are willing to rake in millions or billions while people starve in the streets. From a humanity standpoint, but also from a survival standpoint. You can&#39;t just laugh and spit in people&#39;s faces and expect them to never hit back. Eventually, they will. </p>\n\n<p>If for no other reason than their own safety, millionares and billionares should start paying their fair share in taxes and start giving back. </p>\n\n<p>Curious to hear other people&#39;s thoughts on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
