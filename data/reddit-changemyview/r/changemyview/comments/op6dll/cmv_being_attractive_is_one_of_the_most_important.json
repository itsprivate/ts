No one is saying you have to be a 10/10 to find friends and a relationship and that&#39;s where people start rationalizing why the unattractive kid has no friends; &quot;hE DoESn&#39;t talK&quot;. So........why aren&#39;t people talking to him?</p>\n\n<p>People cannot see your personality. People see your looks and how you look determines whether they want to get to know you or not. No man is going to go into a club/bar/classroom/job and say &quot;her personality looks nice, I want to get to know her&quot;. Likewise, no woman is going to say &quot;his personality seems nice, maybe I should say hi&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is, attractive people have more friends and get into relationships easily. Not to say that those relationships last, just that looking good helps immensely, while everything is dead last.</p>\n\n<p>Unattractive people have to work twice as hard to get noticed; leave the house 24/7, play 5 instruments, be the president of an interesting club, put in all the effort in social settings, be extremely kind, even when people are jerks, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Attractive people just have to exist and not be a bad person.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
