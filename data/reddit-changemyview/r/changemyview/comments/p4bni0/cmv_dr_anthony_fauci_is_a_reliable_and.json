The CDC and Fauci did not know how effective mask wearing would be and did not want to worsen shortages for healthcare professionals, and reversed his advice when the effectiveness was proven and the supply of masks caught up to demand. </p>\n\n<p>So please CMV, or at least help me understand why a rational and informed individual would disagree with my position.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
