There are no repercussions for the women when they blatantly lie about the child’s paternity, and often it’s too late for the men to get their time or money back. Many of these men feel violated, and the child may miss out on the chance to know their true biological father. </p>\n\n<p>So what should we do to prevent these scenarios?There should be a formal notice attached to all birth certificate forms, warning the father to confirm paternity (if he expects to be the biological father) results before he signs. Paternity testing should be available onsite at most birthing centers, family planning clinics, labs testing centers, and home test available at most pharmacies. Both prenatal and postnatal test should be covered under all health insurance plans. If the presumed father doesn’t have health insurance, then he should at-least get a sliding scale discount at a clinic like Planned Parenthood to be able to pay. </p>\n\n<p>Around 30% of all DNA paternity test turn out to be negative, so this gives us an idea of how often paternity fraud MAY happen. No man should take a chance and just trust what a woman says, if he is expecting to be that child’s biological father. Men who have already assumed parental roles of a child (under expectation that they are the biological father) should also be encouraged get the DNA testing done. If they have proof of non paternity, then no child support order should be issued. </p>\n\n<p>I recognize there may be major flaws in my thought process, not sure. Change my view if you disagree with my general premise.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
