At best it possibly affects the comment&#39;s rating in the background, but it does not affect the comment&#39;s shown number of &quot;likes.&quot; While the rationale given includes things like preventing harassment and suppression, I think this is a mistake due to the appearance to the commenter or everyone seeing the comment. You could have a comment that has 10 likes, but would ordinarily also have 100 dislikes, yet people will only be able to see that there are 10 likes. I don&#39;t like the idea that I could get an extremely wrong impression of what other people think of a comment I make, just because it looks &quot;upvoted.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I think something better would be similar to how Reddit does points for <em>posts</em> (not comments), where a Youtube comment with a positive like ratio will show &quot;+number&quot; for the difference of likes over dislikes, whereas dislikes can reduce the point number to zero, but cannot go negative. I am welcoming any reason from others why I should CMV here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
