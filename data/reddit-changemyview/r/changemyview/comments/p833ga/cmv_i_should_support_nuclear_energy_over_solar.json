And when people say we should be focusing on all, I see that as just people not investing all we can in Nuclear energy. </p>\n\n<p>There is a roadmap to achieve vast majority of your nation&#39;s energy needs. France has been getting 70% or their electricity from generations old Nuclear power plants.</p>\n\n<p>Solar are very variable. I&#39;ve read the estimates that they can only produce energy in adequate conditions 10%-30% of the time. </p>\n\n<p>There is a serious question of storing the energy. The energy grid is threatened by too much peak energy. And while I think it&#39;s generally a good think to do to install on your personal residence. I have much more reservations for Solar farms. </p>\n\n<p>The land they need are massive. You would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor. </p>\n\n<p>The land needs be cleared, indigenous animals cleared off. To make way for this diluted source of energy? If only Nuclear could have these massive tradeoffs and have the approval rating of 85%.</p>\n\n<p>It can be good fit on some very particular locations. In my country of Australia, the outback is massive, largely inhabitable, and very arid. </p>\n\n<p>Singapore has already signed a deal to see they get 20% of their energy from a massive solar farm in development. </p>\n\n<p>I support this for my country. In these conditions, though the local indigenous people on the land they use might not. </p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s criminal any Solar farms would be considered for arable, scenic land. Experts say there is no plan to deal with solar panels when they reach their life expectancy. And they will be likely shipped off to be broken down, and have their toxins exposed to some poor African nation. </p>\n\n<p>I will not go on about the potential of Nuclear Fusion, or just using Thorium. Because I believe entirely in current generation Nuclear power plants. In their efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. </p>\n\n<p>Germany has shifted from Nuclear to renewables. Their energy prices have risen by 50% since then. Their power costs twice as much as it does for the French. </p>\n\n<p>The entirety of people who have died in accidents related to Nuclear energy is 200. Chernobyl resulted from extremely negligent Soviet Union safety standards that would have never happened in the western world. 31 people died. </p>\n\n<p>Green mile island caused no injuries or deaths. And the radioactivity exposed was no less than what you would get by having a chest x-ray. </p>\n\n<p>Fukushima was the result of a tsunami and earthquake of a generations old reactor. The Japanese nation shut down usage of all nuclear plants and retrofitted them to prevent even old nuclear plants suffering the same fate.</p>\n\n<p>I wish the problems with solar panels improve dramatically. Because obviously we aren&#39;t moving towards the pragmatic Nuclear option. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t see the arguments against it. That some select plants are over-budget? The expertise and supply chain were left abandoned and went to other industries for a very long time.</p>\n\n<p>The entirety of the waste of Switzerland fits in a single medium sized room. It&#39;s easily disposed of in metal barrels covered in concrete.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
