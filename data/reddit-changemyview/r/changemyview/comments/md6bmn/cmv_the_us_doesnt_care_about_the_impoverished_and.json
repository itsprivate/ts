Reading the reddit comments made me realize that no one in positions of power really care about the people at the bottom of the pit. The honest truth is greed will come before anything else and at any cost even to the bottom line. You can throw all the numbers and economics you want, but everything will remain status quo. The only way I see any sort of drastic change to help the people who are most in need is if a civil war happened. Sounds stupid and naive and edgy, but I honestly don't see any other way to get the people at the top to change their minds. You can't pull money out of politics because corporations and billionaires have the money and power to overthrow the government and hold them like puppets. So the only way to fix this is to dismantle and rebuild the structure of governance from the ground up to earn back the trust of the people and hold the corporations and the rich accountable for their actions. If they don't make radical changes to fix the systemic issues of the government helping the poor get out of poverty to match modern times, nothing will get done and poor people will remain poor and the rich will continue to become richer.",
