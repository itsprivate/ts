  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Public schools have multiple functions: keeping kids off the street, socialization for kids, imparting lessons of society on them, and obviously education. According to <a href=\"https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from-school.html\">Lawyers.com</a>, suspension is pretty much boiled down to either violent activities (fighting, harassment, possession of weapons, etc), use or possession of drugs, or stealing. </p>\n\n<p>Out of school suspension solves none of the issues while taking away literally all of the benefits/purposes of school. By not allowing a student to attend classes, they obviously aren’t learning, in many cases they aren’t monitored at home because parents have to work, they aren’t socializing with school friends, and they may socialize with worse influences. </p>\n\n<p>Suspension isn’t really meant to rehabilitate its a detrimental punishment akin to solitary confinement which according to one study has lead to prisoners being 3.2x more likely to self harm while incarcerated, so clearly not a great thing. (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement#Self-harm\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement#Self-harm</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Doing this makes zero sense, especially considering high schools all around the world just did a full year of classes online via zoom. Simply have the OSS kids come into school being monitored by a teacher on duty (similar to detention) and have them complete their classes there. Depending on the severity of their actions, additional punishments like classes on things applicable to what they did or community service driven activities to put their time to good use would be far more useful than just sending them home potentially unmonitored to do who knows what. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if the “crime” is so serious they could have school mandated psychologist meetings or something similar to address the problem, or the same could apply to repeat offenders. Lower income families are less likely to be able to afford mental health care, and more likely to act out, so providing them a healthy outlet would be a way to kill 2 birds with one stone in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Even using recorded lectures would be far more beneficial than the system we currently use though I didn’t think of this at first for some reason, even thought it may be a better option.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
