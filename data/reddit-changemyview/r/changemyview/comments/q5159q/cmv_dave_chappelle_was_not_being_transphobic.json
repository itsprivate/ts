And the second part that he wants to emphasize (or what i believe he want to emphasize) is that, treating the trans community as something that is extremely fragile, and that is unable to handle jokes or critics, will only bring harm upon the community, joking about controversies is an excellent tool to normalize something, trans people are human beings, that are having a human experience (that of felling dysphoria, and wanting to transition), treating then like they are made of glass or that they a sick with &quot;trangenderism&quot; won&#39;t help them, and will only perpetuate the state of alienation that the trans community is in right now. (were trans people are seem as alien, or foreign.) </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seem people say that, they felt disgusted when he said that he identifies with terfs (trans exclusionary feminists) in his words &quot;trans people are to woman, what black face is to black people&quot;\nNow there is 2 possible interpretations of this, the 1 is that, black face was used a way to diminish black people, and trans woman diminish biological woman (i hope that is the preferred term to refer to someone  born with 2 x chromosomes). \n The other way to see this is, by diminishing the value  of the authenticity of a trans woman, you are by consequence also diminishing the authenticity of biological woman (again hope that is an acceptable way to refer to someone born with 2 x chromossomes), so by normalizing trans people, and by stoping seeing them as somehow inferior to a woman. (You might now refer to what i wrote above about trans women not being &quot;complete women&quot; (or men) to witch i answer you with, just because they will never be biologically born a woman or man, doesn&#39;t mean that we have to treat then differently from their preferred gender identity), you are as well medicating that felling that terfs feel about trans women.</p>\n\n<p>Also i think he said &quot;I&#39;m a terf&quot; with the same connotation he does when he says something in the lines of &quot;i hate white people&quot; or &quot;i love controversies&quot; he is not being serious, he is identifying himself with a bad group of people in order to achieve humor, kinda like &quot;I&#39;m not racist but...&quot; kinda jokes. (At least that is my interpretation of it.</p>\n\n<p>He also went to dedicate the ending of the show to daphne a trans comedian that according to him, was not only his friend, she was his tribe, he goes on to refer to her as the &quot;manliest person he ever met&quot; obviously he meant that as flatter, in the same way someone would say something in the lines of &quot;my girlfriend is my best bro&quot; so i don&#39;t believe he misgendered her.</p>\n\n<p>He concludes the show by saying he is done with lgbtq+ jokes until he can be sure that the community is laughing with him.</p>\n\n<p>So, am misinterpreting things? Are the opinions i expressed here ofencive and/or transphobic? \nI posted questions in similar lines explaining my point of view in the trans subreddit and they just straight up banned me, and then preceded to ban me  in other lgbtq+ communities, witch I&#39;m not mad about it, just a little sad, because i was only asking people to not rush to conclusions based on headlines, and comments of other redditors, and instead watch the show for themselves and formulate their own decision.   I&#39;m just trying to be a better person, and a better ally to the trans community. Thank you for reading, and possibly answering.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It is currently 5 am for me, and im here since 1am, im going to sleep now, and although, i didn&#39;t change my opinion, i for sure expanded it, and was able to understand better those that disagree, for that i thank you, thanks to those that were civil, took their time to write a genuine answer, and to those that forwarded the discution. You all have a great one, be the best human that you can be, take care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
