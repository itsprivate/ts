Now, as a disclaimer, while many of these criticisms apply to all cattle farming, it's most relevant to industrial cattle farming.\n\nFirst, it destroys ecosystems. It encourages farmers to constantly expand and as a result of that they consistently encroach upon wilderness and the natural world, removing ecosystems and areas that should be left as they are. This also encourages farmers to kill off local predators. When territory is taken away, the food animals like deer move too. In turn this causes the predators to either move with them, or start hunting the new prey items, the cattle, which leads to them getting shot. even if the local prey items stay in the area, the very presence of cattle puts the predators in danger, because then predators will probably end up hunting cattle anyways. they’re animals, so they don’t have the foresight to think what will result in them getting shit, they just think about what’s easiest to hunt and what’s in front of their faces, and it’ll typically be cows. and while I think that not killing wild animals for simply being wild animals is enough of a reason to massively reduce cattle farming, it goes deeper than that. This killing of predators often leads to those predators becoming endangered, allowing their prey items to thrive, which leads to them taking over and destroying the ecosystem even more. This is currently happening throughout the United States, but it presents the greatest threat in the Amazon, where miles upon miles of rainforest are being cut down for cattle farming.\n\nSecondly, the cows themselves cause plenty of damages. Most notably, they poop a lot. And of course all animals poop, but when it's such a large number of animals concentrated in one area, it builds up. It either goes into water supply, killing of local species, or it enters wells making the water impossible to drink. if it's not dumped into water, then it's left to sit on land, or the animals have to live in it.\n\nThirdly, Global Warming. Cattle produce a lot of greenhouse gases. And, before I get into this, I'm not debating Global Warming. If you don't believe in it, please do some research into it. If you want to message me about it go for it, I can't promise I'll answer, but I probably will unless I'm busy. So, cows produce greenhouse gases. They burp methane and it's released by their waste.\n\nLastly, mass farming is really inhumane. Small farms probably do much better at this, but for mass produced beef and dairy, the cows just have horrible living conditions.\n\nJust one last reminder, this is primarily about industrial farming. While it is somewhat applicable to all cattle farming, industrial farming is the greatest example of this.\n\nIn case anybody was wondering, my sources are [here](https://sentientmedia.org/cattle-farming/) and [here](https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/stem-in-context/cows-methane-and-climate-change).",
