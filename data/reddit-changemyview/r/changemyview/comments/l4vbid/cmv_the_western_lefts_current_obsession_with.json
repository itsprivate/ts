  "selftext": "I'm a reading Maoism by Julia Lovell, and the chilling descriptions of \"self-criticism\" and the social isolation of those that did not agree with the Communist Party's current thoughts had me thinking that there are parallels to what we see today - a not very nuanced and ideological obsession with \"privilege\" purity that is counter-productive and almost a distraction from the actual issues of economic and social capital imbalance. I feel like the powerful can easily use identity politics and how it instantly requires you to either be \"pure\" or you are 100% to sow discord in the working class and keep themselves in power. It also does not seem to be very sophisticated intellectually and does not really put forward any solutions to economic unfairness other than \"the majority and privileged are wrong, and you are 100% right if you are not them\".\n\nI know I'm wrong, but it frustrates me that so much political and social energy is spent arguing about these things when such huge inequalities exist between the super wealthy and everyone else.\n\nEDIT- came back to a whole load of responses!\nThanks everyone for responding - I have really enjoyed the discussions created and my mind has definitely been changed. I think I (I will say a white, male from the west but not the US) have this perception as most of my friends are quite outspokenly “woke” but I also don’t feel like they are willing to sacrifice their actual privilege and make the very large economic changes needed to make an equitable future for everyone - so that’s why I’ve felt a little frustrated about this topic as I feel I get shouted down for discussion about anything except privilege, or that as a middle class white male I don’t have a part in the conversation about equality at all. Thank you all for reinforcing my belief that we can make this world better, and that talking about identity is part of that - as long as those entrenched in power do not take the conversation (as many of you have pointed out - the right is obsessed with identity politics and perhaps I have fallen for that trap myself!) and use it to turn us against ourselves. But I would warn that I have sensed many like myself being turned away from their ideals by the feeling that they might get shouted down for any opinion they have, even if they just want to discuss it in an open forum and understand why it’s wrong - as I said, it was potentially a reaction from my place of privilege that I felt that the identity politics discussions were a trap. I’m glad that I’ve had this conversation to help those who feel like I did realise that this is an important part of the conversation. Thanks everyone and peace !",
