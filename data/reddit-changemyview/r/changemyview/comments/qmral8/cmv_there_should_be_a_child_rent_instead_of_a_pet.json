I work maintenance at an apartment and people with kids get significantly more noise complaints than people with pets. Their units are also almost always worse than per owners’ units on move out. Color on the walls, water damage, blinds ripped off, cracks in windows, etc,. It’s actually pretty uncommon for us to discover substantial pet damage in our units, and yet, we charge these people premiums for owning these pets. </p>\n\n<p>Now, before anyone says it’s because the units have to be cleaned of pet fur and such, I’ll just stop you there because all units are cleaned 100% identically regardless of whether or not the units contained pets. The justification for charging them more rent is the “risk” of damage which they almost never cause. </p>\n\n<p>Children are way worse than pets in almost every circumstance from a renting perspective, and the parents are the ones who should be paying a premium, not Jim and his cat that sleeps all day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
