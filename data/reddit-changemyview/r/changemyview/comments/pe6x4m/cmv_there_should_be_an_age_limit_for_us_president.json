I think we need some young blood, most people retire at 65-70.  Why should they be running the country, when we’ve 100% had presidents before that had started their cognitive decline while still holding the nuclear football?  I would almost rather at 28 year old in charge then someone that’s 80.  I also don’t think that Supreme Court judges should be appointed for life till either, but that’s another argument.  I’m not being ageist, and I think there’s a million other jobs older people can do, just not this.  I also would still think it would be good if their cabinet didn’t have a age range.  It’s good to hear from people with experience.  For the record, I’m 39, for disclosure.  Credit to <a href=\"/u/Tony_Pizza_Guy\">u/Tony_Pizza_Guy</a> for the idea.  Change my mind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
