Men making the first move sometimes abuses this and uses their advantage to dominate their partner; controlling them.</p></li>\n<li><p>It doesn&#39;t matter who makes the first move anymore, as long as they  both can make it work. Its an old accustomed tradition that men always makes the first move anyways. </p></li>\n<li><p>People in the LGBT+ Community, specially ones with girl to girl relationships. Many of them succeeded fought their rights to it. This proves that women are capable of making the first move. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Basically, I&#39;m putting myself on the shoes of the opposition and you as the commenter, on our side so I can somehow visualize how our debate would go; I guess its like flipping the chessboard around so I can think of ways to counter them.</p>\n\n<p>There are more but I can&#39;t put them into words properly. Change my view!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
