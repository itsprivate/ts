I have found him to be an incredibly thoughtful, genuine and honest man with integrity that is barely seen at any level of society today. Every answer or statement that he makes is concise, direct and are his honest beliefs. Again, a total unicorn in the public spectrum these days.</p>\n\n<p>Every single person that has debated or interviewed him has literally spent the whole allotted time to put racist, homophobic, misogynistic or transphobic words in his mouth to get themselves a 30 second soundbyte of the devil himself in order to get your click for attention and ad revenue. EVERY DEBATE OR INTERVIEW is an endless stream of him carefully and precisely giving his views just to have an infantile rebuttal of &quot;so what you&#39;re saying is &lt;insert something racist/sexist/transphobic that has nothing to do with the point he just made&gt;. This is then proceeded with him having to repeatedly say &quot;no, that isn&#39;t what I&#39;m saying at all&quot;. Over and over and over again. </p>\n\n<p>Every single article slating him that I&#39;ve seen has been either duplicitously edited or completely disingenuously removed from context, and every single excerpt can be traced back to the actual conversation with its full context and it is always mind-blowing how far removed it is from the article. In many cases I believe it&#39;s slander/libelous aand an atrocious glimpse at society as a whole. Witch hunts have not ended in the modern world, they have just become verbal instead of physical.</p>\n\n<p>From over 100 hours of trying to find a smoking gun in his talks and lectures I have come up with the square root of nothing that could justify the public mauling that he recieved worldwide. And I now genuinely belive he cares more about the wellbeing of society than his critics. I&#39;m honestly appalled and believe that 90% of his critics opinions would turn on a dime if they actually watched one of his lectures instead of glossing over the baseless headlines. So,</p>\n\n<p>Change My View.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
