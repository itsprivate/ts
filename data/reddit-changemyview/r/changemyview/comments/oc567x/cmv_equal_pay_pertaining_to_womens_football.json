But in the context of sports, I dont see equal pay in women&#39;s football being realistic in the current women&#39;s market. </p>\n\n<p>From my general knowledge of sports. Salary for players are usually determined by the total revenue of the league divided between the player&#39;s salary, the owners, and the league&#39;s administration. As an example, the NFL distributes is revenue by giving 49% to the profits for player&#39;s salary.</p>\n\n<p>So I believe the real reason women don&#39;t get equally paid in football is mainly due to the lack of revenue in women&#39;s soccer. The best women&#39;s soccer player wants to be paid the same as Messi or ronaldo. But the question is do they generate as much money as those two soccer giants? I believe the lack of revenue generated in women&#39;s football leagues will limit their salaries. They need more demand where people want to pay just as much as mens league to watch and of course have the same amount of people willing to pay the same price.</p>\n\n<p>I think the whole movement seems weak because by paying the same wage as men they are bankrupting their own league. Where is the money coming from? Because they don&#39;t generate enough revenue for equal pay.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, women&#39;s tennis generates high revenue. There is a reason they are the highest paid female athletes. They bring in fans and money. Not quite equal to the male tennis wage, but the gap is much smaller compared to other sports. Hence, revenue generated = higher salaries.</p>\n\n<p>If this entire movement was based on unfair percentage split then I am supporting them. But the issue is the absolute revenue is just so low compared to men. Sports is essentially entertainment. You get paid by the demand of people wanting to spend to watch you. Women&#39;s football league just doesn&#39;t have the demand comparable to the men&#39;s league. They should focus on increasing that demand and revenue rather than asking for something that is not even available. Cause there is not enough money available to pay all the women football players the same as men.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
