  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Nowadays, women who enter religious orders must be eighteen and leaving at any time is permissible, even if you&#39;ve sworn your vows. Dispensation is a very real thing and even then, fully joining takes years (I know someone who just got her final vows and she started in 2007). There are dozens of women&#39;s orders and many of them don&#39;t even wear the habit or wimple anymore. There is no deep symbolism to the outfit itself - it&#39;s just what women wore back in the Middle Ages; some orders changed the uniform, others did not. I know nuns who wear the full ensemble and I know nuns who wear normal clothes - neither sees the other as being any lesser for their different apparel.</p>\n\n<p>The hijab is directly mandated by the hadiths (if you are a Quranist, it&#39;s more open to interpretation), which make it clear that women who do not observe it are sinning. The whole modesty thing is a modern excuse - it came along because Umar (2nd Rashidun caliph) was complaining about Sawdah (Muhammad&#39;s wife between Khadija and Aisha) arousing him, and this was the compromise instead of women being under house arrest. The most conservative views say the hijab is much more than a headscarf - even a woman&#39;s voice or something as simple as a handshake are considered part of her nakedness.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never seen any Catholics threatening random women on social media with hellfire for not wearing a mantilla, but i&#39;ve seen lots of victim blaming with Muslim women who aren&#39;t dong it &quot;properly.&quot; I&#39;m sure there are Muslim women who wear it of their own volition, but at the same time, I am sure there are plenty who don&#39;t and aren&#39;t saying anything because of social/religious pressure. Lastly, you cannot tell me that small children who wear the hijab are giving their consent.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: A nun&#39;s habit isn&#39;t so much a religious garb as it is a uniform for a career choice. The hijab is very much connected with a subconscious desire to censor women and sexualize them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
