I mean no harm and don’t intend on offending anyone, this is just a concept I genuinely just can’t wrap my head around.</p>\n\n<p>Growing up I was into “things for boys” like cars, sports and video games. All of witch my mom hated me liking because they weren’t things a girl should be into. She would constantly tell me to act more feminine, wear makeup, wear dresses, grow your hair long etc. I started to think that maybe I should just be a guy at that point, simply because I acted more masculine than other girls. But the more I thought about it I realized I didn’t want to be a guy, I love being a woman, I just like masculine things and that’s ok. That point I’m trying to get at here is what exactly makes someone feel like a man or a woman? Is it determined by interests? If so, is this not in fact reinforcing the idea of gender roles? In the LGBTQ+ community, we try to dismantle gender roles. But now for example if a man realizes that he is into feminine things like makeup and dresses, he will transition to a woman or maybe even become gender fluid. Why does he feel the need to make this change? This brings me back to my point where I think that this idea reinforces gender roles. If you really didn’t believe in gender roles why can’t that man just stay as a feminine male if “interests do not determine gender”. What exactly is making them feel as if they should be a woman? .... gender roles. If gender roles didn’t exist I just don’t think their would be any people changing their gender because they feel like another. </p>\n\n<p>Another point I want to bring across is that the concept of being non-binary also reinforces gender roles/stereotypes. Choosing to be neither basically proves that each gender has its specific roles and that you just don’t fit into one “bubble”. I deeply wish to get rid of gender roles/stereotypes but I feel that the idea of non-binaryism and transgenderism can be counterintuitive. </p>\n\n<p>Side note: I apologize if this is offensive, I’ll delete if it is. Also sorry if there’s grammatical mistakes or anything, English isn’t my first language😅.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My mind has been changed loll, that was pretty quick, I just lacked some knowledge on the topic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
