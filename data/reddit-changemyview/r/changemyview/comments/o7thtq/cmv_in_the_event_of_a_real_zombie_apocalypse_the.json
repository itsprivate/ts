(Sad to change such a vital piece of info, but a user made a brilliant point on how it would be self-contained if it was instantaneous) Edit: 100% infection rate. All of them should have dull intelligence. Their speed, however, is fast. *as in they can run. In the end, they are still vulnerable to wearing down after a year or so. To kill these monsters, it would need a shot to the brain.

It has been an idea so heavily fancied, large portions of the population would already be mentally prepared and know what to do.</li>\n<li>Even if whole countries are torn to the bones by zombies, even if a single country survives it will be able to launch a worthy counterattack. Taking superpowers like the US and Russia, for example, as long as either of them are able to semi-effectively repel the zombies and adapt, the zombies would be fcked.</li>\n<li>One of my pet peeves is the portrayal of many militaries in zombie films. From movies that originated from all across the world, the military is somewhat useless. At the end of the day, the main character is usually shown to be even more capable than the military. This is far from the truth. I doubt any zombies could truly wipe out any decent military.</li>\n<li>There are already contingency plans. This one relates to topic 1 and 3. At this point in time, many people and even governments already know how to deal with the apocalypse.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
