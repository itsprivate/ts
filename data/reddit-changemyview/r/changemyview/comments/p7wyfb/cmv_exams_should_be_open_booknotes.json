Memorizing the material for an exam is not a good way in learning the material whereas having an open book exam makes learning the materials much easier. </p>\n\n<p>All exams should be open resources. It increases note taking skills that are actually used in life and the work field and decrease exam stress. It&#39;s not fair to automatically assume that all students can retain a mass amount of information. </p>\n\n<p>Exams should be applicable based and not a memory test. You retain more information by actually doing research and learning the materials than cramping X amount of information then pouring it out onto a test and forget what you learned as soon as you turn it in. </p>\n\n<p>The whole point is to learn the materials, not just memorize information that you will forget. Not everyone can retain information well so by using resources given to you/using outside resources you gain a better understanding/different view of the material which will help you solve a problem that you don&#39;t know the answer to.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
