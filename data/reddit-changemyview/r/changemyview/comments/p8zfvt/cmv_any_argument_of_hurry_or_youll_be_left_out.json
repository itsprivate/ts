Be viable! Revolution is coming! </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a clear sign of a first in first out mindset. It&#39;s a pump and dump. Create a system, first people to get into it reap the huge rewards, and then at some point it ends and those left are holding worthless pet rocks or furbies in cyberspace. I&#39;m not saying you CAN&#39;T make money getting in at other times, you absolutely can as certain people pump it all up to make money. But that&#39;s speculation/gambling, all based on a future expectation of value.</p>\n\n<p>Which is NOT what will make a successful alternative currency or trade/contract vehicle! A sign of a successful one of those is a stable valuation that it doesn&#39;t MATTER if I get in later! It&#39;s not about investment in an imaginary system, it&#39;s about exchanging value! Hell, someone could launch the new Online(TM) coin for the onlyfans stuff going on now to solve the whole mess - you would transfer from $ to O coins, and back out, but not have any reason to stay in it except that you could buy a cheeseburger with the remainder next. It would only be successful if people AREN&#39;T trying to do large scale coin arbitrage where they think there is some inherent value. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we don&#39;t all want to have an O, anyone who says you are going to miss out is pitching a scam where the first people in that monopolize something, want to be paid off for inventing/controlling it to start.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
