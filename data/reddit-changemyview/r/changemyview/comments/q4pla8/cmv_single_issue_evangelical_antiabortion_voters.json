Isn’t that hypocritical?</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the answer is always ‘that’s the Old Testament, we only focus on the new, which is all about love.’</p>\n\n<p>I don’t buy that because my understanding of the New Testament is that abortion isn’t even specifically referenced. And even if you believe there is a way to twist some passages into being about abortion, if you lived the rest of your life that close to the Bible’s teachings you would do nothing but help poor people and give away all of your possessions to help others less fortunate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
