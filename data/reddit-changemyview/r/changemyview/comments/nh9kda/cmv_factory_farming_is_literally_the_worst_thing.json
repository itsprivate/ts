  "selftext": "For the purposes of this post, \"thing\" refers to a single system / event / occurrence.  Of course factory farming is less bad than factory farming plus me stubbing my toe, but factory farming plus me stubbing my toe is not a single \"thing.\"  Similarly, the Holocaust, American slavery, the Armenian Genocide, etc. are all considered single \"things,\" but hatred / violence in general are not.\n\nOk, here we go.  Every year, humans kill around 50 (+-10) billion land animals, the overwhelming majority of whom have lived on factory farms all their lives.  These animals are effectively subject to ongoing torture.  I don't want to go into all the details, but here are 2 examples.  First, in the pork industry, pigs live in close quarters, in farrowing crates so small they can't turn around, and sometimes in their own feces.  This induces phycological problems that sometimes lead them to bite each others' tails.  To prevent this, pigs have their tails cut off and their teeth ripped out of their mouths with no anesthetic a few weeks after they're born.  And secondly, in the beef industry, cows' horns pose a risk to the farmers and the other cows, so factory farmers apply hot irons or torches to the cows heads' to permanently stunt their horns.  I'll go into more detail if necessary but this should paint enough of a picture of the way factory farmed animals are treated.  They're subject to unfathomable cruelty and violence from the day they're born until the day they're killed.\n\nThere aren't even 8 billion humans alive on the planet today.  If 50 billion people started existing and being tortured, it would be the worst thing to ever happen, by far.  So the next part of the argument requires the moral importance of farm animals to be compared to that of humans.\n\nLet's start with a less daunting task, comparing the moral value of 2 humans.  We'll look at 2 hypothetical people with very different circumstances.  The first person is a scientist who has just discovered the cure for cancer, but he hasn't told anyone yet.  He's currently running to his lab to spread the good news and start producing the cure right away.  The second person is a 99 year old who's lived a good life and is on his death bed, about to die peacefully.  The moral value of the scientist is higher than the moral value of the old dude because the scientist has a greater potential to make the world a better place, more years ahead of him etc.  But the old dude getting punched would be just as immoral as the scientist getting punched, because they would suffer the same amount.  With respect to the pain of being punched, differences in intelligence, life expectancy, capacity to do good, etc. aren't relevant.  The only thing that's relevant is the pain suffered by the person who was punched.  Kapish?  Great.\n\nNow let's just apply the same logic to farm animals.  People live longer than farm animals, we're more sophisticated, we have a greater capacity to make the world a better place, etc.  If given the choice between saving a person and saving a pig, most of us would choose the person.  HOWEVER, pigs suffer just like humans, and so torturing a pig is just as bad as torturing a human.  When a pig is being tortured, differences in life expectancy or intelligence don't matter at all.  The only thing that matters is the pain the pig experiences.\n\nPhilip Wollen captures this idea really succinctly.  \"When we suffer, we suffer as equals.  And in their capacity to suffer, a dog is a pig, is a bear, is a boy.\"\n\nBased on that, it's my position that torturing farm animals is just as bad as doing the same thing to humans.  But let's suppose you don't accept that view, and you think it's 100x worse to torture a person than to torture another animal.  That seems to be a pretty dumb position, but let's run with it for the sake of discussion.  Even with that assumption, just 1 year of factory farming is still as bad as 500 million people being tortured.  That's equivalent to over 10 Holocausts, 10 Armenian Genocides, and 130 years of American slavery combined.\n\nWhat if we accept the position that the suffering of a farm animal is just as bad as the suffering of a person?  In that case, an hour and 10 minutes of factory farming is about as bad as the Holocaust, and a week of factory farming is about as bad as 300 years of American slavery.\n\nBest I can figure, that's the worst thing that's ever happened, by far.
