As an European I find it very weird when people from the states discuss online about racism and call themselves japanese just because their parents are japanese, they have never lived in Japan, they don&#39;t know anything about the culture, but you can find them discussing that a samurai videogame is highly offensive.\nThen you find actual japanese people sharing how cool the game is and how much do they love it.\nI find it very hypocrite, and while I understand someone wanting to know more about their family roots and culture, I do not understand why do they think they can speak for that entire ethnicity/country/society.\nTo me, they are as foreigners as the ones they are calling out!</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing out? So please tell me. Would love to have other views in this matter.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
