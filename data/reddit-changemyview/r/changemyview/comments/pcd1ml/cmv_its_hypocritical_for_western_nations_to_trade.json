They created ISIS and fund the terrorist group. Saudi Money funds the Islamic state, Saudi citizens fight for them in mass, and the Wahhabism government turns a blind eye because their ideology is almost identical to ISIS.</p>\n\n<p>How we can claim to be against terrorism yet economically and militarily support the most religiously radical state in the world is sick.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of punishments that Saudi Arabia and ISIS use. Lets see if you can tell the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Group 1.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by death- Blasphemy, Acts of Homosexuality, Treason, and Murder.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Following is punishable by an undetermined number of lashes- Slander and Drinking Alcohol.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by death by stoning - Adulatory if married.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by 100 lashes- Adulatory if unmarried</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by cutting off ones right hand- Stealing</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by cutting off one foot and one hand- Banditry theft.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by death- Banditry murder and theft.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Group 2</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by death- Blasphemy, Acts of Homosexuality, Treason, and Murder.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Following is punishable by 80 lashes- Slander and Drinking Alcohol.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by death by stoning - Adulatory if married.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by 100 lashes and exile for a year- Adulatory if unmarried</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by cutting off one hand- Stealing</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by cutting off one foot and one hand- Banditry theft.</p></li>\n<li><p>The following is punishable by crucifixion- Banditry murder and theft.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am leaving the name of which one is ISIS and which one is Saudi Arabia to make a point. Both are barbaric, murderous groups the only difference is one took over a state and got legitimately recognized. Removing all support from Saudi Arabia ends a lot of Terrorism because the money source would be cut off.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
