Men have to fear retaliation when they dare to fight back in self defense, which may lead to men sustaining critical injuries from women when they didn’t have to. This is not fair, all genders should be encouraged to protect themself from violence, no matter what gender their attacker is.</p>\n\n<p>Exceptions to my view are when a man’s form of self-defense is brutally wailing on a woman. He should use enough force against her that stops the attack from continuing, nothing excessive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
