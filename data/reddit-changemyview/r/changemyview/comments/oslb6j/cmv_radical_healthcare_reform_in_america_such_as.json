A lot of people seem to start heading down that road by having a feeling that vaccines are just a way for big pharma to make more money. A lot of people in America have first hand experience with significant hospital bills or at least know several other people who have struggled to pay massive bills. The haphazard middle-man insurance industry allows for-profit medical companies to engage in scams/fraud that wouldn&#39;t be as possible under a system like UK&#39;s NHS. Without these kinds of scandals showing up all the time in the news, I think people would be more trusting of the medical industry as a whole, and there would be less anti-vax sentiment. The UK having universal healthcare as well as less apprehension over vaccines suggests there might be some truth to this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
