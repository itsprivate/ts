It almost could&#39;ve gone so wrong for me. I think not having that time to rejuvenate and fully leave a previous employer because of lack of support and career progression opportunity is tantamount to experiencing more fuck ups and even more misery.</em></p>\n\n<p>Edit: <em>I work in retail which is miserable. But in reality I can’t afford to leave and don’t have enough experience yet to work anywhere else despite having worked in a store for nearly 6 years. I also live in the UK. I apply for a 1000 jobs, and get rejected for a 1000 more. If employers were less picky on who they employ less people would feel the need to take breaks or plan redirections. I am in just a comfortable enough position to leave and hang on for a while, but not to stop working altogether. I also find it hard to have the energy to apply for new jobs when I’m so exhausted and burnt out from the job I’m stuck in. I would quit but I feel pressured not to because of high pressure professionalism standards. I’ve worked straight and never felt the need to take a ‘mental health’ or &#39;lifestyle&#39; break until I considered it recently. I’m only 23 and can usually take what comes. But sometimes it takes a toll, and gets frustrating, when companies offer little support for this kind of situation where you want to leave but feel like you have no choice, but continue to be a slave to a  miserable and unbalanced working life with little reward or benefit, that comes from it except barely being above sea level.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
