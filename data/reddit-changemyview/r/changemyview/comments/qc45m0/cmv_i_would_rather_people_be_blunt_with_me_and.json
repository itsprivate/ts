When a girl likes me they usually will “drop hints” instead of saying “I like you.” I know it isn’t easy to say that, but dropping hints makes stuff wayyyy more complicated. Also, say a girl DOESNT like me, they will usually ghost me/dry text me until I “get the message.” Nah, just tell me you don’t like me! It’s not gonna kill me to say that, and when you wait and instead try to “dry text me” or something, it just drags it out for longer than it has to!! Both guys and girls do this, I just used myself as an example. Either way though, communication works so much better than any other way of trying to get a message across to someone. It can save people from a lot of anger and sadness, but also can make it so you date that guy or girl faster! What do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
