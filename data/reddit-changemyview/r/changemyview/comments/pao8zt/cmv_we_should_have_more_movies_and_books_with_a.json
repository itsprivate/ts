People tend to relate to good and noble characters, but they won&#39;t analyze much of that character&#39;s behavior. From the producers&#39; point of view, perhaps people would be more engaged when they actually have something to dissect instead of just applauding good behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, films with negative protagonists could have a genuine informative purpose. People can learn a lot about the psychology of violent, anti-social people because the protagonist status allows them to know the character in detail. </p>\n\n<p>I think that entertainment industry should have a balanced amount of good and bad main characters, better reflecting the reality that we live in.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
