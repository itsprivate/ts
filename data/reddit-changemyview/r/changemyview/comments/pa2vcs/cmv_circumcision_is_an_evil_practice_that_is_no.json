This also means that the glans becomes dry and crusty rubbing against underwear all day, I’ve seen lots of penises and European men have much more plump and healthy looking glans. </p>\n\n<p>Also uncircumcised men last longer in bed, and are more likely to make women orgasm too, because the fore skin adds extra stimulation like a ribbed condom. </p>\n\n<p>Proponents of circumcision say it’s more aesthetic and healthier. Those are lies. It is only done for religious (Jewish) reasons. Nature does not make any mistakes and would not give me a foreskin if I did not need it. Vestigial organs do exist I admit but the foreskin and frenulum are clearly not ones as they provide protection, lubrication, and sexual pleasure.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
