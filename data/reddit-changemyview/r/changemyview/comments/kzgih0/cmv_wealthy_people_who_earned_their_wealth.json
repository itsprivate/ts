Likewise, the same argument could be used against the author himself. His arbitrary threshold for an expensive bottle is $100, however to those in a lower socioeconomic state than him, $100 is beyond expensive for a bottle of wine, and the author could have bought a $10 bottle\nand donated $90 to charity. \n\nWhile this statement in of itself is true, it fails to consider multiple factors. The author of the post does not know who the buyer of the wine is, nor do we know the author. Why is this important? \n\nWithout knowing the buyer at all, the author of the post has labeled a person a monster. It is very much possible that the buyer of the wine DOES provide to charitable causes, and given their seemingly wealthy position to be able to buy what is generally considered very expensive wine by middle / lower socioeconomical class standards, this buyer very well could be providing more to charitable causes than the author of the post ever will in their lifetime. \n\nIs this guaranteed? Of course not. But just as I have inferred my hypothetical possibility, the author has done the same but with the opposite juxtaposition. My point is, you don't know how much someone is or is not helping what you deem to be worthy monetary expenses, so it is probably better to not assume, especially when there is a non zero chance that this person could very well be contributing more than you ever might. \n\nAlso, to circle back to the title of this post from the slight tangent above, even if one is wealthy (provided it was acquired legitamately and ethically), they should be able to spend ALL of their money HOWEVER they want, provided that it does not have a direct negative impact on others.\n\nExample: an individual takes a risk, and starts their own company, where they fairly pay their employees, and grow to a be a successful individual. \n\nBecause this individual took a risk (that paid off), should they be held liable for other's problems? Plenty of people don't take this sort of risk (nothing wrong with that), but then those same people expect those who did take the risk to help them, or, expect them to donate to charitable causes, but that brings me back to my point above with the wine post. \n\nThe truth is, (I'm not a fan of it either), is our world exists on the principal of survival of the fittest. Not just in humans, but plants, animals, everything. This wasn't up to us. So in that sense, moral responsibility is not something that can be enforced at an extisential level. Again, I feel the need to emphasize that this is strictly speaking about helping others, NOT hurting. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that I believe there is a key difference between moral obligation and responsibility. As individuals, I truly to believe we can always be working towards becoming better versions of ourselves. This not only includes helping ourselves, but also helping others when we can. But this is for us to manage ourselves, and you should only hold yourself accountable for your own growth.\n\nTo summarize, I truly believe the energy people spend on hating/judging others in better positions than them could be used to focus on bettering themselves and their lives instead. And when they get to that better place, they can be the impact they want to see in the world.",
