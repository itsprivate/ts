The videos he released. Its all just an old,sad and crazy man.</p>\n\n<p>However,regarding some alleged assasination attempts i couldnt find anything, i doubt a old crazy man could survive multiple attempts at his life.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest reason why im sure that he killed himself, is the fact that he was about to be moved back to the USA for his crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Why would someone want him dead a few weeks before being faced with his crimes, possibly getting a huge prison sentence</p>\n\n<p>Im curious for the opinions and arguments that think he got killed</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
