Sometimes who I’m with affects how I present and how I feel. And other times, I am how I am, regardless of who I interact with&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Every human is exceptionally multifaceted and unique. No one fits 100% into <em>any</em> box. We use &#39;boxes&#39; as a way to order and organise an exceptionally complicated world, and in order to communicate effectively. </p>\n\n<p>What this person is describing in this article is a normal human experience, in other words, their personality. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;There are no easy answers when trying to take shortcuts when addressing genderfluid folks. The best course of action is just to ask them what they’d prefer to be called and then trying to remember to use it&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When? How often should I ask this? </p>\n\n<p>&quot;butch women cut their hair short, wear masculine clothing, and enter a room as if they own it. You see it when some transwomen carefully apply makeup, wear feminine clothing, and enter a room hoping others notice them. And you see it when some gay men dress sharp and dapper, aren’t afraid of their bubbly personalities, and enter a room loud and unafraid to show off. Gender is in everything we believe about ourselves and show the world&quot;</p>\n\n<p>What.. like, a personality?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I’ve learned to stop talking about myself with an implied apology. “Don’t even look at my clothes,” I’d say when I ran into a female friend. “I just threw something on this morning”  — because I was suddenly embarrassed that I was wearing jeans and hadn’t put on makeup&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Said literally every woman ever. Being a woman doesn&#39;t mean you have to wear frocks and make-up. Wearing jeans and no make-up doesn&#39;t make you <em>any</em> less of a woman. \nThis author is right that we shouldn&#39;t have to apologize for not looking made-up. But being &#39;pretty&#39; sometimes and being &#39;casual&#39; sometimes doesn&#39;t make us &quot;genderfluid&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I genuinely can&#39;t determine what this person is talking about if it&#39;s not personality. I wonder how homogeneous they consider literally <em>everyone else</em> to be in order to think that they&#39;re in some way so radically different that they need to create a new box and rules for themselves in society. </p>\n\n<p>If gender is innate and (most likely) due to biological factors then how can fluctuations of gender throughout the day be valid? </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe it is. CMV folks</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI&#39;d love to hear from someone who wants to change my view regarding the premise of the post. Ie: that gender differences can&#39;t occur throughout the day. \nI know that transgenderism is an interesting topic but I&#39;m really wanting to discuss <em>this</em> specific angle today</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
