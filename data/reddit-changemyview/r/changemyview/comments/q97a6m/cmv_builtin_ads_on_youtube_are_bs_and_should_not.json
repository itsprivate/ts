  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think that when YouTubers advertise their sponsors in the video, it is pretty scummy. I understand that creators need monetization. So, I&#39;m not against the 30sec-2min ads that you sometimes can skip. I&#39;m talking about when the creator says &quot;now before we go any further, I&#39;d like to talk about our amazing sponsor&quot;. The biggest example is for different VPN security companies.</p>\n\n<p>These days, there is alot more support for content creators getting actually paid for their work. That&#39;s great! And I definitely agree with it. But, I also don&#39;t think it should be such a priority that creators get to do this as their full time job. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the reason I think these are BS is that I pay for YouTube premium. Some people will make fun of me for that, but in my opinion it&#39;s worth the money to have zero ads, and to use the YouTube music app. But, these built-in ads basically circumvent that service. Not only is that just canniving, but it devalues YouTube Premium. I&#39;ve considered dropping it for this reason, and I&#39;m sure others have as well. </p>\n\n<p>That is why I think these ads are unethical. It just adds to the BS. A free user now has to watch BOTH types of ads, and I know what you&#39;re gonna say to that: &quot;if it&#39;s free you can&#39;t complain!&quot; Which is true, but if people spend 40% of their time on YouTube watching ads, they will migrate away from the platform. Therefore creators stand to make even less money, and the downward spiral goes from there.</p>\n\n<p>One last minor point, is that these videos will not age well at all. In 20-30 years, watching &quot;old&quot; YouTube videos will consist of watching a bunch of ads that promote bygone companies and products. You might say it&#39;ll be nostalgic, but I think it just takes away from the art. And yes I know that the opinion of viewers in 20 years has no bearing on the financial aspect of creation. That&#39;s why this point is minor. I still think it&#39;s valid for the sake of the art form though. What if the Mona Lisa had a banner across the bottom advertising &quot;Leo&#39;s Great Flying Machine now 15% off if you use the promo code CRAP&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: wording/clarifications</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: thanks to those who gave constructive and intelligent replies. It helped me make my view more defined and there were some good suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>To everyone else - thanks for convincing me that I&#39;m right!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
