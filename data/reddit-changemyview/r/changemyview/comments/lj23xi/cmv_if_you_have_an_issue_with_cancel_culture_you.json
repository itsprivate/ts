However, I find it highly hypocritical that many of the people who complain about cancel culture will then turn around and still defend an employer's freedom to fire their employees without cause in other circumstances.\n\nIn the US dismissal protection is extremely limited. Unless your employer accidentally gave away that they fired you for one of the few banned reasons (like being part of a racial minority) there is pretty much nothing they can't fire you for.\n\nNow, there are many arguments to be had about how prevalent or damaging cancel culture really is, and whether it actually deserves the word \"culture\", but the fact of the matter is that cancelling someone as most commonly discussed (i.e. firing them for a political statement that your employer didn't like) would actually be illegal in many other areas of the world.\n\nIn most first world countries employees can only fired with a specific cause. A firing might be due to economic reasons (downsizing or restructuring), due to injuries or other afflictions that make an employee unable to do their job, or because of undesirable behavior of the employee. \n\nHowever, even then there are restrictions on what can or can't be done. For example in Germany or the UK it would be illegal to fire someone for an arbitrary behavior not covered by the employment contract unless a) the employee was previously warned against this behavior and ignored the warning, or b) the behavior is illegal or highly unsafe towards their coworkers or clients etc.\n\nThat means in the classic case of a resurfacing mildly racist social media post from over 20 years ago the most an employer could probably do is warn you not to write something like that again, and even then that might not hold up in court depending on the nature of the post and your employment.\n\nPersonally I kind of prefer it that way. It gets rid of the somewhat arbitrary nature of \"being cancelled\" and means people can't just lose their livelihood from one day to the next because of something their employer disapproved of that they might not even have known would be an issue ahead of time. Yes, it does mean that sometimes people can post racist stuff on facebook and keep their job, but personally I think there are better ways of dealing with racists on the internet than by having their employer decide their punishment.\n\nHowever, if you are against cancel culture but still support companies being able to fire employees for other arbitrary reasons, then as far as I'm concerned you don't really care about fairness, you're just salty that your outdated political opinions are no longer considered acceptable in mainstream discourse.",
