I think the movement was misguided at best.\n\nOur entire dating culture is based around being coy, being indirect, assuming what others want and don't want, if we aren't going to address that first we aren't actually serious about confirmation-based sexual relationship. Here are a few examples of what I mean using James a slightly above average guy and Tara, a slightly above average woman, if 50/100 is the median James and tara are both 65/100,\n\nSituation A: Tara is sitting on a park table going through her phone, she's does so often, no big deal, James come up sits at her table across from her and strikes up a mild conversation with her, they've seen each other around but never spoken directly, after the basic introduction, day, weather, all that, he asks her out. Tara takes him up on it, because she is slightly interested, they meet up, go on date, it's nice no allusions to anything sexual on either end, go on a second date a couple of slightly of flirtatious moves, ends in a kiss, third date, ends in her apartment with them having sex. During that whole time, it's never explicitly stated they're going to have sex, one thing just kind of slowly leads to another, from the kiss on into PnV.\n\nSituation B: Tara is sitting on a park table going through her phone, she's does so often, no big deal, James come up sits at her table across from her and strikes up a mild conversation with her, they've seen each other around but never spoken directly, after the basic introduction day weather all that, he asks her if she might want to come by sometime and have sex, but with a decent amount of game. She responds \"classy, you really just ask random women if they want to fuck? No thanks.\" He responds \"fair enough, my bad\" gets up and leaves\n\nNow I'm sure plenty of women have dealt with situation A and B more than a few times, culturally we understand that situation B rarely plays out well, maybe 1/100000 times but Sitaution A? Plays out far more often probably 1/1000 (Numbers based on the amounts of request your average woman fields multiplied by how many women there are.)  But in that situation the less explicit approach is going to take you to the bedroom far more often than the very explicit straightforward request.\n\nHopefully, it's clear how problematic that is for the cultural movement at large. You can't reasonably expect an explicit culture to evolve when the explicit path rarely works and is actively being pushed away by that same movement of people (the same group would generally be anti-catcallers but for all their crassness catcalling is being honest about their intentions).\n\nI'm in support of waiting for a no personally for a few different reasons.\n\nA. It's safer, women are able to verify the men over a few different instances and create trust.\n\nB. It's more civil, just from a worldwide perspective, courting is what we do to cover a generally crass act. The higher the courting standards generally the more polite the society.\n\nC. Yes means yes is rather clunky, and that's coming from someone who has ALWAYS used the method as much as possible. (Since 18 I've always asked before kissing, and used the phrase \"let me know if this makes you uncomfortable\" before I start shooting for second base, hasn't failed me yet, but I also think I'm an unfair standard to hold every guy to and that was also after all the coy traditional dating stuff)\n\nTLDR: \"Yes means yes\" can't overtake \"no means no\" when culturally being straightforward and asking for a yes isn't selected for, but playing coy and waiting for a no is rewarded and more functional for both parties. Basically, unless we're going to push women to start accepting random requests for sex more often \"yes means yes\" is just a pipedream\n\nEDIT: To clarify, in both situations James key goal is sex, not a relationship, Situation A is an example of the implicit method, Situation B is an example of the explicit method.",
