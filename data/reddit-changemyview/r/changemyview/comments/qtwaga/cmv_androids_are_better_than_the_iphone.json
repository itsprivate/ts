It wasn’t until about 6 months ago when I got my first android that I first caught a glimpse that I was completely wrong. The Android cellular device is such a great phone. I used to think that because androids didn’t have iMessage or FaceTime, that the phones were wack. Little did I know, a phone is way more than just these two things. For instance, Androids provide a better battery life overall, consists of more features within the phone itself, etc. I think it’s important to not get caught up in the trend all the time. Your look on Androids could be the opposite of the actual experience once you get your hands on one. My view is that overall, I think Androids are the better phone in comparison to the iPhone. Not by popularity, but by simply the phone itself. Let me know anything that you feel could change my view, open to all takes</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
