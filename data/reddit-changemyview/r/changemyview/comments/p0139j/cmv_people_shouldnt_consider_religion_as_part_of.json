Isn&#39;t that a bit like considering being a humanist part of your identity? To my knowledge, nobody does that, but with religion it&#39;s considered normal. Why? Why become so emotionally attached to a bunch of claims that you consider it to be a &quot;fundamental part of them&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, I am religious, so don&#39;t view this as me having a bash at other religious people. I perform rituals daily, wear religious jewellery, attend temple weekly, celebrate festivals etc, but I would NEVER consider it to be part of my identity. It&#39;s just part of my routine, like eating breakfast is. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Can someone please change my view so I can see how considering religion to be a part of someone&#39;s identity is not absurd? Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
