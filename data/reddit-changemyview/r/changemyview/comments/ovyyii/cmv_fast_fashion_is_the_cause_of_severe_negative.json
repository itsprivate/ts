The fashion industry as a whole creates 80 billion garments a year which is over 10 for each person on earth. The production 20 years ago has now increased by over 400%. Also with the recent production methods, there is an average of 10 times a garment is worn before it is thrown away. Since the prices of these products are decreasing, and fashion trends are accelerating, the quality of production is minimal. Majority of the time, these clothes are either disposed of through incineration or go to the landfill if they are not recycled or donated. The environmental issues that arise with these methods lead to water usage, microfibers, greenhouse gases, deforestation, toxins and even human rights issues.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
