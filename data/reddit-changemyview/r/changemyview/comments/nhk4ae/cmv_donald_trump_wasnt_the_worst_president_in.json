They are power-obsessed individuals who have committed some of the most horrible crimes in history, including mass murder. *As a US president,* Trump was utterly mediocre. At least he didn’t start another war, which in my eyes already puts him above several post-WWII presidents. Obama was better, but Obama was clearly an above-average president. Trump was below average, but calling him the worst of all time when even recent history includes war criminals like Bush reeks of media sensationalism, and is frankly insulting to the hundreds of millions of people around the world whose entire existence has been haunted by what some of Trump’s predecessors have done. *Change my view!*",
