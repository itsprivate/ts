My answer is: why should I care about the Internet if I don&#39;t have a job and if I can even find one it&#39;s paid pennies, if I don&#39;t have sincere relationships and suffer from loneliness, if within 30 years I risk ending like KFC chicken because of some rich fossil fuel addicted dudes?</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m saying is that older generations shouldn&#39;t make up lies to make us feel like we&#39;re the luckiest generation in the world and just admit that they lived better and we (Gen Z) are completely fucked.</p>\n\n<p>CMV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
