These chickens are not kept specifically for this purpose, but we take the eggs that they do not fertilize/that the hens don’t take to. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that one moral criticism of eating eggs is the conditions that hens are kept in for commercial egg laying/packaging operations. I also understand that there is culling of male chicks in the industry. My argument is that what I am doing is not morally wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Assumptions that my argument rests on:\n-“Cruelty free,” means that the person eating the eggs knows with certainty that no chicken was harmed in order to procure the egg. \n-The egg is not a living creature. This probably goes without saying, but an unfertilized gamete generally doesn’t get the same moral consideration as a living being.</p>\n\n<p>Change my view, please!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
