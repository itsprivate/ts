  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Shower thought are known to be these weird or interesting thoughts, that you could only think about about in the shower. My friends were talking about this, and there was a consensus between them that their best thoughts come to them in the shower. There&#39;s even a subreddit for these interesting thoughts and revelations that people had while in the shower.</p>\n\n<p>This lead me to think about what makes the shower so unique compared to the rest of daily life, and what about the shower allows for thoughts to flow freely. From what my friends&#39; said, the shower is a time where they can just think and do nothing else, so it gives them the place to have thoughts that are more interesting than daily life things.</p>\n\n<p>This makes sense to me, but if this is the reason for shower thoughts, it also implies that people don&#39;t take the time to think about things outside the shower. Not only that, but people have to shower, so the reason to set this time aside to think about stuff is because you have to in order to be clean. Meaning that just thinking about things is not the first priority while taking a shower and it&#39;s only a byproduct of needing to stay clean.</p>\n\n<p>So since we&#39;ve established that the source for shower thoughts is the fact that the shower is a place where you can just think about whatever, I think this means that if you only have interesting thoughts in the shower, that you&#39;re not taking the time to just think about stuff. Same goes for interesting thoughts before you fall asleep - if that is the only time you can think freely, you&#39;re not investing any time in allowing yourself to think.</p>\n\n<p>I think thinking is so important, and it&#39;s numbing to think only about daily life during the day. If I don&#39;t have enough time to think during the day I have a hard time falling asleep, since that&#39;s the only other time I have if I can&#39;t find the time during the day. How are you supposed to lead your life if the only time you get to think is your 15 minute shower?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
