Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, all of these were failed wars. People in charge knew they were &amp; didn&#39;t want to end them for various political reasons. We can see how bad the optics of this pullout were for Biden, it&#39;s easier to just keep it going for your term than to face the political consequences of admitting defeat. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t necessarily blame soldiers in Vietnam for taking part in that war even though it was an atrocity in general because there was a draft at the time. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>For Iraq &amp; Afghanistan I was alive during 9/11 and I remember pretty clearly the fervor that swept through the nation and I understand how young men and women were swept up in that &amp; trusted the government enough to put their lives on the line. People signed up and fought and died thinking that the people in charge had a coherent plan and that this was going to serve some greater good in the end, to an extent, especially during the early stages of the war I understand that. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>However going forward I think there&#39;s a clear enough track record that whatever the next war we start happens to be the default line of thought for the public should be to not trust the government and military on it and to not sign up to be maimed or killed in support of it. I think they have proven themselves not credible over a long period of time. At this point anyone who enlists to fight and thinks that they are a hero or are defending freedom or the United States or any of the other talking points that they military uses is being delusional. If someone wants to enlist because they need the job or the benefits or good or even if they just straight up want to have some military adventurism and go to war regardless that&#39;s rational I think, but anyone who is still buying the official narrative on military service at this point I think is being foolish. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: The US government / military has lost credibility. Anyone who signs up to fight the next war &amp; thinks they doing something noble and heroic is delusional</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
