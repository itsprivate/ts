What I&#39;m asking is implementation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-fine\">Day fines</a> on every fine. This is already happening in some nations especially for speeding tickets and I see no reason not to expand it to everything.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Since I can&#39;t keep giving out deltas for the same argument. I admit there might need a minimum amount of a fine.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The idea of choosing between a fine and community service has been brought up. I like that suggestion very much since it&#39;s an option for those too poor to lose even a percentage of their monthly salary.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
