  "selftext": "I was recently reading a BBC opinion article that identified a list of new terms for various descriptors on the spectrum of asexuality. These included: asexual, ace, demisexual, aromantic, gray-sexual, heteroromantic, homoromantic and allosexual. This brought some deeper thoughts to the surface, which I'd like to externalise and clarify.\n\nI've never been a fan of assigning labels to people. Although two people are homosexual, it doesn't mean they have identical preferences. So why would we label them as the primary action, and look at their individual preferences as the secondary action?\n\nI've always aimed to be competent in dealing with grey areas, making case-specific judgements and finding out information relevant to the current situation. In my view, we shouldn't be over-simplifying reality by assigning labels, which infers a broad stereotype onto an individual who may only meet a few of the stereotypical behaviours. \n\nI understand the need for labels to exist - to make our complex world accessible and understandable. However, I believe this should be an external projection to observe how others around us function. It's useful to manage risks (e.g. judge the risk of being mugged by an old lady versus young man) and useful for statistical analysis where detailed sub-questioning isn't practical.\n\nI've more and more often seen variants of the phrase *'I discovered that I identified as XXX and felt so much better'* in social media and publications (such as this BBC article). The article is highlighting this in a positive, heart-warming/bravery frame. \n\nThis phrase makes me uneasy, as it feels like an extremely unhealthy way of perceiving the self. As if they weren't real people until they felt they could be simplified because they're not introspective enough to understand their own preferences. As if engaging with reality is less justified than engaging with stereotypical behaviour. As if the preferences weren't obvious until it had an arbitrary label assigned - and they then became suddenly clear. And they are relatively arbitrary - with no clear threshold between the categories we've used to sub-divide what is actually a spectrum. To me, life-changing relief after identifying with a label demonstrates an unhealthy coping mechanism for not dealing with deeper problems, not developing self-esteem, inability to navigate grey areas and not having insight into your own thoughts. Ultimately, inability to face reality.\n\nAs you can see, I haven't concisely pinned down exactly *why* I have a problem with this new culture of 'proclaiming your label with pride'. In some sense, I feel people are projecting their own inability to cope with reality onto others, and I dislike the trend towards participating in this pseudo-reality. Regardless, I would like to hear your arguments against this perspective.\n\n---\n\n\n**EDIT: Thanks to those who have 'auto-replied' on my behalf when someone hasn't seen the purpose of my argument. I won't edit the original post because it will take comments below out of context, but I will clarify...**\n\n**My actual argument was that people shouldn't be encouraged to seek life-changing significance, pride or self-confidence from 'identifying' themselves. The *internal* labelling is my concern, as it encourages people to detach from their individual grey-areas within the spectrum of preferences to awkwardly fit themselves into the closest stereotype - rather than simply developing coping strategies for addressing reality directly, i.e. self-esteem, mental health, insight.**",
