Having said that, I feel that my argument is primarily predicated upon my belief that treating pedophilia as a mental illness will lead to a decrease in the number of those crimes.</p>\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, both the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases, respectively) classify pedophilia as a mental disorder, pedophilic disorder. Again, take this for what it’s worth to you.</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s very telling that if you look into the correlation between therapy and the rates of suicide and suicidal ideation, therapy causes as substantial decrease in both of those activities, as you would expect. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389707/\">2019 meta analysis of the subject</a> found “Out of 1578 papers, 40 original observational studies fulfilled our selection criteria. The most used psychotherapeutic treatments were dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT, 27.5%) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, 15.0%) in patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (32.5%) and depression (15.0%). Despite the between-study heterogeneity, interventions lead to a <strong>reduction in suicidal outcomes, i.e., suicidal ideation (55.0%) and suicide attempts (37.5%).</strong> The content and reporting quality varied considerably between the studies.”</p>\n\n<p>The worst thing that you can do in regards to untenable behavior, be it suicide, homocide or child abuse, is to make it so those with thoughts of doing those things are unable to express those thoughts. If we treat pedophiles - again, not sex offenders - with sympathy and understanding, then their path to rehabilitation becomes much more clear. Pedophiles are never going to wake up one day and stop being pedophiles. Expecting that of pedophiles is just as reasonable as expecting it from an LGBTQ person. Not to say that being a pedophile is comparable to being gay, bi or trans on a moral level, but they are similar in the sense that the feeling is never going to disappear.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, despite what I have said, there isn’t really a known “cure” for pedophilia. The therapy I have been alluding to only works to decrease instances of pedophiles acting on their feelings, there has been no evidence that a sexual preference for children can be altered - at least not consistently. I would argue this all the more reason to support people with these feelings. If you’ll indulge an appeal to emotion, imagine being in their position. These are individuals who are unable to act out one of the most natural human urges, sex. Additionally, and I don’t have evidence for this but I don’t think it’s a stretch, a great number of them very likely feel disgusted with themselves for these feelings. And then, imagine not being able to express the position that you are in without being totally ostracized. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we totally remove the well-being pedophiles themselves out of this, don’t you think that’s a social climate that breeds more cases of children being assaulted, rather than less?</p>\n\n<p>Pedophiles have an urge that should not be acted upon under any circumstance. To me, this is precisely why they require support. If not for their own benefit, then to the benefit of the people who could be their victims. </p>\n\n<p>I want to close this out by clarify not everyone who sexual assaults children is a pedophile, just as not all pedophiles assault children. There’s definitely some overlap, but I’m not going to act as though reaching a hand out to pedophiles would eliminate this type of assault.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
