Also don&#39;t get me started on the body dysmorphia.\nAlso reaserch show that seeing your friends always posting their best self on social media and comparing yourself to them makes u depressed and unsatisfied with your life, and no, the &quot;remember social media is fake&quot; trend is like pissing into a fire  trying to estinguish it, it does t solve the problem. \nthe only thing they&#39;re good is to keep in touch with poeple but the posting part is totally useless and it&#39;s just a way to get validation for a generation that is willing to do the dumbest shit to get it. \nAlso tik tok should be canceled. It is basically a p*do/horny guys/creeps dream come true where they can see underage girls dressing and acting in revealing &quot;clothes &quot;  desperate for likes but they don&#39;t know where they come from. Also it is a Chinese company that doesn&#39;t give a shut about your privacy just saying... \nThey are also the worst source to get information from cause 90 percent of the time reaserch and statistics is manipulated or not cited(like this post lol) and fake news are spread like crazy \nHope someone will change my point of view since I have the sin to still using them daily and I need to feel good about myself even tho we all know  these things.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
