Its something that sparks a mild existential crisis pretty much every time I think about it. I tend to vacillate back and forth between the two viewpoints but I feel like believing things DO happen for a reason is just a comforting defense mechanism.\n\nI think opinions on this matter are all totally subjective, and based almost entirely on each person's life experience. Not to be condescending but with the exception of religious reasons, I think optimistic folks are only that way because they haven't endured the level of trauma or loss or suffering people like myself have. I am incredibly jaded, nihilistic, cynical, detached, desensitized, etc. so its impossible for me to look at what goes on in the world and think there's some grand design or master plan or metaphysical force at work. Even just in my own life terrible things have consistently happened since birth and I've always been a good human being.\n\nSo, I'd like to discuss this in as practical a way as possible. Why do you believe things happen for a reason? And be specific. What theories do you have that support things happening for a reason EVEN IF you don't believe it? What evidence is there that life isn't random chaos?\n\nPlease feel free to get as philosophical/scientific as you want. As long as you explain how/why it supports your belief with specifics. I know this will bring us into territory like free will, physics, determinism, etc. but keep it related to changing my view if you can! I urge you to share your opinion on the stereotypical problems in this discussion like cancer, brain aneurysms, innocent children dying, etc. Sorry to be dark but this is an innately dark topic.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**CLARIFICATION EDIT:** Some are getting caught up on the semantics of what I mean by \"things\" so let me be clear. I'm referring to negative events outside our control like natural disasters, innocent people dying in shootings/accidents, cancer, stuff like that. Bad things happening to people randomly, especially really good people. And as for the reason part I don't mean literally the scientific quantifiable reason. \"An electrical imbalance in these storm clouds caused a discharge resulting in lightning striking and killing this person\". No. I mean a reason as in this person deserved it/ it was meant to happen/ it was part of some plan/ it was karma, and so on. I'm refuting the widely used phrase \"everything happens for a reason\" and everyone knows what that implies so come on people.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**EDIT 2:** I'm trying my best to address everyone! I will eventually get to you. Honestly I expected to be downvoted away but I greatly appreciate everybody's input and contributions.",
