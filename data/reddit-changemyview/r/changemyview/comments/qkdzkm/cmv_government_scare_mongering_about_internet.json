  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So in the UK after the recent murder of an MP (the second in 5 years) the government is now considering removing anonymity in the UK for social media platforms. This is the same government that also tried to make you require ID to view porn and that has made it illegal to cause a disruption while protesting. Its important to note that anonymous internet use has nothing to do with the murder. They keep saying that anonymous users are increasing hate but that&#39;s not true. most hate online is produced by people who have established fan bases and audiences. just 12 people are responsible for most of the covid conspiracy theories, those 12 people were not anonymous. Most hate on social media is also not anonymous and even when it is it doesn&#39;t matter 99% of the time. When thousands of people are telling someone to kill themselves why does it matter if they are anonymous or not? Even if someone does go through and put in the effort to report all of the messages and then if the social media website does deal with every single report and then what? They will either get punished in the way they would do already via getting temp banned or muted or their account deleted or they would get some real world punishment like what? This whole plan to remove internet anonymity has no end game just like every other plan the old morons in government have about the internet. They just want more power regardless if they can control that power, regardless of if they can even use that power, regardless of if they even understand that power they just want to hold power over their citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Theres a reason why most terrorists are already suspected terrorists and yet still commit an attack successfully its because the government isn&#39;t even funding these departments that they give all this power to. After the last MP murder they passed a law to increase security for MPs.... but then never actually did anything for it and it was obviously worthless as another MP has been killed easily without any issue. </p>\n\n<p>Not to mention of course all the celebrities who are famous for harassing people who despite not being anonymous still harass people. Look at the rags who basically stalk the royal family and celebrities, they cause more harassment than any online trolls. </p>\n\n<p>The internet needs to be anonymous to stop bastards like the government from silencing all speech against themselves which this government obviously wants to do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
