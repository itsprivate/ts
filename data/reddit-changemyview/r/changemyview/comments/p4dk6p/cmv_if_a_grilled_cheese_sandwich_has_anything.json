Cheese cannot be an after thought or an accent in something something called &quot;grilled cheese sandwich&quot;  anything other than primary cheese bread and butter/mayo/oil is a sandwich with cheese or some kind of melt.  Help me understand this absolute insanity.   </p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty light hearted CMV and is inspired by the fact that I keep seeing these giant meat filled sandwiches with cheese on them being called things like &quot;brisket grilled cheese sandwich&quot;  and to me that is a sandwich yes but it shouldn&#39;t be called a grilled cheese. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m the crazy one but a half pound or pound of meat on bread is just a sandwich even if it has cheese on it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have been informed that apparently restaurants and trendy internet people love to toss around the term &quot;grilled  cheese&quot;  its apparently seen as a fad or a fancy item now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
