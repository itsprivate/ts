The point of the debate was to truly change a persons mind, but it has now devolved into near physical altercation because two sides can’t agree to let the other side finish their sentences.</p>\n\n<p>This scene of debates goes back as old as ancient Greece all the way to modern democratic parliaments. Humans are simply too emotional to put them aside for the sake of truth seeking. Angers rise when words can no longer be found.</p>\n\n<p>[Edit]: Thanks guys. What I like about this thread is that it both proved and disproved my argument. I learned a lot via online opinions but I also learned that online makes debates very disjointed and lose interest.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
