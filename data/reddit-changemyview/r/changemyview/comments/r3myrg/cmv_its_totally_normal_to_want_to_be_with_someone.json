I have friends because we share specific hobbies or have known each other since we were kids. Romantic relationships are a different thing. I&#39;ve had women say they just want to be friends and I just politely said &quot;that&#39;s ok I&#39;m just looking for a romantic partner right now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s weird that people feel that friendship is the foundation and you build romance on top of that. Of course I&#39;m friends with my wife, but if we weren&#39;t together then I probably wouldn&#39;t be. </p>\n\n<p>Consider this: if you have a young child, would you spend time with them if they weren&#39;t your child? I&#39;m not saying you wouldn&#39;t enjoy spending time with kids if they aren&#39;t yours, but would you specifically set up time to hang out them? </p>\n\n<p>Do you have friends the same age as your parents? Or do you only have that relationship with them <em>because</em> they are your parents? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not an insult to not be friends with someone. I&#39;m not friends with a lot of people I would probably enjoy spending time with. The reality is I just have a few spaces in my life for important people. I wouldn&#39;t go around treating kids like my own child just like I wouldn&#39;t go around talking about my feelings with women who aren&#39;t my wife. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying men and women can&#39;t be friends. That&#39;s not the claim. I&#39;m saying friends and other catagories aren&#39;t the same. I don&#39;t look for the same thing from friends that I do from a parent or a spouse.</p>\n\n<p>Now obviously, there&#39;s nothing wrong with seeing someone as just a friend. But you can&#39;t decide they have to see you the same way and not leave when they find out you don&#39;t like them. </p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m interested in someone sexually and they aren&#39;t into me. I don&#39;t want to see them anymore. I&#39;m not angry about it, but if someone specifically tells me I&#39;m not what they want, why would I want to spend time with them? If we were already friends for a while sure, but if it&#39;s always been a romantic potential for me then no romance = I&#39;m out. </p>\n\n<p>We only have so much time for each person in our lives. As well as work and self care, meditation, hobbies, etc. If you don&#39;t want to be in the one catagory I&#39;m hiring for, then there&#39;s no open positions at this time. And honestly it should go vice versa. Why you would want to be friends with someone who wants to date you is beyond me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
