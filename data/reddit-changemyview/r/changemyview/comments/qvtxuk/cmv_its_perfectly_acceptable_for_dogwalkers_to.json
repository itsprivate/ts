Dog-owners/walkers should be responsible and pick up after their dogs, but it shouldn’t be an issue for them to throw a poop bag into the first trash can they see.</p>\n\n<p>My reasoning is along the lines of we’d all (probably) rather it get thrown away in our bin than left in our yard, and a bin that’s on the street/near the sidewalk is easily accessible and open to this kind of thing. If it’s on the street, this is perfectly legal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Interested in hearing others’ thoughts why a dog owner/walker should carry a used poop bag for the duration of their walk and throw it in their own bin.</p>\n\n<p>Just to preemptively address the main point I expect to hear regarding responsibility: I view picking it up and throwing it in any bin as taking responsibility for your dog’s shit. By doing so, even in someone else’s bin, you’re eliminating the need for someone else to clean it up.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
