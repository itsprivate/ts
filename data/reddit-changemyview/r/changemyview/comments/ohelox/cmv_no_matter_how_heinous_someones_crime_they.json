We say phrases like, &quot;you can just tell he did it,&quot; and &quot;if he had nothing to hide...,&quot; among others.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this is more controversial, but many have argued there is racial, gender, cultural, etc. bias in terms of convictions and sentencing, and there is evidence to suggest this.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if you were wrongly convicted of a crime you did not commit. How would you wish to be treated?</p>\n\n<p>While we may need to remove violent criminals from society based on their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it doesn&#39;t seem right to me to condemn that person to a horrible existence once removed from society.</p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong about this? Are the relatively small number of overturned convictions evidence that our justice system gets it right enough that it doesn&#39;t matter? Do the ends justify the means?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m very curious to know everyone&#39;s thoughts, as I&#39;m very open to others&#39; opinions on this view, and I&#39;m very open to changing view if the logic is sound.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
