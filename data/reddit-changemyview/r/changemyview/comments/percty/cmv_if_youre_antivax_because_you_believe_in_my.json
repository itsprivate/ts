I think that if you believe in that statement as an argument for being anti-vaccination that you have to also be pro-choice. There seems to be a large overlap of people who are anti-vax and evangelical (anti-abortion), which got me thinking...</p>\n\n<p>The only argument I&#39;ve been able to come up with being against this line of thinking is that abortion effects a 3rd party (the fetus) where as a vaccination only effects the host. My argument would be that when you choose to not get vaccinated you&#39;re choice doesn&#39;t just effect you. Your choice has the potential to effect countless other people around you including death. If you infect someone with something you&#39;re carrying and they die because of it I&#39;d argue that you caused the death of that person. Sure you could argue it&#39;s not a one-to-one thing and there&#39;s a chance that you might not infect anyone, but ultimately it&#39;s a choice you&#39;re making that has the potential to effect a lot of people who didn&#39;t have a choice in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>So, yeah, I don&#39;t really see how you can be anti-vax and not also pro-choice.
