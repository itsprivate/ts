If the original creator of something is no longer selling it, this giving me no way to support them, I shouldn&#39;t feel bad at all for pirating it. As an example, there is a large multitude of Nintendo games that simply aren&#39;t available for sale anymore. Hell, the game Mother 3 was never even released outside of Japan with NO way for me to play it OTHER than pirating it and emulation. I will always buy an official copy of something to support the artists behind it, but if I can&#39;t do that, I will gladly pirate something instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
