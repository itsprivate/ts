They are citing freedom of speech, blah blah blah.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that he went on a rant that was, at best, extremely bigoted against an oppressed group (since these sites seem to have a problem with the word homophobic), and blatantly not factual (his comments about AIDS) and they are ok with that says a lot.  His rant was public, very pointed, and done at a music festival.  This isn&#39;t like he just said &quot;f-g&quot; while in conversation.  It was a lot worse.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to Morgan Wallen, the white country guy, who basically said the n word while out with friends and was just caught on a neighbors security camera.  People were up in arms about him.  And think he deserved getting basically dropped from his label.  </p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not a fan of either of these people. I like rap, so I know Da Baby a bit more, but his music isn&#39;t my taste.  And I don&#39;t like country.  But the fact that these accounts and people can be so vocal about defending this guys bigotry is just absurd.  I understand you may care more about anti black bigotry, but we can&#39;t just act like other forms of bigotry is ok.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
