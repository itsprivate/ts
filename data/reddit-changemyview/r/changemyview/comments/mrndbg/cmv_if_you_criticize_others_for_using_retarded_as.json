  "selftext": "> A quick preface: I believe it's wrong and irrational to direct anger at a perceived lack of intelligence, real or otherwise. If you're someone who uses this word as a slur, please read this post carefully and understand that I do not advocate your behavior. I'm glad you get called out on it. I just wish the people calling you out would do a better job. I love people of all IQ levels, and weaponizing disabilities as pejoratives is unenlightened character. \n\nI used to think it was funny and edgy to call people \"retards\" because it seemed like there was no reason not to. I've since argued myself away from this position, but what bothers me is that my reasoning is entirely independent of every criticism I've ever received for that behavior, and it's not even a very difficult argument. This makes me feel like most people who decry these types of slurs don't actually understand the philosophy of it, and they're just repeating what they've been told is a safe opinion. \n\nWhen criticized, I would always ask in defense of my ableism, \"don't you yourself use words like 'idiot,' 'moron,' or 'stupid' to insult people?\" and invariably, my detractors would answer yes. This ends the debate. If you're regularly expressing a sense of superiority over people with lower IQ or lower intelligence, then you don't get to police the language others use to express the same exact idea. It's hypocritical and annoying. \n\nNow, if you're using this language accidentally and wouldn't defend yourself on it, then that's different and understandable. These words are so deeply embedded into our culture and conditioned into our vernacular that it can be genuinely difficult not to make this mistake sometimes. You might even be able to find me doing it in my post history. The difference is that I wouldn't say it's okay, and that I'm working on it. \n\nEveryone I've ever debated on this, however, has claimed that it's okay to call people idiots or morons, but not retards. That it's okay to say something is stupid or dumb, but not retarded. \n\nTheir claim tends to be that weaponizing a medical diagnosis as an insult is meaningfully distinct from using terms like \"moron\" or \"imbecile,\" and this usually sparks a lengthy discussion about how these terms were once themselves medical diagnoses. I'm going to skip over that for the sake of brevity in my OP, but I'm happy to elaborate if anyone asks. \n\nEven for terms that were never diagnoses, you're expressing the same sentiment. You're revealing the same attitude about low intelligence as everyone who uses \"the R word,\" but you're using language that helps you cower away from taking responsibility for that attitude. \n\nIf you really care about changing others' minds on this issue, you'd make THIS argument instead (I think it would have immediately swayed me years ago): \n\n1.) Intelligence, as far as we can tell, is a largely immutable trait.\n\n2.) I believe it's wrong to attack others for immutable traits (race, sex, height, crystallized intelligence, or any other physical characteristic). \n\n3.) Just because ableism is generally accepted and encouraged doesn't mean I get to participate in that culture if I truly believe it's wrong to attack others for immutable traits. \n\n4.) I should stop placing negative value on low intelligence. This means quitting \"the R word,\" and it also means quitting the idea behind that word, so no more \"idiots,\" \"dumbasses,\" or \"stupid fucks\" either. If I have a gripe with someone or something, I'll have to describe it in more accurate and responsible terms. \n\nCMV\n\nEDIT: I'm taking a break from this thread for a bit. I want to get to all of you eventually, but I wasn't expecting this many replies.",
