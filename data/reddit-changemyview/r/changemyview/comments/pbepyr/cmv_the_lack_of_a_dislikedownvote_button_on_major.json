As Reddit has shown us over the past decade+, content which receives far more upvotes than downvotes moves up in the algorithm&#39;s ranking and is more likely to be seen. Additionally, from a psychosocial standpoint, humans <em>want</em> to be viewed as agreeable, and tend towards views and behavior that the masses consider good. On reddit this often leads to a positive feedback loop, where highly-upvoted content receives even more upvotes because, well, it&#39;s already been upvoted.</p>\n\n<p>Since the aforementioned platforms only have positive reactions for posts and comments (outside of Facebook which has angry/laugh reactions) there&#39;s no true way for a person to tell the relative popularity of a person&#39;s post. This means content that only a small minority of people agree with can end up looking very popular.</p>\n\n<p>This leads me to my opinion that beliefs which are truly on the fringe, or at least used to be - such as anti-vaccine or anti-mask - appear more socially acceptable than they really are, and leads people down that path.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I&#39;m not saying:</strong> The content ranking algorithm on platforms which feature a downvote button, such as Reddit, are &quot;ideal&quot;. I&#39;m only stating my view in the context of enabling and unintentionally promoting false information surrounding vaccines, specifically the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
