When you have a category, in this instance “gender”, it must contain some things and exclude others for it to be a category. If it can be molded to be anything you want, than it’s not a category anymore and is just a word that could fit into anything. When you have catgender or gamergender or sleepgender or whatever, these don’t actually reflect our understanding of gender, because they can literally be whatever you want them to be and are created by the minute. The reason trans people are just as valid as cis people is because there is a medical understanding and validity attached to their existence. These xenogenders are basically just nicknames, considering they are unique to the individual. They are representations of their hobbies and interests rather than any kind of deep connection to their roles in society, physical form, or any other of the important tenants of gender. Arguments saying “xenogenders aren’t very mainstream or widespread” are silly. Obviously they are a very small percent of the online scene, but that doesn’t mean their ideas are any more valid or deserve any kind of recognition. </p>\n\n<p>I would love to see any counter arguments, though I’m fairly confident in this position.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
