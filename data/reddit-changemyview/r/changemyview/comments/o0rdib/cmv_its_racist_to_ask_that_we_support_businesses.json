I don't mean to be disrespectful in any way. \n\nIf this is relevant to my stance in any way, I belong to a minority. \n\nWhen someone asks that people support a business, simply because that business is owned by someone of a certain race, they're doing a number of things:\n\n1. Active acknowledgment that the owner belongs to a certain race. This within itself is not necessarily racist (depending on how narrow the definition of \"racism\" is), but the distinction has been made. They are singling out certain businesses. \n\n2. There is a suggestion being made that these businesses aren't doing as well because they are owned by people of a certain race. Am I wrong if I think this suggestion within itself is a form of racist stereotyping, unless it's coupled with cited evidence of some form of economical analysis/statistical measure? \n\n3. The preference to support certain businesses over other businesses simply because of the owner's race is inherently a choice made based on race, and is therefore racist. (For instance, if you choose to support a minority business instead of a white-owned business because of the minority factor, that can be construed as racist. And vice versa would be true as well.)\n\nI always thought of racism as special treatment or consideration (either positive or negative) of one particular race over another. Is there a definition that fits better which would explain the thinking behind supporting businesses because they are owned by a specific race as a move away from racism?\n\nEdit:\nThe majority of responses I have received touch upon 3 main points. I will generally respond to them here.\n\n \"Being colourblind is not the answer to racism\"\n\nThere is a generous amount of research which suggests that it is literally impossible to escape implicit racial bias. Psychologically speaking the human brain subconsciously registers differences. For those of you speaking about the importance of diversity, I don't disagree, but I will remind everyone that I am cautious to make this the centre of our discussion because I do not feel that race and culture are not the same thing, although they may be related and/or synonymous. \n\n\"It's a form of counterbalancing which we accept as a desirable and effective measure against racism\"\n\nI'm reluctant to give in to this argument because I think it's sticky. \n\nIt's obviously not the exact same thing, but it's remniscient of the discussions we have had in the past about the appropriateness of paying reparations to African Americans on the basis of the fact that some of their ancestors being slaves in the past may have set them back generationally in terms of success. \n\nWhilst I don't deny that the cycle of poverty is real, it seems racially (or generally, idk) insensitive to say we can balance stuff out simply by doing x.  Such behaviour comes with good intentions but it attempts to quantify the magnitude of other people's suffering, which is problematic. \n\nIt begets two further questions:\n\nFirstly: is it not racist to continually single the descendants of certain races out, and tell them that they aren't doing as well because of their ancestors' past? Even if statistically this is true for a significant proportion of that population, applying the statement as a universal truth to all minority businesses seems like racial stereotyping to me. \n\nSecond: when, if ever, can we say we've done enough to right the wrong? Who are we to decide? Is it racist to think we can? \n\n\"This is related to the support small/local businesses movement\"\n\nA follow-up question: Okay, why don't we just say that? Why do we have to explicitly mention race?\n\nAnd also: does that mean the statement \"support minority businesses\" is really only about small/local minority-owned businesses? If a minority-owned business isn't small or local then are they not topical?",
