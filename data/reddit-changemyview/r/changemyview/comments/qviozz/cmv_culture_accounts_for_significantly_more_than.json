The most obvious example being the wealth disparities among different groups of people. Non-white populations all have significantly lower median household incomes. Of course racism and colonialism are relevant factors, but nigerians and asians face identical obstacles yet earn <em>significantly more</em> than white people do. Does anyone really believe it&#39;s simply a coincidence that one group&#39;s culture emphasizes education to an extreme degree while the other&#39;s glorifies sports, music, etc? I feel the reality is obvious. I know nigerian/asian immigrants who came to the US with literally nothing and within two generations their family holds tremendous wealth. Their children weren&#39;t focusing on being athletes or rappers, they instead they worked to become doctors. </p>\n\n<p>Of course I acknowledge systemic inequalities exist. The US is now famous for that. But I don&#39;t see how anyone can argue culture doesn&#39;t explain a <em>lot</em> of what we see in the world. From incarceration rates to education to wealth or health.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
