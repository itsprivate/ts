But yet, what is and what's not cultural appropriation is very much cherry picked despite the definition applying to a lot of things that would not colloquially be considered cultural appropriation, and the cherry picking tends to have a biased pattern where the majority group tends to almost always get the backlash, whereas the minority group doing the same actions almost never get such outrage.  \n\nWhite Americans are accused of appropriation despite American minority groups not being better at *not* appropriating, if not sometimes worse. Black Americans—specifically non Muslim ones—are not criticised for adopting Arabic(-esque) names, the butchering of French orthography in the creation of many of their names, or ones from West African cultures where they do not belong to. In addition to that, many other instances such as wearing clothing from African countries they don’t belong to, or even tribal marks which can be offensive when used inappropriately as has been done. Furthermore and more infamously, the appropriation of claiming ownership of certain hairstyles like dreadlocks despite it being present in older civilisations, in addition to the very fact that...everyone’s hair will develop some sort of lock one way or another if it’s not combed. There are examples of other minorities doing the same thing as well, such as Korean-Americans accusing white chefs of appropriation for cooking Korean food, but lack the self awareness to see the massive amounts of cultural appropriation in their own cuisine, such as Korean’s putting corn, sweet potato, and whatever other ingredients that is not used in Italy. As we can see in these sets of examples, there’s a large lack of actual care about cultural respect from these communities and it further taints the authenticity of accusations of cultural appropriation, and further showcases how the accusations tend to simply be used as a device to express one’s racism and an attempt to police what someone can and can’t do.\n\nThe popular assumption for the dreadlocks scenario—that if a black person is to wear dreadlocks, they would get discriminated against whereas a white person wouldn’t—works under assumption rather than reality. Dreadlocks on anyone is not professional, and no white person with dreadlocks is capable of entering the work force anymore easily as a black person with them on, making the comparisons of black people not being allowed to wear them in work environments and comparing them to white people irrelevant, particularly when there aren’t any white people wearing dreadlocks in the workforce to compare (if anything, that showcases the point). The discrimination of black people wearing those hairstyles is more apparent because...they wear those hairstyles more than other groups, and the issue is less about who wears it, and more about the hairstyles in general, and that should be the focus of the issue. In casual environments, the accusations of cultural appropriation of “white” celebrities wearing dreadlocks, braids, or whatever and that they get praised whereas black people get shamed for it is another folly example considering...they’re celebrities, kind of a no brainer they’re going to get a significant amount of praise, but there is an apparent lack of this shaming black people are supposed to get when black celebrities wear such hairstyles to events and get praised as well.  \n\nThere are also the people who just flat out say you can’t do something if you’re not part of a certain “race”, i.e. can’t wear dreadlocks or braids if you’re black. Can’t do this and that if you’re not, say, Asian or whatever. Maybe I’m just built different but...trying to regulate what a person can and can’t do based on their “race” sounds pretty damn racist, particularly when it’s done in hypocrisy.  \n\nThese accusers are working under the assumption that because of a person being black, something negative will happen to them, without any consideration of the context of what they are criticising and its nuances, and this is an expression of one’s (internalised) racism. Furthermore, the accusations of cultural appropriation also functions as a device to assert dominance in power dynamics. The notion of “cultural appreciation” basically being a euphemism of begging and grovelling for permission to use something that in reality you don’t need permission to use, and the said minority group trying to administer permissions doesn’t ask for when appropriating other cultures themselves. Trying to police what others can and can’t do is a form of control and a way to assert power, and despite the obvious hypocrisy and double standards these minority groups tend to execute and the actual lack of care for respecting cultures, it’s simply used as a device to control people, or particularly the majority group that is the point of ire, as opposed to the action being legitimately problematic.\n\nMe writing this isn’t to say that cultural appropriation is a myth, or to say that no person of a minority group has never been critiqued for cultural appropriation, but simply to point out the double standards of offences of the same intensity. I think it’s real, but that it’s almost always inaccurate and that it’s misused in a malicious and racist manner to many times express prejudice against groups of people.",
