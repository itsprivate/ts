Normal citizens are restricted to buying properties based on their personal income; holdings and properties can be used for collateral, but the mortgage/purchase price of a home is generally directly proportional to their personal taxable income (for example, I own 1-2M+ in assets, but I can&#39;t get a mortgage because at the moment my income is 0). This situation results in major inequality and eventually the endgame is businesses own most residential and everyone else rents. That is terrible for an economy and a middle class. Rent is also sky-high across the country, increasing faster than wages.</p>\n\n<p>My solution: Individuals are able to purchase as much land/as many residential properties as they want, however their total property purchasing ability is based on a 2-3 years average of taxable income. So, even if you have the assets to buy a property cash, you need to have your taxable income at a certain point to even qualify for the purchase, and if you&#39;re over the total limit, tough luck, go buy another asset. Homes are too important to sell to the highest bidder. Individuals would also be able to rent out those properties, however (and this is a separate post) the amount should be heavily rent controlled. So landlords don&#39;t necessarily go away, but the market is freed up and the rent controlled. </p>\n\n<p>Businesses would not be allowed to purchase residential properties any more. They would still be able to do business and entertainment properties. Existing residential properties are purchased from the companies at retail cost. This has precedent; it just happened in Germany, and Trump seized several properties for his Border Wall. Seizing property for the greater good is acceptable already. Any large business-owned apartment buildings would then be partially owned by each tenant, and HOA would govern each building, sharing costs and profits. </p>\n\n<p>This would result in a few benefits, and I don&#39;t see a con.</p>\n\n<p>-More regular people would own property, improving the vitality of the middle class and reducing income inequality.</p>\n\n<p>-Rich individuals would have to increase their taxable income (and pay more tax) to be able to take their advantage on the situation. They are still rewarded for having higher incomes as they can purchase larger/more homes</p>\n\n<p>-Businesses won&#39;t be able to corner the market and exploit people who live cheque to cheque.</p>\n\n<p>You could change my view by showing me a major flaw that actually results in worse situation for the regular people. I do not believe businesses should have the right to buy whatever they want just because they have the money so that won&#39;t change it. </p>\n\n<p>CMV.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Let&#39;s use the USA as an example</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
