When it bonds to your brain receptors, it slows down the communication between neurons.  Sleep is the body and brain&#39;s way of recharging and cleaning out adenosine.</p>\n\n<p>Caffeine just so happens to bond to the same receptors that adenosine does.  However, unlike adenosine, neuron communication is not hindered.  This is why caffeine seemingly gives you brain energy.</p>\n\n<p>For coffee to begin to affect you, it needs at least 20 minutes from the moment of consumption to when it finally hits your brain.  A quick 20 to 30 minute nap is also still significant enough to clean out some of the adenosine in your brain.</p>\n\n<p>With a Coffee Nap, as it&#39;s referred to, both of the beneficial processes occur at once.  Adenosine is cleaned up from the brain, while the caffeine from coffee replaces the adenosine&#39;s spot on your brain receptors.  Thus, when you wake up, you&#39;re way more energized and alert than if you had chosen to do one of the two activities.</p>\n\n<p>Science Studies Supporting This:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8936399/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8936399/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9401427/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9401427/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245703002554\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245703002554</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8026448/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8026448/</a></p>\n\n<p>Explanation on Coffee Naps - <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-nap#what-it-is\">https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-nap#what-it-is</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
