Unnecessary dental procedures are by far the most common and most costly of all dental scams. According to a <a href=\"https://www.smilecaredental.ca/blog/dentist-scams-and-unnecessary-dental-treatment\">reputable Canadian dentist</a>, &quot;Any person who learns how to avoid unnecessary dental procedures will save more than 50% on dental costs over their lifetime!&quot;... which is very concerning when you think about it.</p>\n\n<p>My former dental office would constantly tell me that I required dental x-rays, denying that I had recently had them taken. Each time this would happen, I would get out my phone, take a look at the date I recorded for the last time I had them taken, look at the official American Dental Association recommendations, and prove to them that they&#39;re just trying to scam me. It&#39;s a shame that most people would take the dental office&#39;s word and get exposed to unnecessary radiation while simultaneously wasting their money/dental insurance coverage for something they don&#39;t need.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, back to the wisdom teeth removal part...</p>\n\n<p>So, that same dental office now says that I will need wisdom teeth removal surgery. Since I couldn&#39;t really trust my dentist in the first place, I wanted a second opinion on this recommendation. I went to my former orthodontist, who just so happens to be one of the most reputable in my city, where I got my braces from when I was younger. She just laughed, saying that my wisdom teeth do not need removing whatsoever, confirming my skepticism with my dentist.</p>\n\n<p>The orthodontist also explained that dentists, especially in Canada and the US, will try to pressure you into a wisdom teeth removal surgery that you don&#39;t really need since they get a sort of &quot;referral bonus&quot; from the dental surgeon each time one of their patients is referred to get a surgery.</p>\n\n<p>Think about how terrible and uncalled for this is... the risks involved with anesthesia, the cost of the procedure for the patients, the risk of a failed procedure, the stress it puts on the patients, and the list goes on. All of this so that dentists can make some extra $.</p>\n\n<p>Do your research before your next dental appointment.
