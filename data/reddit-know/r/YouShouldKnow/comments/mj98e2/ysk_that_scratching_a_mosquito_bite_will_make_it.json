Histamine is what causes the typical itching, swelling and inflammation.\n\nSo if you scratch the area around the bite, it will be even more inflamed and will therefore itch more. So you will scratch even more and just like that the cycle continues.\n\nAlso, the scratching may break your skin, which can cause an infection that will itch. It will take time to heal and may leave a scar.\n\nSo in conclusion, don’t scratch mosquito bites.\n\nWhy YSK:  \nBecause probably no one wants itchy skin or an infection.\n\nSource:  \n[healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/why-mosquito-bites-itch)",
