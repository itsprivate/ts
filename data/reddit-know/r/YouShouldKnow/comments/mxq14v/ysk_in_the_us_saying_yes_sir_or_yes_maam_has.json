It's an American thing.\n\nIt's rare in the U.S., but sometimes people from other countries (especially in Northern Europe or other only-English speaking countries) get offended, like you're being too formal. It’s mostly just how we talk, but also shows respect for others. Americans say it to the 16 year old kid bagging the groceries because everyone deserves respect until they prove they don’t.\n\nBelieve it or not, I have a lot of experience with this (fwiw, I live in NY and have been to the south for about 10 months). I personally don't ever use \"sir/ma'am\" because my mom specifically used it to kiss authority figures' asses.\n\nI've talked to lots of other people from the UK, Australia, and Scandinavia, and they have identified \"sir/ma'am\" as an outdated mode of address because it wasn't egalitarian.\n\nBut I worked customer service at a Home Depot as a late teenager and insisted on never using \"sir/ma'am\" in my day-to-day life (although there was one exception that I will explain later). I found that most people, but young people especially, would always address me as \"sir.\" I even told some of them \"dude, there's no need to call me that; my name is Explorer as you'll see on my apron,\" but the response was \"yes sir.\" They disregarded my request and continued to call me \"sir,\" which goes to show how ingrained these words are, even in New York.\n\nOne day, I was intrigued enough with the \"sir\" shit that I decided to take it to the other extreme. Instead of never using \"sir/ma'am,\" I used them in every sentence I would say to a customer. Sometimes, I would go full metal jacket and use the \"sir/ma'am sandwich;\" for example, I would say, \"Sir, the ant killer is in aisle 38 sir.\" Although the idea was ludicrous and insane, believe it or not, people fucking loved it, and I was called \"sir\" at least 50 times that day (I started counting at some point).\n\nSo, for anyone from another country who is wondering about this, in the U.S., anyone who's providing a service and any stranger of any age had best be seen as an authority figure and warrants \"sir/ma'am\" and the commensurate degree of deference and formality. Most people in the U.S. who say \"I'm not old enough to be called 'sir/ma'am'\" will still get a warm feeling inside from being shown that respect. In fact, if you call these people (and most others) \"sir/ma'am\" enough times, they will begin to address you in that way too.\n\nWe are a formal nation.",
