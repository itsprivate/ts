Restaurants are FORCED to inflate menu prices because of the 20-30% delivery service fees. Another misleading fact is that those ads you see all the time for “free delivery” really mean “no delivery fee.” There are also 15-20% service fees, surge fees, and minimum cart fees. Sales taxes are also calculated differently from app to app! I usually avoid these fees by picking up the food myself or calling in my order for delivery. If I really want to splurge, I'll order delivery, but because I'm cheap, I'll use a food delivery aggregator. This [aggregator](https://foodboss.org/) has a website and compares Ubereats and Eatstreet. I used them for a while and saved a good amount of money. The only other option is this other [aggregator](https://www.mealme.ai/) that compares DoorDash, Ubereats, GrubHub, Postmates, and some other ones. They messed up my first order but they gave me a promo code, so I've been using this one more since they compare more services. Whatever you choose, make sure to always tip-- the drivers definitely deserve/need it!",
