There are people asking for 6&#39;+ but those are usually younger people who are living their lives and not settling down yet, it&#39;s much less common as you get older and see more people looking for serious relationships. Also most people really don&#39;t care about your height so don&#39;t let the relative few that do bother you. </p>\n\n<p>And 5&#39;9 is still pretty tall, you can reach most high shelves and the tops of the fridge. And for my guys in the lower range let me tell you, have a taller partner  is pretty cool cause you get to either be the little spoon or the jet pack while cuddling and both are a good time. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let your height be something that hold you back or keeps you down because it&#39;s not a big deal, and honestly as a 5&#39;10-5&#39;11 guy (depends on the time of day) the world just seems more comfortable if your a bit shorter. So accept it and let your confidence grow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
