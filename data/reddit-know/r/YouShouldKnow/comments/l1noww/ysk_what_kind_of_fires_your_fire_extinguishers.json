Remove one of those, and the fire will die.\n\nNow for the extinguishers themselves, let’s first talk about the types of fires.\n\nThere are 5 types of fire categories- A, B, C, D, and K.\n\nType A- These are ordinary combustibles like paper and wood. \n\nType B- These are fires that are caused by liquids like gas or oil.\n\nType C- These are fires called by electrical conduction from sources such as wires, and circuit boards.\n\nType D- These are fires caused by combustible metals like magnesium.\n\nType K- These are fires caused by cooking fats or grease.\n\nSo why does this matter? Because the extinguishers may have been meant to put fires out for one or maybe two specific types, but not all of them.\n\nFor example, Using a Type-A fire extinguisher on a Type-C Fire could potentially cause you to get electrocuted because it’s water based (water and electricity don’t mix as we all know).\n\nYou can tell what type of fires it meant to extinguished based upon the letter(s) displayed on the fire extinguisher’s label.\n\nAlso, when using it, aim low at the base of the fire and spray sweeping from side-to-side. (P.A.S.S. - Pull, aim, squeeze, sweep).\n\nI hope this helps. \n\nNote: I’m seeing images of tables that have categories that say E & F. I’m going based off what my workplace’s training taught me. I’m not sure if there are different standards for each country or not so I can’t comment on those.\n\nNote: Thank you all for the upvotes and awards!\n\n[Dangers of using the incorrect Fire Extinguisher](https://www.cheshirefire.net/news/dangers-using-incorrect-fire-extinguisher/)\n\n[What are the dangers of using the incorrect fire extinguisher?](https://aaafirepro.com/2018/06/what-are-the-dangers-of-using-the-incorrect-fire-extinguisher/)",
