Instead, it adheres to hair and dead skin cells so there’s less risk of hair breakage and skin irritation. Because of this, some people report less pain with sugaring. On the other hand, waxing adheres completely to the top layer of the skin. Typically, hard waxes hurt less than soft waxes.</p>\n\n<p>Additional personal note: you don&#39;t have to re-heat \n/&quot;cook&quot; the sugaring paste if you bought a pre-made kit/paste. Just simply get an enough amount, knead and you&#39;re good to go unlike with waxing that you need to have the wax melter! Also, sugaring doesn&#39;t need the waxing stick nor waxing strips although you can use a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=sugaring+paste+applicator&amp;client=ms-android-oppo-rev1&amp;biw=424&amp;bih=830&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=sivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO6OXVoYnyAhXHZd4KHeFLB0sQ_AUIFygC#imgrc=qgz8Cejp41tctM\">sugaring paste applicator</a> if you don&#39;t want your hands to be also applied with the paste (although you can just simply wash it with water afterwards)</p>\n\n<p>For additional information: <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/sugaring-vs-waxing#during-the-appointment\">Here is a link for the full comparison between sugaring and waxing</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
