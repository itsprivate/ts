Pit vipers include rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the recommendation is to find immediate medical assistance for crofab antivenom, keep as calm as possible, and elevate the bitten extremity once in the hands of doctors to reduce tissue damage when resting. This is because the venom of a pit viper causes localized effects, not system-wide. Elevating the bite prevents excess swelling and tissue damage.</p>\n\n<p>For some snakes, such as elapids and true vipers, lowering the bite is the better course of action. However, sucking out the venom is <em>never</em> recommended in any case.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/natural-world/how-to-position-a-snakebite-9430fc988af\">https://medium.com/natural-world/how-to-position-a-snakebite-9430fc988af</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ems1.com/health-wellness/articles/the-ems-guide-to-treating-snakebites-ZqCHhfMtA0US0uo2/\">https://www.ems1.com/health-wellness/articles/the-ems-guide-to-treating-snakebites-ZqCHhfMtA0US0uo2/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
