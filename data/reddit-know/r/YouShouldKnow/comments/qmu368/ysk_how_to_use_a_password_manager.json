And managers like Bitwarden even offer stuff like auto-fill (with fingerprint/facial authentication etc) which is really convenient. All your accounts are in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK:<br/>\n1 - It&#39;s not safe to use browsers&#39; password storage because if you leave your device unlocked anyone can access your accounts because there is no further validation, just the click of a button.</p>\n\n<p>2 - For chrome especially, since it&#39;s owned by google, you might (and should) not feel safe with their privacy policies so there&#39;s that.</p>\n\n<p>Please update yourself, and be safe, you can&#39;t even imagine the damage stolen credentials can make. Even if you think &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot;.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
