For 2 years, I was using 2 cans of 6 mg zyn per day, 3 bottles of premium kratom extract per day, and a half bottle of whisky every night. I felt trapped and that there was no hope of ever being able to stop. \n\nDisclaimer: While my substances may not be hardcore drugs you see on tv, I was once addicted to pain pills for a year and I would put the grasp of my kratom and nicotine addiction in the same realm as that opiate addiction.  That was my experience, others I’m sure differ. \n\nWhy YSK: I’m sharing my embarrassing story because there are people that feel the same empty way every day and I want you or a loved one to recognize the normality of the lie and feel the hope that was hidden from me for so long. \n\nEach morning, my brain would trick me into thinking there was no way I could function without popping in some zyn then later I would “need” kratom to boost my mood and at night I would “need” alcohol to chill out, forget about a stressful day, and fall asleep. \n\nMy brain used every excuse in the book “I have an addictive personality” “my job is so stressful and I need these to be successful” “these aren’t hardcore drugs” but ultimately and deep down I felt no hope and didn’t think I could ever stop. It was impossible to see my life without “my” substances. \n\nI’m now free of all 3 of my addictions and I knocked them out one at a time. I feel the hope and joy that I once thought was lost forever. This post is about hope and not my method or motivations. But Im happy to answer questions through comments or messages if it would help you. \n\nThere is hope, your brain is tricking you, you can do this. Let’s do it together.",
