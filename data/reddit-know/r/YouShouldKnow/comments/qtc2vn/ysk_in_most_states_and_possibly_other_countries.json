Ive been in the car w a 1 year old baby with an impacted bowel and we got stuck behind someone who refused to pass the person they were riding next to. I&#39;ve also read about a tree-worker who sliced his leg w his chainsaw (on accident), bled out in the car and died bc a woman felt it was her job to &quot;slow down the speeders.&quot; (She was later arrested for manslaughter.)</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line - don&#39;t be an asshole on the road - you never know who behind you may be dying, and your actions could be the difference between life and death.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
