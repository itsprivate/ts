They drop hints about the profit they&#39;re making off cryptocurrency &quot;investments&quot; and wait for you to ask them to help you invest. Slowly fattening you for slaughter - thus pig butchering. </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK:  because this kind of scam is getting more common in the West and anyone who&#39;s active online - especially people online dating - should be aware of the risk.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
