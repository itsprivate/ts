I noticed by the end that while we washed the bottle and cap by hand every night and ran it through the dishwasher every weekend, the valve had some pretty tight spots that weren&#39;t getting cleaned out.</p>\n\n<p>Well, of course, it was time to go adventuring. Turns out you can remove the bite valve with a little careful prying. This isn&#39;t documented in the cleaning instructions on Klean Kanteen&#39;s site (or if it is, I couldn&#39;t find it).</p>\n\n<p>The bite valve is made of rubber with two &quot;barbed&quot; flanges on opposing sides. Stick two flathead screwdrivers against the barbs, and wiggle down and in until the barbs are fully flattened against the side of the tube. Be careful, if you pry, you can easily dent the plastic housing.</p>\n\n<p>When the barbs are fully disengaged, the rubber valve can be pulled out the top with little effort.</p>\n\n<p>There was an asston of nasty black biofilm sludge on the valve. We only use water in it. Of course, he&#39;s a grade schooler and is otherwise pretty disgusting, but I imagine this could happen to anyone.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/2sfd1iu\">https://imgur.com/gallery/2sfd1iu</a></p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: The Klean Kanteen cap can look clean but is hiding nasty crap you probably don&#39;t want to (or know you are) drinking.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
