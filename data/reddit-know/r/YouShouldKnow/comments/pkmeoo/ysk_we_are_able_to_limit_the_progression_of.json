The longer the eye, the higher the prescription, and the higher the risk of things like retinal detachment, glaucoma, and a certain type of macular degeneration. This lengthening of the eye occurs as children grow. If we can intervene early, we can prevent excessive growth and significantly limit these risks.</p>\n\n<p>We are able to slow the process of eye lengthening by a few methods. One is MiSight contact lenses, an FDA approved daily soft lens designed for this purpose. Second is low dose atropine eye drops, one drop per day in each eye. Third is orthokeratology, a hard lens worn overnight that changes the shape of the cornea and gives good vision during the day while wearing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>How does this work? The previously mentioned methods all provide what is known as peripheral defocus. With normal glasses or contacts, light focuses on the retina everywhere for the most part, providing good vision. With peripheral defocus, light focuses on the retina centrally providing clear vision, but focuses in front of the retina in the periphery. This sends the signal to the developing eye to stop growing, and is what slows the lengthening process.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a child that is -4.00D at 8 years old may eventually become -10.00D if we do not intervene. If we do intervene, maybe they max out at -6.00D or somewhere around there. That has huge implications for eye health and quality of life as an adult. Every diopter is significant.</p>\n\n<p>If you are young, get your eyes examined, you may possibly still benefit. If you have kids or plan to have kids, make sure they get eye exams too.</p>\n\n<p>In short, we can slow or stop the progression of nearsightedness in children. Get your eye exams, and get your kids eye exams if you have them or ever have them. There are huge eye health and quality of life benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Studies:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2019/08000/A_3_year_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_of_MiSight.3.aspx\">MiSight Contact Lenses</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161642015006752\">ATOM1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161642011006853\">ATOM2</a> studies for atropine treatment for myopia</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
