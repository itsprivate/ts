Your chances of getting a favorable outcome are negligible.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood does not provide an opportunity to opt-out of arbitration, so the arbitration clause may be less likely to be enforced. But most other services <em>do</em> have opt-out for their arbitration clauses.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you don&#39;t want to get fucked over <em>in the  future</em>, always opt out when possible.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am not a lawyer and I am US based. Arbitration clauses are legal and upheld in the United States. Arbitration has been repeatedly strengthened by various cases in our Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: Always check the Terms for &quot;arbitration&quot;, and see if and how you can opt out.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
