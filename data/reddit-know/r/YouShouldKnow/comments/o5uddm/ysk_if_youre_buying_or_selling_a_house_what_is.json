Common items that are considered fixtures include: window blinds and curtain rods, built in shelves, chandeliers and ceiling fans, appliances that are built into cabinets like dishwashers, out buildings like sheds, and trees or plants in the ground.  Common items that are NOT considered fixtures include: drapes, shower curtains, refrigerators that are not built into a cabinet, countertop appliances, and plants in pots.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>A common point of contention is attachments for hanging flat screen TVs on walls. They are &quot;physically and permanently&quot; attached to the wall, and normally should be included. But many times they are only good with the brand/size of TV they are made for, and probably useless to the buyer.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you are buying a house and want to make sure something is included, its always a good idea to ask. Sellers may be willing to include things that are not normally considered fixtures that they may not be able to use again, or just to avoid moving it to the next house, like custom sized drapes or an extra refrigerator in the basement.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you are selling a house and want to take something that normally would be considered a fixture, you can put this in the contract as an exclusion. For example, some people may be very attached to a tree or plants they put in, and want to take them along to their next house. If you don&#39;t put this in the contract, the buyer could sue and force you to pay to replace them.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edited to add: I see there is some discussion over the definition of what &quot;permanently&quot; attached means. In the case of real estate law, it is generally defined as &quot;affixed to the property through the application of plaster, cement, bolts, screws, nuts, or nails.&quot; i.e. if you need tools to remove it, its usually considered &quot;permanently&quot; attached.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
