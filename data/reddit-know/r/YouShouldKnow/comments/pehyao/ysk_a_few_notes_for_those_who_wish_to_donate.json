Here&#39;s a few guidelines that will help your items get to its well-intended destination:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If it&#39;s super used, falling apart, dirt covered - don&#39;t donate it. It will end up in the trash! If you wouldn&#39;t donate it to your best friend after a house fire, then it&#39;s not worth donating!</li>\n<li>Think about the time you moved into your first apartment or dorm, and all you needed for it. House trash cans, hand soap, a lamp, a chair and table, a nice little set of plates and cups and cutlery, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what they need...not your old bowling balls and popcorn makers!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tie shoes together so they don&#39;t get separated. I just had to throw away 3 black bags full of shoes that lost their mate! Use the shoelaces, or a twist tie, or a bit of thread.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use a rubber band to keep sets of stuff together, especially kitchen items or cutlery sets. I also threw away a small batch of cutlery that was like 5 loose, random knives and forks! While cutlery seems useful, it isn&#39;t when loose, or just a few random things thrown into a bag of kids toys. There&#39;s not enough staffing/volunteers/sorting time to spend time putting together useable sets from multiple different places.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not many wish to donate cash, but if it&#39;s donated, it doesn&#39;t go directly into the hands of homeless. Instead, $ goes to keep the doors open and lights on, because unlike certain well-known thrift stores, many of the places that are setting up to welcome refugees or truly help homeless do not sell the items. The $ also goes to spending on necessary basics - socks, underwear packs, tees, toothpaste, even used to bulk purchase these items for bigger discounts!</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
