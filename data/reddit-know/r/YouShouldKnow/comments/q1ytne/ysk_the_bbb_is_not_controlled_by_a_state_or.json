It is not. It is basically a fancier version of Yelp. Companies pay the BBB to be accredited so that the BBB can help protect them from consumer complaints (read: work in favor of companies). Not all consumer complaints are posted if the company can provide some kind of resolution to a consumer complaint. My company has had close to 100 complaints submitted through the BBB. Because we were able to resolve those issues before they went public, you will only see 3 or 4 complaints posted on our BBB profile. So, just because a company isn’t BBB accredited, it doesn’t necessarily make them a bad company.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
