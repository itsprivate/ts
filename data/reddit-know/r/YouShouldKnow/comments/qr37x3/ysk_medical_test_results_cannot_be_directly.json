With this comes the risk of misinterpretation. I work in a hospital lab, here are some tips:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Reference ranges are normal ranges for a test.  However, they are specific to the lab producing the result. You can find published reference ranges online, however the labs ranges account for various factors and is more accurate. </p></li>\n<li><p>Labs have different ways of analyzing specific tests.  If two labs use different methods, it’s highly likely they will produce different numbers.  The results cannot be compared to each other directly.  Instead, compare each result to that labs reference range, come to a conclusion and then compare (ie high vs normal)</p></li>\n<li><p>Even within a lab, error exists. Labs use quality control materials with expected values to control the performance of tests. However, these controls have acceptable ranges.  This means, day to day, test may run slightly high or slightly low and still be within acceptability. </p></li>\n<li><p>Reportable ranges are set based on clinical relevance. If your B12 level is higher than normal, it’s not clinically relevant.  Often times labs will not bother to extend their reportable range beyond this. You’ll end up seeing results like “&gt;1000” or “&lt;10” etc. </p></li>\n<li><p>Be wary of rabbit holing. If normal range for rheumatoid factor is &lt;10 IU/ml and you have results of 2, 5, and 8 over the past few months, there likely is still nothing to act on.  Normal is normal, don’t drive yourself crazy looking for trends. Labs have error and small trends like this are indistinguishable from that noise.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Source: work in medical lab</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
