They might try to make you incriminate yourself - it’s a common practice in some countries for the police to first interrogate you as a witness and only then as a suspect, because as a suspect you have more rights.\n\nI know some of you might get shot for doing so, but if the police starts to act like they are taking away your freedom ask them „AM I BEING DETAINED” and if they respond „yes” don’t say ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL. If they show up at your meth lab just shut the fuck up, wait to see your lawyer and only say what they told you to.\n\nWhy YSK: Everyone should know their rights and what to do not to incriminate themselves. Lots, LOTS of innocent people have confessed to crimes they didn’t commit, simply because they thought that the police has evidence strong enough to convict them so it’s better to confess and get a better deal.",
