WHY SHOULDNT PEOPLE KNOW THIS. \nI was never told about this and had to do my own research to figure out that the pill has a weight limit, I talked to my doctor about it and she even told me that this was true. I told all my friends/family this and none of them knew either ! </p>\n\n<p>I believe this to be incredibly important for everyone to know, if you&#39;re using this as an emergency contraceptive you should 100% be made aware of the fact that Plan B is less effective in women 165 - 176 lbs and entirely ineffective in women over 176. </p>\n\n<p>Please everyone take care of yourselves and practice safe sex. There are other options for you if you are over this weight and I highly recommend looking into them instead of relying on the pill that could leave you spending money for something that will not work- AND PREGNANT.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: \nJust some helpful links others shared &amp; I found myself! Again, please stay safe out there and choose the BC that will be best suited to you! Talking to a healthcare professional will be your best bet on advice should you ever need anything or would like more info! </p>\n\n<p>Ella works for women up to 195 pounds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/blog/5-fast-facts-about-ella-emergency-contraception\">https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/blog/5-fast-facts-about-ella-emergency-contraception</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/august-2014-pregnant-pause/\">https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/august-2014-pregnant-pause/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tb1838\">https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tb1838</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use\">https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
