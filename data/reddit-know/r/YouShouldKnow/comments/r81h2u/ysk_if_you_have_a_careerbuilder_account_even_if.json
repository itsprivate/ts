I received an application through Career Builder for a Truck Driver/Warehouse position yesterday. I spoke with the manager of my company and she advised me that if your resume and information is on CareerBuilder; CareerBuilder will apply on behalf of the candidate. I greatly apologize for the mix up and inconvenience.  I have deleted your information and you will no longer be contacted by our staffing company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: If you have received similar notifications, you did not have your identity compromised, apparently CareerBuilder is just resorting to desperate measures to increase their numbers. Time to delete!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
