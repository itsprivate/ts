It pulls together the products from clothing, home decor, kids, etc. stores near you and lets you shop them in one place rather than having to go to small-businesses’ websites 1-by-1. It also lets you filter the products by price and how close they are to you -- which alleviated a lot of my fears about unique products being too expensive and that they wouldn’t get to me in time. My girlfriend is super buy-local so I used it over the holidays to buy her gifts -- a ring, a plant and a backpack. It was actually super fun to see all these unique stores with unique products in one spot -- a lot less boring than going to your typical corporate retailer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
