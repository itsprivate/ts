And it all came from a single aggregator's database, who collected it from all my Dr's (Medical, Dental, Vision, and Mental), Hospitals, Labs and Pharmacies.\n\nAnd just remember, if they can get access to it, so can hackers. This will make me second guess what I tell the Dr during future visits, which is incredibly sad and dangerous for overall health.",
