The US has very strict HIPAA laws that protect any info we share with a Dr and our medical records.</em></p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>I was glad when medical records went online. Easy to access all my Dr&#39;s visits, instant alerts for labs, and no more calling in or waiting on the mail for bills! However my mind changed when I recently applied for Executive Life Insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The process was thorough, meaning not only did I fill out a lot of forms and take a lot of tests, they also checked my medical history to make sure I wasn&#39;t lying. I had to sign a waiver saying they could access all my medical records - figured it was just ER visits and major diagnosis (cancer, depression, etc).</p>\n\n<p>What I found out was shocking - here are some examples of questions they asked me after my EHR&#39;s (Electronic Health Records) were analyzed by them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Why did you put you&#39;re not a drug user when your Dr&#39;s notes in 2010 said you smoked marijuana?&quot; <em>(I smoked a little in college, but not anymore)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you put you don&#39;t suffer from anxiety/depression when you were prescribed Xanax in 2015?&quot; <em>(I had some dental work done, and the Dentist literally prescribed me 1 pill to ease the anxiety before the appointment)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you say you don&#39;t suffer from anxiety/depression when you went to a therapist in 2016?&quot; <em>(I had some big changes in my life that I needed help with)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you say you&#39;ve never had any heart issues when you had an EKG in 2018?&quot; <em>(This was part of a normal health screening)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: They had ALL my records - Lab Tests, Prescription Fills, Diagnosis&#39;, Insurance...and scariest, personal Dr&#39;s Notes. And it all came from a single aggregator&#39;s database, who collected it from all my Dr&#39;s (Medical, Dental, Vision, and Mental), Hospitals, Labs and Pharmacies.</p>\n\n<p>And just remember, if they can get access to it, so can hackers. This will make me second guess what I tell the Dr during future visits, which is incredibly sad and dangerous for overall health.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
