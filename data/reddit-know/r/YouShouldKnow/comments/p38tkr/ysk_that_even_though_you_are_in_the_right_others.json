It&#39;s somewhat easy to avoid these types of accidents if you look both ways, regardless of your right to immediately go. It&#39;s sad, but there are many people who have actually died from not checking, thinking that it&#39;s clear, then getting slammed into from someone who ran the red, typically speeding.

So, even though you can be a perfect driver, there are always people around you that pose a danger.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
