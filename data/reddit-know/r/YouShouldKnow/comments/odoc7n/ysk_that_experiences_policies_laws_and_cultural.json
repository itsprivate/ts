But the way we all live with these things really depends on <strong>where</strong> we live. </p>\n\n<p>There are 50 states (and several territories) and tens of thousands of municipalities. The way government does its job most often depends on <strong>local government</strong>. For the most part, states, counties, and cities make and enforce the rules. Federal law gives wide latitude for this, as intended by the country&#39;s founders.</p>\n\n<p>Economics and availability of amenities depends on whether the environment is more rural or urban. And boy, do we have lots of both extremes.</p>\n\n<p>Cultural phenomena and traditions depend on the region; the Deep South is quite different from Northern California. And even within the South, rural living and living in say, Nashville or Atlanta, really make life experiences quite different. This applies especially to education and cost of living!</p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s not just problems; triumphs and celebrations don&#39;t matter equally to everyone. I live in New York City, and I promise you that if the Giants or Jets won the Super Bowl, you wouldn&#39;t notice a thing. But in Pittsburgh, <em>when</em> the Steelers win... it&#39;s absolute bedlam. (Where I grew up, nobody watches it because we only care about college football.)</p>\n\n<p>The USA is a huge piece of land with a giant, diverse population. As we celebrate Independence Day, I hope people both outside of and within this country understand that stereotypes can be real, clichés do often apply, and criticisms can be valid... but half the time they likely don&#39;t apply to most of the population.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I love this country and I believe that what unites us is our evolving variety of experience from place to place within our borders. If you&#39;ve never been to the USA, come visit. See New York and New Mexico. Go to the beach in Alabama and California. Drive by hillside mansions, city blocks, suburban sprawl, and red dirt trailer parks. Listen to accents from Wisconsin and Louisiana and Spanish Harlem. Visit the so-called red states and blue states. And tell everybody what you saw.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
