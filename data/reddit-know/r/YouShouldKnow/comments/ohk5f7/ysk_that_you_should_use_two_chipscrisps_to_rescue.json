When you go in for the rescue you should use TWO crisps/chips to get it out of the dipping sauce and not a single second one.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: If you only use one rescue chip/crisp, the odds are very high that it will break as well. The first one couldn&#39;t handle the dip and broke, and the second one will likely suffer the same faith if you use it to scoop out The Broken One&#39;s remains. This prevents you from having to go in and cover your fingers in dip. It&#39;s also much more hygienic. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of using one crisp/chip, use two for the rescue. You can do this either by: 1) putting them onto each other and use the strength of two crisps/chips to scoop out The Broken One or 2) using them as chop sticks or pincers to grab The Broken One from the dip. Method 1 will generally come with greater amounts of dip than Method 2.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
