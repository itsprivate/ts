OP was wondering why their retirement account seemed low after ten years of contributions and came to the realization that by selecting &quot;conservative&quot; on the type of investment survey they were 100% invested in bonds - something you wouldn&#39;t want to do unless you are well into retirement and focused on preserving your money in the safest way possible instead of growing it through riskier options. By doing this for ten years, they missed out on possibly 1-2 MILLION dollars of retirement income.</p>\n\n<p>A great analogy I read was that your IRA (or other retirement account) is the vehicle and the investments are the highway. The vehicle is designed to be advantageous to ride in until retirement (utilizing tax benefits) but won&#39;t go anywhere unless you choose which highway (investments) to put it on.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a company sponsored plan, sometimes they will automatically put your contributions in a Target Date Fund - an investment designed to be completely hands off, optimized for your approximate retirement date. That is a perfectly fine option.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes they will ask you to choose which fund or type of investment you want, which may not always be clear - in the earlier example OP chose &quot;conservative&quot; because that sounded like a safe, logical, choice, without realizing what that actually meant.</p>\n\n<p>If you are setting up your own IRA, you will always, (or almost always, there may be some exceptions) need to choose an investment option or the money will just sit there as cash forever. Sometimes it will stay in a money market account, which is essentially a savings account that will earn you maybe slightly more interest than leaving it in your bank.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever type of retirement account(s) you have, if you are not positive what your money is invested in, take a moment to log in to your account and view exactly what is going on. This is also a good opportunity to examine what fees you are paying and determine if better, lower cost, options are available to you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
