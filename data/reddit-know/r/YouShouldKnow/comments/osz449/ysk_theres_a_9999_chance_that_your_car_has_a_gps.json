  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A few days ago a friend of mine (a salesman at a Jeep dealership) told me they install GPS tracking devices and ignition cutoff switches in every vehicle they sell (used and new) so that lenders can track your vehicle and disable it if you miss a payment. I started doing some digging online and calling some other dealerships and they confirmed the information. We&#39;re not talking about &quot;Buy Here Pay Here&quot; car lots.. I&#39;m talking about l<em>egitimate dealerships.</em> And technically, you consent to it since it&#39;s hidden in the fine print of all those contracts that you sign at the time of purchase. And you most likely paid an extra couple hundred dollars for them to install it! </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: The really interesting part is even if you pay for your car in full at the time of purchase, you still have the GPS and ignition cutoffs pre-installed. But <em>you</em> can&#39;t use them. <em>You</em> don&#39;t have access to these services, even though it&#39;s always actively running (as long as your battery is hooked up). <em>You</em> aren&#39;t notified if someone accesses that information without your knowledge. The dealership (and whoever else) could access this information any time they want for any reason they want because <em>you can&#39;t confirm if/when it&#39;s happening because you don&#39;t have access to it.</em> </p>\n\n<p>I paid for my Jeep in full at the time of purchase and I can confirm the Jeep dealership installed a GPS tracker and ignition cutoff in my vehicle as well. I cut the wires, spliced everything back together and called the dealership that sold it to me. I asked them to give me access to the tracking and ignition cut off services, all the records and documents relating to these devices, and a list of anyone whose ever viewed or pinged my location with their reason for doing so. I was told &quot;we can&#39;t do that&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m not sure where that information would be.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>These GPS trackers theoretically could be placed anywhere. But 95% of the time they&#39;re located under the steering wheel by the OBD port and/or fuse box. You&#39;ll need to remove the plastic panel from below your steering wheel to see the device(s) but it&#39;s pretty easy - there will be 3 or 4 screws at the bottom of the plastic panel (just above the gas/brake pedal). After you remove the panel search YouTube for some videos of people removing the GPS trackers and proceed to cut them off your vehicle. It will be a black box that looks different from the rest, most likely spliced to your OBD port. Note: Be sure to read the terms of your lease/loan (if you have one) to make sure you&#39;re not violating your contract by removing these devices. </p>\n\n<p>I have no idea how this is legal for them to do and seriously, FUCK the dealerships who install these and sneak it past customers. Read the fine print like a hawk, question everything, and if you have one of these installed, I suggest removing it and running it TF over.</p>\n\n<p>(For context, I&#39;m in the USA)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
