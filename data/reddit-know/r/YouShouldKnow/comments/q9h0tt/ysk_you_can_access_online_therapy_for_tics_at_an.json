CBIT is a behavior therapy for tics that has been proven in research to help reduce tic severity for over half of people who try it, without medications. CBIT involves education about tics, skill-based lessons and daily practice. TicHelper leads you through the most important components of CBIT therapy via an interactive self-help platform. It&#39;s designed for kids, but also works for older teens and adults (who would just complete the parent components themselves). The cost is $150 USD for the entire 8-week access.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK - 1 person in 100 lives with a tic disorder but there are only of a handful of specialists trained in CBIT. This self-help platform makes this effective therapy approach available anywhere in the world. </p>\n\n<p>*Note - Scientific references:\n*<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615849/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615849/</a>\n*<a href=\"https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=CBIT+tocs+metaanalysis&amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DPbZpqEah0j0J\">https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=CBIT+tocs+metaanalysis&amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DPbZpqEah0j0J</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
