A contract is not a piece of paper, it&#39;s an agreement between two or more parties where and offer is made and accepted. For example, if I offer to sell you my car for $10,000, and you accept, we each have a legal right to enforce this deal in a court of US law.</p>\n\n<p>If I change my mind on the deal after accepting your offer, you can legally take me to court to make me turn over the car in exchange for the agreed upon amount, and if you try to short me by only showing up with $8,000, I can take you to court to make you pay the full amount, contingent on me being able to prove that I made an offer, and you accepted it. Even if the contract was purely verbal, it&#39;s still valid if you can prove it was made.</p>\n\n<p>So don&#39;t accept a deal you aren&#39;t prepared to keep, and if someone tries to back out of a deal they made with you, know that you have options.</p>\n\n<p>(Disclaimer: I&#39;m not a lawyer this is not official legal advice. I know this post is simplified. There are more caveats in contract law than could be explained in 12 years of law school, much less a post on Reddit.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
