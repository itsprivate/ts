This is especially true for things that don’t seem like a big deal to most people, and *even* more true if that other person already knows we personally don’t find it offensive and still makes it a point to apologize.\n\nIf they make an effort to sincerely apologize for something that we, or perhaps most people think of as a non issue (like chewing loudly, being 1-2 minutes late, forgetting to call back, keeping someone waiting, etc...)  they’re likely doing it because they place a high value on not engaging in that behavior and in the reverse they likely would have found it offensive or not ok.\n\nA good example is with being just ever slightly late. If someone makes it a point to *sincerely* apologize to you for being just 1 minute late, and you say to them “oh haha its really not a big deal, no problem”... While it might truly not have bothered you,if they seemed to find apologizing important to you, you should pay attention to that! \n\nWhat seems small or irrelevant to us, might be hugely important to someone else, and instead of just shrugging off someone’s apology for something that didn’t seem important or hurtful in our eyes we should see that as that person’s way of indirectly telling us “this is what is important to me” or “this is what I find most hurtful” and use it as a way to deepen and strengthen our relationship with that person.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the awards!! And I’m really glad this is resonating with a lot of you.",
