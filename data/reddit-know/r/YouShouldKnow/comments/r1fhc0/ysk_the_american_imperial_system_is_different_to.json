A fluid ounce is 28.41ml in British Imperial but 29.57ml in US Customary units. An imperial pint is 20 fl. oz. compared to 16 fl. oz. in the US and an imperial gallon is 160 fl. oz. compared to 128 fl. oz. in the US. </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: there are plenty of places where this is relevant, such as fuel prices and value for money, but in a word, baking. When following online recipes it is easy to mistake one for the other, for example for people in the UK who use both imperial and metric at different times, or for people in Canada where there&#39;s a lot of US imports, and this can lead to irredeemable mistakes with some of the more unforgiving recipes. If you&#39;re following an online recipe try to make sure you know which type of pints/fluid ounces is being used. A dead giveaway for US Customary units is Cups, as Cups are not used in the imperial system.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
