Mental healthcare is broken pretty much everywhere and many of us will count on digital solutions for help. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are a lot of problems with those, and you should be aware of them so you can make well-informed decisions about how you take care of your wellbeing. </p>\n\n<p>To cite just two examples from the article:<br/>\nOne, AI therapists/chatbots are nowhere close to mimicking human conversations that make you feel connected, heard and seen. They are machine-like, shallow and often insensitive. “For example, one chatbot, when told “I am depressed,” responded dismissively: ‘Maybe the weather is affecting you’.”</p>\n\n<p>Two, mental health apps can create self-stigma. “Users who are experiencing low-level symptoms of a disorder may feel labeled by an app that assumes that they have a clinical diagnosis. Self-stigma from this labeling can be harmful, lowering self-esteem and self-efficacy.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hazelgale.medium.com/mental-health-tech-is-broken-were-betting-on-games-to-fix-it-e1c413890a25\">Here’s</a> the full article.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
