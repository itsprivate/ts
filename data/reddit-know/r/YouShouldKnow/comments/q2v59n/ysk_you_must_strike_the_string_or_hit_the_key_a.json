They hear the beat coming up, and they play on the beat. The only problem is that every instrument has a very small delay before producing its peak amplitude. That peak should fall right on the beat, unless you are intentionally going for a different sound.</p>\n\n<p>Each instrument is different, with pianos on the short side and basses on the long side. I had this problem when I studied jazz. A conductor feels the beat just a bit before the orchestra plays it, so I developed an ear for giving the ensemble this feel. A jazz or rock beat is very rigid, and the rhythm section should stay on the front of the beat. My bass teacher called this getting &quot;in the pocket&quot;. When you&#39;re walking right on that edge at a good tempo, the song has a great energy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
