Too much focus is put on the workout itself without addressing the real problem of why so many start and then quit. Everyone struggles, but some have sourced the key, the right mental gymnastics to continue the regimen despite regular life pressures getting in the way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of joking the #1 cause of injury is exercise, I found myself at a crossroads when I had to run about 30 meters (100 feet). I was a mess, barely able to breathe. I loosened my shirt and my pants. I knew i wasn’t in good shape but I hadn’t considered I was in terrible shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started walking around the block, then longer, then jogging small parts, then jogging most of it, then moved on to hiking. I learned my body prefers Interval training, so I focused on this whether it was around the neighbourhood or into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 months I was noticeably more fit but I was still struggling mentally with just getting out the door. I always had SO MANY reasons to not exercise today, mostly related to urgency of other matters. Put simply, I would find important distractions and then convince myself it was “too late” to do it today and to try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took about 6 months of mental retraining to stop this bad habit while also convincing myself I enjoyed it. Some tricks I used:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 - Whatever other urgent thing you have to do, don&amp;#39;t argue with yourself on the priority  If you have a nagging mind like I do, I found it easier to just agree with the thought to skip today and then just do the exercise anyways.  Its like the old adage of not what you say, but what you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 - Any opportunity I had to talk about my training, I did so and said how much I loved it. Even though I was lying, I said I loved it and I said it to myself regularly as well. Weirdly, after awhile you start to actually love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 - Meditation, It helped a lot learning how to “let thoughts go”, even important valid thoughts. Just because something is important, it doesn’t mean it’s more important than your health. Let the valid and important thought go along with any other thoughts and do your exercises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 - Find anyone to do it with. Your friends keep you honest. Or get a dog. That sad look they give you, or excited when they hear keys, it really works. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 - Upper body and general muscle development are key not just for balance, but muscles burn more calories. You may not be as toned as the person putting in a couple hours a day, but any increase in muscle makes a better working body that burns more calories for the same amount of work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 - Even if its just 5 minutes. This is my go to when nothing else is working. It&amp;#39;s amazing how taking 5 minutes can turn into 15 and then into 30. And you feel like a boss afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 - Keep mixing it up. I go one day at the gym, then a neighborhood walk, then Beat Sabre, then a good hike, and then just drive somewhere new. I found I failed when it&amp;#39;s just the same thing over and over, every week, forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been 4 years now and I do love it and look forward to it each week. BUT!... I still mentally struggle with it. Or I should say the desire to skip it is always on the perimeter trying to get back in, and when it does, I just take my toolkit out and use one of my tricks to get back into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make this the year you make it stick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/6-mental-tricks-tricks-help-make-exercise-habit-ncna914386\"&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/6-mental-tricks-tricks-help-make-exercise-habit-ncna914386&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
