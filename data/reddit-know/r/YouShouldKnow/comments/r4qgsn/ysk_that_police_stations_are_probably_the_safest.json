He refused, and suggested a McDonald&#39;s parking lot in a sketchy neighborhood instead.  His refusal to meet at the police station sounded my alarm bells, especially when he couldn&#39;t articulate his objections to meeting there.  I called off the deal with him, and instead went with the next prospective buyer who not only had no objections to meeting at the police station, but expressed his appreciation for doing so at such a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.  Many police stations not only support this activity, but some will also provide a police officer to be present during the transaction upon request.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
