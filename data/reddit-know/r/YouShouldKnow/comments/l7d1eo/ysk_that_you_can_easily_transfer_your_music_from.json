I personally switched to Tidal but the process explained below works for most (if not all) music streaming services and even more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Export &quot;Service-to-Service:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I personally used <a href=\"https://soundiiz.com/\">Soundiiz</a> , because I used it in the past, to export everything in one go. It&#39;s free for a single playlist and up to 200 tracks but full export service-to-service if you pay for their service (subscription). </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Export to text file (.csv):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I exported as .csv all my playlists and tracks using <a href=\"https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify\">Exportify</a> ,  <a href=\"https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/\">(github)</a> . This includes the Spotify URI and other details such as disc number and track number. If you don&#39;t know what a .csv is just know that you can open it with Excel (or Calc if you&#39;re using Libre Office).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Podcasts?:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty alternatives, many more suited to podcast listening and discovery. I am looking into podcast apps so here&#39;s a list for that too https:/ /<a href=\"http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/07/07/best-free-podcast-apps/\">www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/07/07/best-free-podcast-apps/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
