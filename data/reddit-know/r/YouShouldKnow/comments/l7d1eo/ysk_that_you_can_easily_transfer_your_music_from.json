I personally switched to Tidal but the process explained below works for most (if not all) music streaming services and even more.\n\n**1. Export \"Service-to-Service:**\n\nI personally used [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/) , because I used it in the past, to export everything in one go. It's free for a single playlist and up to 200 tracks but full export service-to-service if you pay for their service (subscription). \n\n**2. Export to text file (.csv):**\n\nI exported as .csv all my playlists and tracks using [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) ,  [\\(github\\)](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/) . This includes the Spotify URI and other details such as disc number and track number. If you don't know what a .csv is just know that you can open it with Excel (or Calc if you're using Libre Office).\n\n**3. Podcasts?:**\n\nThere are plenty alternatives, many more suited to podcast listening and discovery. I am looking into podcast apps so here's a list for that too https:/ /www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/07/07/best-free-podcast-apps/.\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps!",
