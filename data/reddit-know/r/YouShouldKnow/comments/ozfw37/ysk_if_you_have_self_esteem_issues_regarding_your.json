I was appalled. Looking back on the situation, I realized that if the world&#39;s hottest guy can be labelled as ugly then you, the &quot;ugly&quot; viewer, can be assured that there exists a group of people who&#39;ll consider YOU the hottest person in the world. And that&#39;s very comforting to me so maybe it&#39;ll be the same to you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thought about deleting because some of you are Debbie downers, but that would just mean that you&#39;ve won, and honestly, I don&#39;t want you Debbie downers to win.
