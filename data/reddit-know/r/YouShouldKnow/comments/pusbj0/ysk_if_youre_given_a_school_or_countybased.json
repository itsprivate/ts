Completely locked down with browser management extensions and admin blocks. For gosh-sake sometimes I just wanna scroll Reddit or watch Twitch when there&#39;s nothing else going on. And for those of you who a school Chromebook is the only access you have to internet, you&#39;re going to want to take a break and relax sometimes. Without further delay, here&#39;s how to bypass website blocks on school Chromebooks on which website &quot;security&quot; is managed by extensions</p>\n\n<p>1: Google search the website you want to visit. Don&#39;t click the link yet.</p>\n\n<p>2: In the top right corner you should see three vertical dots. Click that</p>\n\n<p>3: Head over to more tools and click task manager</p>\n\n<p>4: End the processes associated with your Chromebook&#39;s &quot;security&quot; (e.g. cisco umbrella extension) </p>\n\n<p>5: After that, quickly click the website you want to visit. Do this fast as the &quot;security&quot; processes reinstate themselves and you may have to spam &#39;end process&#39; multiple times for the request to go through. Refresh the page and end &quot;security&quot; extensions as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Once the website loads in, you should not have to spam close the &quot;security&quot; extensions, and most of the website features should run as normal. You should also be able to visit those websites in the future without having to complete the process above. The only exception Ive seen where consistent buffering occurs is crunchyroll and the Reddit media player.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps some people :D</p>\n\n<p>Edit: This solution only works if your school didn&#39;t block task manager. If they did, you gotta resort to a dual boot process off an external drive if your processor supports windows/linux</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t exactly know the process, but I&#39;m sure you could find a youtube video that shows you how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>AMD and Intel processors support both Windows 10 and some versions of Linux.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"/u/enderwiggin42\">u/enderwiggin42</a> for the info!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
