This only covers damage you cause to another party - bodily injury, property damage, etc.   Whatever damage you incur on the job - even if it was 100% the other guy's fault - has to come out of your own pocket.  As far as you are concerned, you are uninsured in that moment.\n\n  *((Just came back to make an edit.  The liability insurance policy is going to vary between what company you use - Postmates is going to differ from Grubhub which will differ from Doordash))*\n\nSo even though you have to provide some proof of insurance in order to sign up for these apps, that is not because they want to see that you have coverage while you're driving FOR them.  \n\nSome insurance companies have what's called \"Rideshare gap.\" What this means is that you have coverage for when you are waiting for an order.  Once you have an order, and have the delivery items in your possession, the app's insurance kicks in (again, this only covers other people).  This means you have insurance coverage during the \"gap\" between orders, but you, personally, have ZERO coverage during an active delivery.  If you choose Rideshare Gap as an add-on to your policy, it's another $5-15 a month, which is basically a \"better than nothing\" option, but not the best.\n\nSome people have found that their insurance company didn't provide any kind of coverage, and as a result they had to change insurance providers.  In some cases, they have been involved in an accident and decided to omit the fact that their app was on.  \n\nBut this omission is insurance fraud.   Many car insurance companies will actually contact these  delivery apps, and if they find out that you were signed in to the app during the accident - even if it was a straight up hit and run that you caught on camera - they will not cover you.  Moreover, you may be hit with a felony insurance fraud charge, as you did not disclose that you were working during the accident.\n\nThing is, both your insurance company, AND the delivery app you work for, have your social security number, they have your license plate, they have a lot of the some personal information about you.  You might as well not lie.\n\n**Moral of the story**:  if you use any rideshare or delivery apps, make sure you are covered with some sort of Rideshare policy.  If you are not covered, DON'T LIE if you are in an accident.  Just eat the cost and learn whatever lesson you need to learn.  At that point, you're better off learning the lesson of a totaled car, than learning the lesson of felony insurance fraud charges.",
