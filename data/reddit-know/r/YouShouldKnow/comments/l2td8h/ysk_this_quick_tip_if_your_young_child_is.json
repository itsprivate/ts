I asked what part she was confused by and she said that 5 is an odd number, so she didn’t understand how it could be divided equally.\n\n“Oh!” I replied. “Now I understand your confusion. Don’t think of the denominator as being an even or odd number, because that’s not what fractions are talking about. Imagine you and 4 friends want to split a bag of M&Ms. You get 5 cups and then slowly pour the same amount into each of those 5 cups. Each of those cups has the same amount, so you have 5 equal parts.“\n\n”Oh!” she exclaimed. “That makes so much more sense!“\n\n”Right?” I said. “Now, if you have a total of 5 equal cups and you give 2 of them to 2 of your friends, how many did you give away?“\n\n”I gave away 2.“\n\n”Yes, but how many did you give away in fractions?“\n\n”I gave 2 of the 5, so 2 of the fifths. 2 fifths.“\n\n”Yes! And if you gave 2 away, how many do you have left, in fractions?“\n\n”I have 3 fifths left.“\n\n”Yes! And 2 + 3 = what?“\n\n”5.“\n\n”Correct. And 5 over 5 is what?“\n\n”All 5 of them together is 1 whole.“\n\n”Bingo! You know how to do fractions now.“\n\nShe was elated and knocked out her basic fractions schoolwork without any problems.\n\n**Why YSK: The child might be confusing even/odd numbers with equal parts of something.**",
