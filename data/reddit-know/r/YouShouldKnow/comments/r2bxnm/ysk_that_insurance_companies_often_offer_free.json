If you fall into this category (or currently have an overpriced gym membership) check with your health insurance provider to see if they offer any gym membership deals BEFORE signing up for any gym. Insurance companies know that they will likely save money long term having customers who are in better shape and thus often have deals on gym memberships. Personally, my insurance offers a program that costs me $25/m and in return I receive a nationwide membership to Planet Fitness, anytime fitness, LA fitness, Snap, Crunch, and a ton of other small and local gyms, or I may choose one single gym for free. Personally, I chose the $25/m program and in total, I get access to over 11k fitness facilities nationwide, which is great for when I travel or go on vacation and still wish to get to the gym. It would cost me hundreds of dollars a month to have the same access. My insurance is certainly not the only one. Some companies may not offer as good as options but are normally still cheaper than going through the gym directly. I know not everyone has health insurance and that’s not a discussion I wish to get into, but for those who do and wish to get a gym membership, definitely check with your provider first.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: it is almost always cheaper to go through your insurance company (if they offer memberships) for your gym membership than to go through the gym directly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
