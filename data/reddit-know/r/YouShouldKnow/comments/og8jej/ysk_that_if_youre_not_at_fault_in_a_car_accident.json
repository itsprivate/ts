If you are involved in an accident through no fault of your own, you can file a diminished value claim with the at-fault party’s insurance company and receive a settlement for the loss of value of your vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>A month ago, a drunk driver rear ended my 2020 Nissan Rogue with over $8,200 worth of damage. The insurance company of the at-fault party quickly repaired the car with no issues and my adjuster was very friendly. I thought everything went well. </p>\n\n<p>But then  a friend of mine suggested to me to get something called Diminished Value. I had no clue such a thing exists. He recommended an independent appraiser to prove my amount of DV. The appraiser gave me a free estimate for DV and it was  $4350! Wow, and I had no clue I was owed this money. I bought myself an appraisal and sent it to the insurance company. </p>\n\n<p>A few emails back and forth  and we settled for $3,700. I know they probably screwed me out of $700 but I see this as a huge win as I had no idea about this money at all. A week later I got the check in the mail!</p>\n\n<p>HERE ARE THE STEPS:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get an independent diminished value appraisal.</li>\n<li>Go to the insurance company of the person who hit your car. </li>\n<li>If they agree that the other driver is at fault, file for a diminished value claim. </li>\n<li>Accept or Decline their offer.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
