And if you are outside that range there&#39;s 7 billion people and the world and someone will have a preference for yours. And guess what people with average or smaller penises? Guys with huge dicks feel insecure sometimes too because they occasionally hurt people due to their size.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it isn&#39;t even about the penis, they may just want you to be able to know a variety of knots, choke them, etc. Being a part of someone&#39;s fetish can be much more important than what the length of your penis is.</p>\n\n<p>Also don&#39;t forget skill and confidence. Someone  could have a general preference for larger penises but may prefer a confident 5.5 incher who is skilled over someone who is 7 inches but unconfident or unskilled.</p>\n\n<p>The question does size matter isn&#39;t a universal yes or no, it varries from person to person and you can only find out one way, and if they are rude or humiliating about it they are immature and you should find someone else anyways (unless you&#39;re into that)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
