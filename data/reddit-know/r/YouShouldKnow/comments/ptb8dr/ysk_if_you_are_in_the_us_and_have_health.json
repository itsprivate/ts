That might be something that&#39;s controllable by your employer - not the insurer.</li>\n<li>Your buddy went in for XYZ procedure and his was fully paid for by ABC Insurance?  If you also have an ABC Insurance card, even if you had the same procedure done on the exact same day from the exact same provider, yours might NOT be paid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And we all wonder why the U.S. Healthcare system needs an overhaul...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
