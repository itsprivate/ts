Pro tip at the end. </p>\n\n<p>You, well most of you, have 2 eyes. Your camera only has one. What we see in the mirror is a 3-dimensional object, what we see on a photo is 2 dimensional. Your eyes are not centered, because of this you slightly see around an object, which gives a more honest view of something. A camera can only see a flat surface. </p>\n\n<p>What you see in the mirror is how other people see you, a photo is more like an approximation of your appearance. </p>\n\n<p>Also, we are not used to seeing ourselves flipped horizontally like on a photo. Your face is not perfectly symmetrical, so when you see a photo of yourself, all the asymmetrical features of your face immediately catch your attention, because you&#39;re not used to seeing them in that place. Pro tip: Try flipping your pictures horizontally, you&#39;ll be way more comfortable with what you see.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
