When you are about to fight someone, you may not be thinking of your jaw but it should be taken very seriously. </p>\n\n<p>Not clenching your jaw can lead to several bad things to occur. For one, if the other person lands a good hit, you can have a hard time breaching or even worse, break some teeth in the process. Secondly, have you heard the term “spin his jaw”... Well that’s the whole point. When you punch someone in the jaw who does not have a firm clench, you can likely KO the person or stun them very temporarily. It’s enough for them to land many more punches to your face. The last thing you want in a fight is to get knocked out. </p>\n\n<p>Your don’t have to clench as hard as you can, just have a firm clench.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: People engage for the dumbest reasons and I am very much against that. I meant this post in a way where someone is engaging you and the only move is defensive. Of course, I only hope that you are able to avoid fighting at all costs and not have to fight but I hope people know this info in the worst case scenario.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
