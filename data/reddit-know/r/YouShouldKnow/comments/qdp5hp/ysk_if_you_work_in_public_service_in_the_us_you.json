Since you can get credits for payments as far back as October 2007, this could potentially eliminate your debt or get you significantly closer to forgiveness. You can find out more information, how to apply, and if you would qualify at <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/pslf-limited-waiver\">https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/pslf-limited-waiver</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you a public service worker?</strong>\nIf you are employed by any federal government agency full time, you count as a public service worker. But that&#39;s not all! You are also considered one if you work full time for a state government, local government, tribal government, the US military, or a not-for-profit organization. You also may qualify if you work in education, public health, law enforcement, emergency management, elder or disability care, or at a library. The website linked above provides more specific information.</p>\n\n<p>I do not work for the federal government or in finance or with student loans, so I cannot provide advice or any guarantees. I just figured I should share this because I literally found out about this yesterday, the deadline is October 31st, and the form was easy to complete and submit, at least in my case. Hope this helps someone in these rough times.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
