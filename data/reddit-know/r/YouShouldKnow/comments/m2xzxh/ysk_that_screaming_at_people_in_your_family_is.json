They don't know that, for a lot of people who grew up with healthier family dynamics, it's not normal to be screamed at and can feel very scary. Screaming at someone angrily isn't necessarily abuse, but habitually screaming at someone to scare or upset them or to 'get your way', especially when also insulting them or cursing at them, is considered abusive. You'd be surprised how many people do not know this and think screaming is normal!",
