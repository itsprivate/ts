You will need it to manage people and lead teams in the future.\n\nA decade of Public speaking to crowds up to 1000 people has taught me alot about myself and Public speaking. Here are some the points to help you.\n\n-Do your prep, know your material.\n\n-Do your rehearsal without notes.\n\n-Butterflys/anxiety:\n\nIf you have butterflys, üëçgood. That feeling is great, it focuses you, adrenaline is preparing for a fight/flight. I do not feel that anymore so I actually take an energy drink immediately before an important class/presentation to simulate that hyperness (not reccomended for you), just embrace this feeling it benefits you and you will miss it.\n\n-Getting sweaty/sick:\n\nIf you feel nervous think about the guy in the back playing candy crush, why would you be afraid of him? He's a jerk, not listening, but also not judging, just and oxygen thief.  The opposite is true as well, someone taking notes and making eye contact with you wants to hear what you have to say next and is supporting you!\n\n-The group you are speaking to is far smaller than you realize:\n\nWhen you get better you can command the room and have most people's attention for small spans. You cannot have everyone's attention for 20-30 minutes, people are just not wired that way. \n\nGenerally half of the audience isn't listening, a good portion of the audience lack the mental capacity or self confidence to be judging you and listening to you at the same time.  The attentive ones you are able to make eye contact with are engaged and rooting for you, because they want to hear what's next.\n\nIf this is some type of public speaking class where everybody is taking turns, 75% of the class you are speaking to has knots in their stomach about their own presentation and are reciting their nore cards in their head. The teacher, is a Saint and superhuman if you think they can focus on every word of 25 consecutive presentations about what someone did over summer vacation.\n\n-The person judging you most harshly is you.\n\n-You are going to crush it!",
