The first time it happened I was taken off guard, but no one was behind the car that randomly decided to yield so it was ultimately fine. The second time on the other hand, multiple cars had to slam on their brakes to accommodate for the driver who randomly decided to stop in the middle of the road to let me turn. Now if I was edging out into the road, looking like I was going to dart in front of the incoming traffic, I could understand why people might slow down or even yield just to be safe, but on both occasions I was at a full stop and not in the main road at all.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, I know you&#39;re trying to be polite but you&#39;re just making the road more dangerous for other drivers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
