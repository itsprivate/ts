Most credit card companies allow children over the age of 13 to be added, some have no age limit.\n\nYou don't actually need to give them access to your credit to help them build their history. But once they're old enough to understand the basic concept of how credit works, you can allow them to use their own card but set a limit on how much they can spend. You'll also be able to track what and where they spend the money given to them, something you wouldn't be able to do if they were given cash. It can be a backup plan if they are stranded somewhere without cash. Money they spend also counts towards your credit card rewards. \n\nThere are risks to be aware of. If you do give them a card to use, they may lose the card. So it's up to you to determine when they are responsible enough for their own card. Your bad credit will affect their credit so make sure you are in a good position financially before adding an authorized user. If your card doesn't have the option to set a limit for them, they have access to your entire line of credit and you are solely responsible for paying. This could also raise your total utilization and temporarily lower your score. There may be fees for adding an authorized user.\n\nOverall it's a great way to help your children understand credit and get a head start on an excellent credit history.",
