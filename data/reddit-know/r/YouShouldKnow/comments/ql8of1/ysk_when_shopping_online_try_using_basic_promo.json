Just find the best promo code on the wheel and use it at checkout without spinning. </p>\n\n<p>You can also use the same promo codes but just change the number for a bigger discount. So if the promo code works as &quot;20OFF&quot;, you should try &quot;30OFF&quot; and if it works, keep going until it doesn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>These promo codes are often never deactivated just because they are forgotten about, so it can be useful to try ones like &quot;SUMMER21&quot; even in the fall or winter.</p>\n\n<p>You can also try to get creative with the websites that may have promo codes as tests.
