MOST pharmacies in the US have in house discount cards that can save you a huge amount of money if you don&#39;t have insurance but you have to ASK the tech to apply it.  GoodRX and WellRX provide the lowest cash price in your area but it&#39;s always worth it to see if they have an additional discount card you can use as well.  For example, cash prices for my meds at Walmart is $36 and at HEB it is $18.65.  After asking about the additional discount card, my total was $11.65.  It would have been a waste of almost $25 for me to purchase them from WalMart and I saved an additional $7 off the list price at HEB just by asking a simple question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
