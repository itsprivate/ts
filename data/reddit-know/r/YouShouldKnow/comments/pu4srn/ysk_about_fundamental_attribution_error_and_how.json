One of the worst instances of this is victim blaming. </p>\n\n<p>Another example might be: Someone else who runs a red light must be reckless and stupid. If you were to run a red light, you justify the behaviour because you know your family member is having a medical emergency and you are rushing to the hospital. </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: YSK about Fundamental Attribution Error because being mindful of it can give you a more positive outlook on life. We shouldn’t always assume the worst of others and should instead wonder what factors have put them in that situation or what else is contributing them to behave that way. Most people aren’t intentionally being malicious. People aren’t always as bad as we make them out to be.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html\">https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
