So if you receive a call from an unknown phone number which sounds like it <em>might</em> be a recorded advertisement, then turn the tables on them by intentionally providing an unconventional response. Even if the computer on the other end doesn&#39;t bail, it&#39;ll still reveal itself as such pretty quickly, giving you the opportunity to disconnect from an obvious unsolicited phone advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>An example: I just received a call which started out with, &quot;Hello! My name is Andrew -- how are you?&quot; No identifying company, no identifying purpose... just those words and nothing else. Of course, that&#39;s not the way a legit phone solicitor starts a conversation, so I already suspected that it was a recording. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, I responded by directly asking, &quot;Is this a recording?&quot; My confirmation came in the form of a very brief clip of the first word that the recording was going to say next, which was abruptly interrupted by a line disconnection.</p>\n\n<p>So either I confused it enough to force a bail-out, or (more likely in my mind) my question was flagged as the type of thing that &quot;non-spenders&quot; tend to say, triggering the bail-out. Either way, I didn&#39;t have to waste my time listening to the rest of their ad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
