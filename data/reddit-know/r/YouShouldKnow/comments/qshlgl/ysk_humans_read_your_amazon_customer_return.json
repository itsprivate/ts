It isn&#39;t feasible to open every item, so the more descriptive your return reasons are the better. Example: Some return items will be a shelf, a desk, a light fixture, etc. and the reason is the item didn&#39;t fit where they needed it to. However, they say the item is defective or doesn&#39;t work. So... it just didn&#39;t work for you? Or is there something really wrong with it?</p>\n\n<p>It also breaks up the monotony of doing this job day after day. Hell, just say hi. Or be angry about it. I know nothing about you. Tell me how rough your life is going. Tell me you didn&#39;t approve the purchase, your bratty little kid did it. And if you&#39;re sending back diapers or pet items, please don&#39;t just put no longer needed. It makes me think the worst case scenario. I want to know if the baby got to big or the pet hates their bed. I don&#39;t need to know any of that, it&#39;s just for my peace of mind. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
