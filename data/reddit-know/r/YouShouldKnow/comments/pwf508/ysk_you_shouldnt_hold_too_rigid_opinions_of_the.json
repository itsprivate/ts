This creates a thesaurus of “common knowledge”. The problem with “common knowledge” passed down from generations is that it is often filled with misconceptions and misunderstandings. </p>\n\n<p>This is the outcome of multiple people with varying degrees of understanding and experiences providing a take, and you as a receiver only have a partial point of view of that information, and of the person disseminating it, so it is difficult for you to understand that person’s biases.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, people tend to coalesce to communities of similar thoughts and behaviour. This is called “intellectual inbreeding”, where ideas are rehashed amongst a community and over time get perverted because the community doesn’t get exposed to new information or someone willing to provide counter arguments. This is such a major problem in science that top universities often don’t accept their own graduates (PhD or not) in positions and look for candidates from other universities, though exceptions exist. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, due to the brain’s plasticity, disseminating the same ideas as our group reinforces those ideas and causes them to become very rigid and fundamental parts of our world model.</p>\n\n<p>When we have a very rigid world view and we encounter a person who subscribes to fundamentally different ideas, our world view gets shaken exactly because it is very rigid, and we become unable to accept the new ideas regardless of correctness because our brain interprets the new information as an attack to itself and reality. This “attach”  physically manifests as narrow-mindedness in the brain and prevents us from accepting them.</p>\n\n<p>What can you do about it?</p>\n\n<p>Cultivate a process in your brain that keeps challenging the status quo and actively and honestly tries to find mistakes in it. Read books/listen to podcasts, and have discussions with people of opposing views.</p>\n\n<p>Keep asking, what if I am wrong, why do I have this belief, and suppose a malevolent person disseminated this idea, what could they gain from it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
