It could be your family, roommate, boyfriend or literally anyone. If you feel like you have to walk on eggshells every time that person is around, it&#39;s literally affecting your health. </p>\n\n<p>I read about this guy who used to have migraines multiple times in a weak when he was living with his toxic parents. He changed diets, doctors, did everything he could to get rid of them, nothing helped. When he moved to another city and lived alone, he had just one migraine in 7 months. Crazy to think how our environment affects us. Leave anyone like that, walking on eggshells is no way to live. Living with toxic people can literally kill you. Take care of your health, both physical and mental.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- Thanks for the awards. Some comments here are heartbreaking and I wish you all good health and peace 💚🤍</p>\n\n<p>For those asking for any sources: Read the book THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE. Infact, I&#39;d suggest this book to everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
