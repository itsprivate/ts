  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: with the obesity epidemic and Keto craze happening in the US, Xylitol use has been on the rise, significantly. It is safe for humans (but will cause diarrhea in large amounts) but CAN kill your dog very quickly unless taken to the vet IMMEDIATELY. When 5mg per 1lb of body weight is ingested, it quickly causes liver failure followed by death and the effects will begin 10-15 minutes after ingesting. Any amount less than this can cause liver cirrhosis, seizures from severe hypoglycemia, tremors, and coma in under an hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sweetener is found in most “sugar free” snacks, gum, toothpaste, candies, and if you know anyone who follows a Keto Diet or is just simply diabetic, they most likely have a whole bag of the stuff in their cupboard because it tastes and bakes very similar to regular sugar. It’s even in some brands of peanut butter. With the holidays going on and everyone baking sweet treats, I thought I would mention this because until my own dog ate toothpaste with Xylitol, I had NO idea it was so dangerous. She’s fine, now. Thankfully she threw the majority of it up herself. It’s extremely easy for a pup to eat this amount of Xylitol. If you bake a sugar free cake and your dog eats it off the counter while it’s cooling, or you forget to put your toothpaste in the drawer and your curious puppy eats it like puppies do… you could have your heart broken in under an hour. So please be careful! Also never give your pup a homemade treat that you didn’t make yourself!! This info is not well known at all and a good-intending person may use xylitol in place of sugar to make the treats “healthier”. So just be careful, fellow pet owners :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is some more info! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/xylitol-toxicity-in-dogs\"&gt;https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/xylitol-toxicity-in-dogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
