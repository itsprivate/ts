We have all experienced it at one point or another.</p>\n\n<p>Well, page refreshing isn&#39;t new, and that&#39;s kind of what causes what we are talking about. See, back in the days of 56k modems where you could wait for 10 mins straight for a picture to load (that&#39;s not a joke, young people, yes really) in order to save our souls, web browsers store local cached versions of the web pages.</p>\n\n<p>This is great, because it means speedy response times and whatnot, not having to load all the code on some flash cooking or gaming site every time you go there is awesome.</p>\n\n<p>However, sometimes things go wrong. Usually a refresh fixes it, but sometimes is bad data you have cached that&#39;s always going to cause a problem. Stalled video from a bad header or something.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you don&#39;t need to know any of this, really. All you need to know is you can clear that pages local cache and force your browser to load the entire thing from scratch again, by pressing Control and F5 at the same time. F5 to refresh, control+F5 for hyper ultra somethings really wrong hardmode refresh.</p>\n\n<p>It will only refresh that one page, it will remember your usernames and passwords (cookies), but the actual page data itself. Formatting, font types, menus bars, photos, sounds, all that stuff. The page data. That will all be purged and redownloaded fresh.</p>\n\n<p>This fixes many, many, internet problems, and is a great time that everyone should know!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
