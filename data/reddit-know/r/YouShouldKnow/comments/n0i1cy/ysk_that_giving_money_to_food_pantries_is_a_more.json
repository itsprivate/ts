The types of food you give may not be what is needed by the recipient families. Everybody donates cans of beans. However, did you know that baby formula is one of the most needed foods? People tend to give what's in their pantry, which just happens to be what they bought and haven't eaten.\n4. Food pantries get discounts on their purchases. They can make your dollars go farther in helping needy people.\n5. Food pantries have bills, too. They still pay rent, employees, transportation, utilities, just like any other operation. They can't deliver their services without money to pay for those. It's hard to convince the electric company to taken payment in cans of beans.\n6. Food pantries often do much more than provide food.
