Things like diatomaceous earth or natural repellents like lemon oil, eucalyptus oil, etc. are preferable. You can search for &#39;natural pest control&#39; depending on what you&#39;re trying to keep away. </p>\n\n<p>Pesticides can very easily enter the environment. You spray some ants or roaches, something like a lizard or a bird eats the dying or dead bug, gets sick itself and dies. Then maybe something like a hawk or a coyote eats the dead bird and also gets ill. This is a bigger problem with agriculture than home defense, but it&#39;s still an issue. In agriculture, many farms use pesticides on literally everything, all the time. Seeds are sprayed with pesticides and throughout the plants&#39; lifespan. </p>\n\n<p>Again, pesticides should be used as a last resort, but your mileage may vary. Having an exterminator come by once a month is probably excessive unless your problem is extremely serious. There&#39;s nothing wrong with using pesticides when necessary, but if you want them to be the most effective, it&#39;s important to limit their use and switch up chemical classes when applying them.</p>\n\n<p>Some sources:\n<a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/grapes/integrated_pest_management/how-pesticide-resistance-develops\">https://www.canr.msu.edu/grapes/integrated_pest_management/how-pesticide-resistance-develops</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/natural-pesticide-tips\">https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/natural-pesticide-tips</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-growing-problem-of-pesticide-resistance/4013465.article\">https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-growing-problem-of-pesticide-resistance/4013465.article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
