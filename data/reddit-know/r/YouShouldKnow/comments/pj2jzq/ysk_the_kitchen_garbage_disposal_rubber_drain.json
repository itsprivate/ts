  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>WHY YSK: The underside of the garage disposal rubber flap that is at the entrance to the blades in a garbage disposal, periodically needs cleaned with bleach or other disinfectant solution due to build up of food and/or mold growing. I realized this today when I decided to clean mine. I&#39;ll never let this go uncleaned again. Maybe twice a month will be adequate. I&#39;ll have to see before I decide how often it&#39;s needed.</p>\n\n<p>How To: Unplug disposal, have a bowl or separate sink with hot sudsy solution. Use a bottle brush and after dipping brush into cleaning solution, push brush into disposal opening and bring brush head back up to scrub inside of the rubber flap. Rinse brush in clean water. Continue cleaning with cleaning solution and brush until the brush comes up clean. Rinse disposal with the remaining cleaning solution, and hot water, and after plugging disposal back in again, you can  even run ice and lemon peel through disposal while on, to finish the job.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
