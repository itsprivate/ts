Like a fragrance but wish it lasted longer? Check if it’s an EDT, and if so, see if it has an EDP! That being said, sometimes an EDT and an EDP can actually have different scent notes, so keep in mind they may not smell the same! Typically speaking though, it’s unlikely you’ll run across true cologne in your general shopping.</p>\n\n<p>Concentration strengths go from least to most concentrated: Eau Fraiche, Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum, Parfum.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
