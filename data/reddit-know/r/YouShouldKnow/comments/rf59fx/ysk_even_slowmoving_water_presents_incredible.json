Imagine the water as 1 ton cubes moving at that speed, and you will see how cars get swept away trying to cross.",

I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your car absolutely will not win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
