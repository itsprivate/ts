Because like everyone else I too hate to click on a video without knowing the like to dislike ratio and watse my time on clickbait videos. But there is hope open open source projects like <a href=\"https://freetubeapp.io\">Freetube</a> and <a href=\"https://newpipe.net\">Newpipe</a> still shows dislike on videos. While you can&#39;t like, dislike, or comment on videos you can freely watch any videos without being tracked by YouTube app or Google. On behalf of the open source community I highly recommend you download both freetube and newpipe and support the projects anyone way you can.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
