  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: Opioid overdoses kit [100,000 Americans per year]. If given early enough, Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and restore normal breathing. It works by turning off opioid receptors in the brain, meaning it has no effects on someone who isn&amp;#39;t being affected by opioids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my home state of Minnesota, most pharmacies give it out for free. No special training is required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that it is a controlled substance, so you will need a prescription in some states. More info below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How Does Naloxone Work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist meaning it binds to opioid receptors and reverses or blocks the effects of other opioids. Giving naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal respiration. It can be administered by injection or through a nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is Naloxone Safe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. There is no evidence of significant adverse reactions to naloxone. Administering naloxone in cases of opioid overdose can cause withdrawal symptoms when the person is dependent on opioids; this is uncomfortable without being life threatening. The risk that someone overdosing on opioids will have a serious adverse reaction to naloxone is far less than their risk of dying from overdose. Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is suspected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/naloxone-opioid-overdose-life-saving-science\"&gt;Source - drugabuse.gov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional Sources:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preventionsolutions.edc.org/services/resources/state-naloxone-access-laws\"&gt;State Naloxone Access Laws - Education Development Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://doseofreality.mn.gov/need-help/naloxone.asp\"&gt;General information on Naloxone - doseofreality.mn.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
