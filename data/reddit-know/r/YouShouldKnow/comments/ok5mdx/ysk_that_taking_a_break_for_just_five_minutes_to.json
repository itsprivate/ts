When you&#39;re breathing in, picture the air going down into your stomach and filling it. Don&#39;t force anything, don&#39;t rush it, let it happen easily.</p>\n\n<p>Keep the breath in your stomach for up to a 5 count if you can - if you can&#39;t, go with whatever you&#39;re able to. </p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;ve reached your chosen count, let the breath flow easily from your mouth. I personally love letting out an audible sigh when I do. It just feels good.</p>\n\n<p>As you pictured your stomach filling, now you picture your stomach deflating with your breath. </p>\n\n<p>Once you&#39;ve completed breathing out, repeat at step one by breathing deeply through your nose (if you&#39;re able to).</p>\n\n<p>Repeat this process for 3 - 5 minutes. </p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;ve fully finished this exercise, take stock of how you&#39;re feeling again. </p>\n\n<p>You should notice a tangible difference between how you&#39;re feeling now to how you felt then.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
