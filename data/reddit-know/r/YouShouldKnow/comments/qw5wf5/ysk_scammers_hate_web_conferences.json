This might be timeshare scams or other phony &quot;too good to be true&quot; deals. If they are legitimate professionals, they will have no problems doing so, but if they are scammers or criminals, they find some reason to not converse that way. They will provide any reason they can think of to avoid any potential records of their face. This might save you hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: to add I don&#39;t mean normal spam calls. I mean like, job searches, or real estate sale offers, etc. Of course we just hang up on Steven trying to tell you that you won the lottery, or that you need more insurance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
