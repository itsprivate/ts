Put the thumb of your fist against your stomach, below your ribs and above your belly button. Grab your fist firmly with the other hand and jam it AS HARD AS YOU CAN up and under your ribcage with a fast punching movement. You&#39;re literally trying to suckerpunch yourself. It doesn&#39;t matter if it hurts. If it works you&#39;ll have plenty of time to complain. If it doesn&#39;t, it won&#39;t bother you for long. So lean into it.</p>\n\n<p>If this doesn&#39;t work within fifteen seconds (or your arm gets too tired). Stand up, open your car door, and lean over your car door. Same idea (this is commonly done with a chair), quick thrusts until the object clears from your throat.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people are taught the chair technique, but almost nobody knows that you can use a car door with the same training and results.</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe out there kids.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
