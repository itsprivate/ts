My family and I recently started going to the public library, and found out many unknown things about it. On top of renting books you can rent movies on DVD and Blu-Ray, use the computers for internet access, 3D print things for a tiny fee, rent video games (and I mean new ones for switch and xbox series S/X on top of oldies like Xbox 360 and Xbox One and Ps4.) You can play with toys which is great for our 4 y/o daughter. We can even rent american girl dolls which is amazing for tight budgets. We can rent audio books on an app called Libby or even physical audio books. You can use the website for the library to search for specific things and they&#39;ll ship from other libraries to yours. I assume all or most public libraries are like this. You should really know about this and all the FREE things you can do and rent. Once again, the library is amazing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
