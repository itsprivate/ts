If a red light comes on, stop immediately. Things like no oil pressure, overheating, or brake failure, or charging system failure.</p>\n\n<p>Charging system failure may sound like that should be an amber light, but there&#39;s a good reason it&#39;s red. It&#39;s rare for an alternator to just die all of a sudden, so that could also indicate a broken serpentine belt, which would also stop your water pump and power steering pump. It could also indicate an electrical fault that could, in serious cases, start a fire. Even if it&#39;s neither of those, when your battery dies, you are stranded. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s red.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK:  If you don&#39;t know what all the lights in your car mean, just knowing what the color means can save you a lot of money and avoid dangerous situations.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
