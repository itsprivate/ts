The difference in color is due to the fact that if the bleeding happens higher up the blood gets digested before ending up in your poop, getting a very peculiar blackish color, a jelly like consistency and a very strong horrible smell, while in rectal bleeding the blood wont have the time to be digested and will stay a vivid red, mostly liquid and won&#39;t smell that strongly.</p>\n\n<p>In both these cases, if you know you are actively pooping blood, you should immediately go to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>GI (gastrointestinal) bleedings can be very dangerous on their own, and can also be strong indicators of other illnesses, such as Crohn disease, diverticulitis and intestinal cancer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm#what_does_it_mean_when_your_stool_color_changes_in_color_texture_or_form\">A nice read about this topic.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
