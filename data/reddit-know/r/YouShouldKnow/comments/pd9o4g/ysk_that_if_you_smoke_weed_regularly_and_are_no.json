(<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/43/Supplement_1/A62/5846891\">Source 1</a>, <a href=\"https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpt1976196782\">Source 2</a>) if you are still having vivid dreams every day, then congratulations, your REM sleep is probably fine.</p>\n\n<p>The reason this is important is because the lack of REM sleep is associated with decreased learning ability and decreased memory consolidation. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217313295\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>It has also been studied that cannabis use among REM-sleep deprived rats shows that they become more aggressive. (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426483\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>You might be able to circumvent this to some extent if you go to bed completely sober, but I&#39;m not sure if doing that allows for full REM cycles again.</p>\n\n<p>In summary: Smoking delta-9 THC (weed), especially before bed, can reduce your time in REM sleep. This causes you to have worse memory, and makes it harder to learn new things and new habits. This is stuff that weed by itself already makes harder for a lot of people, so it&#39;s even worse when combined with lack of REM sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: by the way, this isn&#39;t to say that you should never smoke weed before bed or for nightmares or anything like that. I&#39;m just trying to inform more people because I&#39;ve been experiencing REM-sleep deprivation for years now and had no idea until now that it had any effects other than just blocking dreams. And now that I&#39;ve been trying to dream more I feel like I am getting more restful sleep.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
