Especially if your vehicle is newer, there may not be many comparables in the area to give an accurate representation of what your vehicle is worth.  When this happens they find other vehicles of the same model with potential much higher miles, or using the \"fleet model\" of your vehicle.\n\nIn my case, I was not at fault in any capacity [(Gif from my dashcam)](https://makeagif.com/gif/dashcam-eUhf8L) and when I got the valuation back I immediately recognized it as low because my friend had just sold the same truck weeks before.  I asked for the report which lists vehicles that were deemed comparable to mine.  After combing through the vin numbers of the vehicles that were supposed to be comparable, I found that many were fleet model vehicles for construction, you know the ones with manual windows.  Additionally many had significantly more miles than mine, one of which had more than 3x the mileage as my vehicle.  The difference between what they were evaluating my truck at, and what it was actually selling for was in the neighborhood of $6000.  In the report if the trim level doesn't match, they pretend to account for that by adding a little to the comparable price, but it is less than 30% of what the difference actually should be.\n\nWhat I found odd was that when the vehicle didn't match my trim level, it always skewed downwards and never upwards.  The same with factory installed options, if the vehicle didn't have the same options as mine, it always had less.  It would seem that statistically, if there weren't enough vehicles just like mine then there would be some listed that were cheaper and some that were more expensive which would eventually balance out.  For some reason though, every single one skewed downwards.\n\nLuckily I happened to know what my vehicle was selling so I was able to catch it, but I thought of how many people had been taken advantage of because they just trusted that the insurance valuation was correct and honest.\n\nGet the report, and compare the vins listed against what your vehicle is and what vehicles like yours are actually selling for.",
