As the story goes: If they sink they are safe, if they float they are spoiled. This is dishonest at best.\n\nEggshells are porous, and over time part of the eggs becomes filled with gas. So yes, checking if the eggs float or not definitely will tell you something about how old they are. However, eggs that sink can definitely be spoiled, and your floating egg is most likely fine and completely safe to eat.\n\nIn fact, in some cases eggs can last up to 6 months!\n\nBefore I go on a short rant about eggs: If you want to check whether or not an egg is spoiled, crack the egg into an empty bowl. If it is bad, you will smell it quick. Eggs with a bacteria like salmonella growing in them have a strong rancid smell.\n\nWhen eggs are fresh, they contain a natural protecting seal called the “bloom” which keeps anything from going in or out of the egg. This natural shield works so well that farm fresh eggs can be left in a bowl on the kitchen counter for 6 months before they start to spoil (long after they have become buoyant in water). Once the eggs have been washed with soap and water, the bloom is gone, and they will only last a few weeks if left out of the fridge.\n\nIf you live in North America, you most likely buy your eggs refrigerated in the super market, as opposed to most of the world which does not refrigerate their eggs. Basically this is due to the living conditions for the laying hens in factory farms being so pour, salmonella became rampant in the North American chicken population, and then of course would pass on to the consumer. To help prevent people from catching salmonella they started washing an refrigerating eggs.\n\nI have heard this myth all of my life. Personally I have had a little hobby farm of laying hens and roosters for about 5 years, so it bothers me more and more to know that there are chickens living crappy lives in factory farms only for their perfectly good eggs to get tossed!\n\n**Why YSK:** If you buy your eggs at your average grocery store, well, some chickens lived through hell in order to make you those eggs. Sure, wanting to be animal friendly, you might buy the eggs that say something like “cage free” or “free range”. Unfortunately cage free simply means that all of the hens are shoved together in the same room rather than individual cages, and they still likely have barely any room to walk around. It depends on the regulations where you live, but generally to be able to label eggs ‘free range’, the farmer needs to let the chicken outside at one point during its life. So make sure to eat all your perfectly safe, delicious, buoyant eggs before you buy more!\n\nBetter yet, try to buy your eggs from a local farmer or a neighbour with a hobby farm. Natural farm eggs from happy hens are like a whole new food. They taste amazing and once you try them, you will never buy eggs from the supermarket again.",
