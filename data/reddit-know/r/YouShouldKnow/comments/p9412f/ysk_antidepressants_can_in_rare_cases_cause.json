They can also have long-lasting side effects, so don&#39;t freak out if you have had effects for months after stopping, because they could still go away. But do see a urologist or endocrinologist, or other specialized doctor, who you know knows about PSSD. That way they can help figure out what is wrong with you and what the next steps are. </p>\n\n<p>Also, YSK: that doctors and psychiatrists are specialists in their own field. Most psychiatrists do <em>not</em> specialize in therapy. What this means is there may be therapy options for your disorder which you may be unaware of. For instance many psychiatrists (as opposed to psychologists) will prescribe SSRIs for OCD, and not ask whether the patient is doing exposure therapy (which is the golden standard for OCD treatment). This is to no fault of their own; it is just outside of their speciality which is to know about <em>medication</em></p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: Talk over your different health options with a doctor or second opinion if you believe you are being prescribed medication that does not fit your needs. However NEVER stop a medication without medical supervision, that can be extremely dangerous.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rxisk.org/post-ssri-sexual-dysfunction-pssd/\">https://rxisk.org/post-ssri-sexual-dysfunction-pssd/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28778697/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28778697/</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: I realized as soon as I wrote this that I should have clarified in the title that PSSD can be both men <em>and</em> women (and all genders).
