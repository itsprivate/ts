The quantity difference might be over 50x the seeds for an extra 2 dollars. They also support local people better than your regional chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used an entire bottle of cumin and other Indian spices for 1 recipe of butter chicken totalling $10-$15 in spices. The Indian store near me sold near gallon sized bags of it for less than $10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like to cook, buy from them and then transfer extras into old glass jars for safe keeping since they don&amp;#39;t usually come in resealable bags. It&amp;#39;s a great way to save some money and try new fun products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
