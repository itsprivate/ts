Possibly resulting in a favorable refund. </p>\n\n<p>I recently traded in an suv that still had an extended maintenance warranty purchased through a major named dealer. As we were signing paperwork for the a new vehicle, I asked if there was a refund option from the traded in vehicle, the finance guy was hesitant and didn’t answer my question directly. I let it slide, until we were about to leave. </p>\n\n<p>I find the finance manager and asked the same question. And again….. was greeted with hesitation. He eventually steers me to the proper process to receive a refund, but the hinkyness to it was all to shady as they made me feel I was stealing from them. Which I wasn’t, I’m rightfully getting my money back. The dealers are pocketing an exorbitant amount of money that people have no clue about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
