A thorough or complete cheese has little or no lactose in it, so you don’t have to limit yourself necessarily. Milk is made up of two proteins; casein and whey. The whey is where the lactose is. When you make cheese, you separate the two proteins (thus you get curds and whey) using rennet (an enzyme that baby mammals naturally produce to digest milk) and keep the casein protein (that’s the cheese part). </p>\n\n<p>Some cheeses are less thorough with the rennet, like mozzarella, and have more whey. Those cheeses are less likely to be digestible for lactose intolerant people. Harder cheeses have less or no lactose because they are made with more rennet. If you are lactose intolerant, you might be able to handle these cheeses! Cheese on!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
