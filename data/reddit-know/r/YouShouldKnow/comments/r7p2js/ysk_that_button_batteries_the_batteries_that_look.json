We especially see these batteries around the holidays as they are in decorations, cards, toys and all sorts of other things. I work as a nurse and have seen several children need to be tube fed for the rest of their lives and/or have permanent vocal damage. Please keep items with button batteries up and away from toddlers and young children. And if it does happen (happens to the best parents so don&amp;#39;t freak out) get your kid to the emergency room immediately. If the x-ray shows a &amp;quot;coin with a halo&amp;quot; get your kid into surgery asap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
