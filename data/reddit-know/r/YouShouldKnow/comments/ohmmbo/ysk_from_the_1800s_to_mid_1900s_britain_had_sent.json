This would be the history of British Home Children.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, back in the 1800&#39;s Britain decided to handle it&#39;s orphan and poverty issues by shipping thousands of children off to former colonies: New Zealand, Australia, and South America, and other destinations, but mostly to Canada.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of these children had at least one parent, but because of rampant unemployment in Britain, the parent was unable to afford to look after the child and had to give them up. Children generally aged 9-14 (though could be as young as 3) were sent from Britain to shelters in their destination colony, and from there sent to live on rural properties.</p>\n\n<p>This was not adoption, but rather indentured child labor. This was treated as a way to bring needed labor to the colonies, which had shortages of farm workers. Farmers would receive a small amount of compensation for housing the child, and that child would be expected to assist with work on the farm. At 18 years of age the indentured labor would end. Essentially this was a legal form of importing child slaves.</p>\n\n<p>The arrangement worked out for some, who were treated as though they became part of the family, but for the majority it was a nightmare. With no oversight over their treatment, many wound up overworked, physically abused, sexually abused, and under-educated. Injuries and neglect led to deaths, and child/teen suicide over the conditions were known to occur as well.</p>\n\n<p>When children would &quot;cause problems&quot; or try to run away, they could be moved from farm to farm. <a href=\"https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/a-huge-injustice\">There are stories of children</a> having been moved around over a dozen times over the years while experiencing whippings, beatings, and rapes ending in stillborn births all by age 14.</p>\n\n<p>This practice primarily took place from 1869-1939, at which point it was discontinued. However it was still happening at times as late as the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p>Thousands of children were involved, including over 100,000 children being sent to Canada alone this way. In fact it is estimated that 10% of Canada&#39;s population are actually descended from the Home Children sent there.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to discover if you yourself are a descent of a British Home Child there are some ways to discover this. If you are in Canada you can use the <a href=\"https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/immigration/immigration-records/home-children-1869-1930/immigration-records/Pages/immigration-records.aspx\">Canadian Government&#39;s Home Children Records website</a>. Similar records exist for other countries, and in Australia there had been the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/%7E/link.aspx?_id=B090C3C1764F447AB704732C8A7E4A37&amp;_z=z\">Child Migrant Trust</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the late 1990&#39;s the UK conducted an inquiry into the former practice, and the result was an apology and creation of a fund meant to reunite families who had been broken apart. Sadly this has been discontinued. Australia similarly made an apology and made funds available for reuniting (also now over). Canada, however, has to this day declined to give an apology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why YSK:</strong> Additionally, the UK had agreed to pay compensation to those affected, or to their beneficiaries up to a certain date, so if you have relatives who were themselves Home Children they (or you) could be eligible for £20,000 in compensation.</p>\n\n<p>As light is being shed on the dark times in our history, and people are seeking to heal from horrific events conducted by their governments decades ago, the existence and fate of the British Home Children needs to be a part of this discussion. I hope you will look into this topic and help to spread word about it to any who may be unaware of these events, or perhaps even of their own family history.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
