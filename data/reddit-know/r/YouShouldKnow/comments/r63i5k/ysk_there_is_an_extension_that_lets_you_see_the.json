Well it&amp;#39;s helpful when you&amp;#39;re trying to sniff out a scam, or maybe it&amp;#39;s helpful when looking up instructional video&amp;#39;s or DIY stuff. It&amp;#39;s also amusing to look at youtube rewind and see how many dislikes it gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically you should know because youtube took away it&amp;#39;s functionality and this brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
