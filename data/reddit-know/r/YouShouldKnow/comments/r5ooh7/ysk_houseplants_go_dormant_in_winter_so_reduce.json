It is important to not overwater your houseplants as they can grow mold, mildew, or be susceptible to fungus and other diseases with excessive water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to touch the soil with your finger to see if the substrate is moist, and avoid watering again until it is dry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, leaf tips can go brown from cold. Do not cut these off until warmer weather arrives, as this is one of the plant’s protection against frost. They essentially write off a part of themselves to take the damage from the cold in order to protect the rest of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and happy gardening!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
