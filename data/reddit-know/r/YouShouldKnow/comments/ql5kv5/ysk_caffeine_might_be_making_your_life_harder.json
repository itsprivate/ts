However, the problem is that using drugs such as caffeine that have the ability to affect the brain, we mess up our natural brain functions. This becomes a serious issue when we consume it daily. </p>\n\n<p>By doing that, we reach a level of dependence that legitimately makes us forget how we used to operate naturally before we abused them.</p>\n\n<p>One of the worst side effects is sleep problems and that’s what I’m going to focus on in this post. </p>\n\n<p>To understand how caffeine makes us alert we need to understand how it affects adenosine.</p>\n\n<p>Adenosine is a powerful type of molecule in our bodies and the build up of adenosine causes drowsiness which makes us sleep at night. </p>\n\n<p>Caffeine on the other hand is a stimulant and it works by inhibiting adenosine receptors which helps keep us alert. </p>\n\n<p>We should keep in mind that a lot of food and drinks contain caffeine. For example, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks such as coke, chocolate, energy drinks etc…</p>\n\n<p>Moderation is key. Start by decreasing caffeine intake to a point where you can function normally without it. Then, consume it only when necessary. \nYou’ll be shocked when you realize that you can live without using it daily : )</p>\n\n<p>Oh and absolutely no caffeine at least 6 hours before bed!!!! </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>All about caffeine: \n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
