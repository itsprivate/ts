It is normal to them, even if it feels wrong & they can't put their finger on it. It is usually not until adulthood or intervention (whichever comes first) that they gain enough life experience and/or enough brain development to understand what happened to them. And even then, it takes some people half their lives. \n\nTreating kids as if they are just bratty, angsty, or \"don't understand yet\" causes immense additional damage. Never, ever tell an upset adolescent \"your ______ loves you\" because there is no possible way you could know that. They have the right to determine that on their own, and you are messing with their ability/willingness to trust their instincts. The number of parents out there who do not love their kids is astounding, and even if they do and still abuse them, you are solidifying in that human being that *this is what love feels like.*\n\nChild abuse is a RAMPANT unseen problem. It is 100x more common than the average good, non-abusive person thinks.\n\nALWAYS take children's feelings and beliefs seriously, especially about parents & relatives. In some cases, they may just be bratty kids, and if you allow them to have these feelings & thoughts without criticising or downplaying them, **there is no lasting harm done.** If they are actually experiencing abuse, not taking them seriously only gaslights them further and hurts them in a huge variety of ways.\n\nHave to mention this: While often the parent they hate or fear is the abuser, sometimes the \"good parent\" is the covert abuser. They emotionally abuse the kid, including manipulating them to \"hate\" the other parent. This can and does happen all the time, so tread lightly. Confirming this belief that was manipulated into them by the actual abuser is tragic and destructive. Again, children have a right to formulate their own opinions and beliefs based on how people treat them, including their parents. Manipulated alienation is relatively easily exposed by a trained professional, if the opportunity arises, though it can't always be solved. This scenario is a true tragedy :(",
