  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK, this time of year and even more so this year (at least in the United States as far as I know), the mail and package services are completely overwhelmed. This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can&amp;#39;t exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked &amp;quot;help yourself delivery people&amp;quot; can make a huge difference in their day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn&amp;#39;t even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it&amp;#39;s not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don&amp;#39;t, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today&amp;#39;s world we need more of that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit; if you are someone delivering please say what country/area of the country/service and what would help you whatever time of the year and any rules you have to follow to accept anything. About to go to sleep, but when I wake up sometime tomorrow I will edit again and add a list as best I can for anyone trying to set up care packages! Obviously water and snacks, but based off a comment I realized I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of cheap shake to activate hand warmers that could really be nice for someone out all day. I also know some companies have policies where &amp;quot;helping themselves&amp;quot; could be reported in today&amp;#39;s day and age so we could avoid it being a worry I&amp;#39;d like to know how! :) Have a good night/day everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
