I&#39;ve found the best settings are: custom equalizer with all frequencies cranked right up, adapt sound at 60 or over and finally Dolby atmos at &#39;auto&#39;. I&#39;m no sound engineer so it&#39;s possible these settings could be blasting my ears out right now, but trust me when I say it&#39;s made my music a million times better, especially if you&#39;ve got cheaper model headphones! </p>\n\n<p>So fiddle with some sound settings people and lemme know if it&#39;s made your music better! Maybe my headphones are just rubish to begin with lol</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: on IOS it can be found under ‘music’ in settings</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
