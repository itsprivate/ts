That responsibility will carry onto teenage and adulthood. They will know how to do different things. </p>\n\n<p>Teach them age appropriate things, don&#39;t go overboard. And make sure to give them clear instructions on what they need to do, instead of just expecting them to know it right away.</p>\n\n<p>Young children at age 4, are capable of cleaning up their toys. They can make their beds, it might not be to the parents standards, but it&#39;s still good enough.</p>\n\n<p>Some children can do extra chores like laundry and folding their clothes. Again, it might not be up to the parents standards, but they are learning.</p>\n\n<p>You can tell your children to set the dining table and move their own dishes to the sink. (Of course, depending on such things as knives, might be a no).</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the age, they can also help with the dishes, make sure they don&#39;t throw their towels or clothes on the floor. Making \nsure their shoes are at a place that they can find easily, and so on \nand so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it depends on each child, as well. So keep this all at educated level.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t scold them if they don&#39;t do up to your standards, it&#39;s good that they are learning, it will also help them bond with you, and even learn different things. The chores should not be divided against boys vs girls, they should be split up evenly.</p>\n\n<p>Once the kids are old enough they can also learn how to cook and bake. Nothing that will scald them, but just little things. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.momables.com/teach-your-kid-how-to-cook-by-age/\">https://www.momables.com/teach-your-kid-how-to-cook-by-age/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heated.medium.com/teach-your-kid-to-cook-f348fb4f62a2\">https://heated.medium.com/teach-your-kid-to-cook-f348fb4f62a2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moms.com/kids-chores-gender-neutral/\">https://www.moms.com/kids-chores-gender-neutral/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6637661\">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6637661</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://centerforparentingeducation.org/library-of-articles/responsibility-and-chores/part-i-benefits-of-chores/\">https://centerforparentingeducation.org/library-of-articles/responsibility-and-chores/part-i-benefits-of-chores/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://redtri.com/life-skills-learned-from-doing-chores/\">https://redtri.com/life-skills-learned-from-doing-chores/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/chores/the-reason-children-should-do-chores-is-because-it-is-good-for-them/#gs.96so3g\">https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/chores/the-reason-children-should-do-chores-is-because-it-is-good-for-them/#gs.96so3g</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/chores/chores-for-children\">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/chores/chores-for-children</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
