This would cause less sound, and once open, would allow more time for the bad guy/gal to peruse your property. The same goes for a lot of door locks. Many locks installed on homes have sloppy tolerances, and again, can be picked quite easily.</p>\n\n<p>For padlock replacements there are many options, e.g., an American Lock (1100 or 5200), Mako 427, M-2, Paclock (90A,90A Pro, 100, etc.) are great options for locker use, and there are other locks with more robust shackles our there, just do a bit of research. You want to make sure it&#39;s something with tight tolerances; something with security pins in each chamber and at least equipped with 5-6 pins.</p>\n\n<p>If you upgrade your physical security, be sure to keep in mind, is it worth paying x amount of money on a really good lock, if someone can easily bash in a window for quick and easy access? Most burglaries use destructive means of entry, which would render your lock pointless. But, there are people out there with the know-how, and it&#39;s always good to have.</p>\n\n<p>Research the locks you have been using and decide for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Paclock 90A--not 427</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
