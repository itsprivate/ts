These can cost less than $5, repurposing an original flash drive.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriptvQ1BHg\">Here is a short, fictional, educational episode demonstrating  how this works.</a></p>\n\n<p>Flash drives that <em>fry</em> your computer are known as &quot;USB killers&quot;. They use capacitors to charge up from the USB port, and then send the power back to &quot;tase&quot; your computer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hbuhFwFsDU\">Here is a short video demonstrating the effect.</a>. These can cost from $30 to $100.</p>\n\n<p>If you find a USB device laying around at a place of business or work, give it to your boss or sysadmin. Unknown flash drives should be  investigated on an expendable computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) in a non-networked environment. More advanced Bad USBs can come with a SIM card and cell modem built in, giving it the ability to &quot;phone home&quot; even on a non-networked computer.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: This is a very common method for cyberattacks. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\">The US hacked the Iran nuclear program just by leaving USB drives around</a>, but this attack is effective to target almost anyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
