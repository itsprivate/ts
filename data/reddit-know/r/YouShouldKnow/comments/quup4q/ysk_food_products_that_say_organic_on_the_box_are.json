For example, if you see the word &quot;chocolatey&quot; in big letters on a box of candy, but <em>not</em> chocolate - there is no chocolate in the candy.</p>\n\n<p>Right now &quot;being healthy&quot; and &quot;being green&quot; are buzz words in the food business.  Organic food is a big seller, but it&#39;s also expensive, and that cuts into the bottom line. So companies have started to advertise &quot;organic&quot; on their packaging when not all the ingredients are organic. If you see the phrase &quot;organic&quot; on a box of food, look closer - for example, on a frozen mushroom and sausage pizza, you may see something like:</p>\n\n<p><sup>made with</sup> <strong>ORGANIC</strong> <sup>mushrooms</sup></p>\n\n<p>Everything else - the tomato sauce, the sausage, cheese, etc are made from ingredients that are <em>not</em> organic, and therefore most likely worse for you -- and often times worse for the planet. It&#39;s a neat way to trick you into buying something you don&#39;t want to buy. </p>\n\n<p>Read the packaging carefully. For a fully organic product, it can&#39;t say &quot;made with organic x&quot; it needs to say &quot;organic&quot; and <em>nothing else.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
