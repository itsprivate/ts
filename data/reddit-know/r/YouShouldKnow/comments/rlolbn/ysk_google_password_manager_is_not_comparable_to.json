You should know google password manager is a browser-based manager and linked to your browser&amp;#39;s data like history/cookies/cache, so it can be cleared accidentally and easily. A third party app (lastpass, keeper, 1password, etc.) is a true password manager and much better choice. Other things to note if you&amp;#39;re new to tech-security and want to be better: Google&amp;#39;s auto-generating feature only creates relatively simple passwords and you cannot change the requirements/length. It is &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; available with chrome, while third party managers are separate entities and have apps/extensions. Being linked to google, someone would only need one password on one of your devices to access them &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did I learn this? Well, I absent-mindedly cleared my history along with all other data in the advanced settings to help try and debug an app. Next thing I know, the entirety of 2+ years of saved passwords, most of which are auto-generated, are gone! Don&amp;#39;t be like me. But if you do want to stick with google pw manager, make sure to back them up. There is an option to download a .csv file with all your passwords if you want to move them to another manager. That introduces a whole other layer of risk, so be careful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
