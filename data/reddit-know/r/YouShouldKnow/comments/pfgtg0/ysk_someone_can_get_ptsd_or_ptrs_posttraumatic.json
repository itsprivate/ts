I think its important to know this so that if it happens to someone you know or someone you care about  you can look into the issue a little more and know how to deal with it. I&#39;d never heard of this, and I probably have seen it before. This just goes to show how much good this knowledge could do if it was widespread.</p>\n\n<p>Also, don&#39;t minimize people&#39;s trauma, some friends of mine told me I was overreacting, as in I hadn&#39;t gotten over it, and they didn&#39;t know half the story. Don&#39;t think someone&#39;s trauma is just them overreacting, that mentality just makes people who are dealing with it more insecure and is just downright wrong. People have different lives, if you&#39;re strong and had a stable life then great for you, but not everyone grew up in a stable home where they always had access to food, or when their parents weren&#39;t divorcing, or they were being bullied.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
