I had been wanting to see a dietician for years but I was held back by some fears. I had a preconceived notion that the dietician would simply express disappointment in my eating habits and then force me into a diet I wasn’t interested in. However, my experience has been the complete opposite. The dietician I see has been teaching me skills to improve my eating psychologically through things like intuitive eating skills, and not once has she ever made a comment that anything I eat is bad. In fact, she has actually been counseling me to heal a lot of my food insecurities and teaching me strategies to stop labeling the foods I enjoy as “good” or “bad,” which helps me to see food in a better light in general. I highly recommend this for anyone at all who struggles with their relationship with food, regardless of your weight, health, or anything else! There has been absolutely no dieting involved, and instead, a dietician’s job is to teach you how to understand your own body better. </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: A licensed dietician is a very different (and more qualified/knowledgeable) thing than a nutritionist</p>\n\n<p>A source explaining what a licensed dietician can do, as well as the difference between dietitians and nutritionists, can be found here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dietitian-vs-nutritionist#dietitian\">https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dietitian-vs-nutritionist#dietitian</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
