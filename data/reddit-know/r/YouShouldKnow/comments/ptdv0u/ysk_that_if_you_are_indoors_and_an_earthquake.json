This is EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO.</p>\n\n<p>The official guidance is unanimous. In the event of an earthquake, do one thing and one thing ONLY:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>DUCK</strong> beneath a nearby sturdy object. If no sturdy desk, table, or countertop is available, duck next to an interior wall away form windows, heavy frames, shelves, and fixtures.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>COVER</strong> your neck and head with your arms.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>HOLD</strong> on to the object you&#39;re covering under until the shaking stops.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why YSK: In a major earthquake, it will be <em>extremely</em> difficult to move around inside a building. The ground is literally sweeping violently side to side beneath your feet. It would be like trying to run on the bed of a flatbed truck while it drives over a series of speed bumps. The danger of tripping and falling is serious, and winding up on the floor with your head and neck exposed while objects may be falling down all around you is a VERY DANGEROUS situation to be in.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if you manage to get out of the building, you will have to pass through the area immediately beneath the facade.</p>\n\n<p>Glass, masonry, concrete, etc...can very likely be separating from the facade of the building and falling to the street below, even if the building itself remains standing. You do NOT want to be in the area beneath the exterior of a building while the shaking is taking place.</p>\n\n<p>Only AFTER the shaking stops should you check for injuries, put on sturdy shoes, and calmly leave the building until it can be inspected for structural damage.</p>\n\n<p>The USGS web page on what to do during an earthquake reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are INDOORS -- STAY THERE! Get under a desk or table and hang on to it (Drop, Cover, and Hold on!) or move into a hallway or against an inside wall. STAY CLEAR of windows, fireplaces, and heavy furniture or appliances. GET OUT of the kitchen, which is a dangerous place (things can fall on you). DON&#39;T run downstairs or rush outside while the building is shaking or while there is danger of falling and hurting yourself or being hit by falling glass or debris.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The University of Washington advises:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during shaking: The area near the exterior walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades and architectural details are often the first parts of the building to collapse. To stay away from this danger zone, stay inside if you are inside and outside if you are outside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
