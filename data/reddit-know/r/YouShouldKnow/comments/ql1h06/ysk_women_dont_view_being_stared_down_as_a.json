It&#39;s come to my attention many think it&#39;s a compliment or one should be flattered.\nListen I get it, you&#39;re super hungry you see some amazing food, you stare at it. On a hike, you see a dope view, you stare at it.\nAs humans we can&#39;t stop being visually mesmerized by the things we find attractive.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK This? \nHowever, humans aren&#39;t views. I would expect that people would have a deeper understanding that having a total stranger bore holes through your skull with their eyes is unsettling at best and straight up creepfest at worst. You might be thinking &quot;oh I want her to know I think she&#39;s attractive&quot; but really she&#39;s probably thinking &quot;why won&#39;t this guy stop staring at me? Should I leave and go somewhere I&#39;m safer?&quot; .\nIf you&#39;re trying to impress her, trust me, IT&#39;S NOT WORKING, </p>\n\n<p>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO INSTEAD ? \nif you then stand up to talk to her she&#39;ll be less inclined to indulge you than if you just went up to her in the beginning without the stare DOWN. Her impression of you won&#39;t be tainted by the thoughts she might have been having while you creeped her out &amp; you might have higher chance of success! :) </p>\n\n<p>Caveat : If she visibly is interested in you and you two are exchanging flirtatious glances that&#39;s a different story all together.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
