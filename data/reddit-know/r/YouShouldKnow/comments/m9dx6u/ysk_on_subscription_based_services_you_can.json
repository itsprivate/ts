I don't have mine active because I don't listen to music often enough (I prefer podcasts, audibooks, etc). I still get special advertisements all the time about restarting my service. I happened to get one of these just after my wife's subscription price automatically renewed at the \"going rate\" (or whatever you call that ridiculously high rate they charge if you don't call and bother them). I called them up and asked for the special rate I had just been offered. \nThe guy pulls up the account and offers me some other offer which is cheaper than regular, but not as good as what I had. I asked him if I couldn't get the deal I called about. He responded \"we have to get an answer on this deal first: do you want it, yes or no.\" My response was \"not if I can get this other offer\", which he then repeated his line and I realized he was following his script literally and had to offer me some low-ball offer first before proceeding to the offer I was interested in, so I told him no and I could hear him sigh with relief as he proceeded to pull up the offer I wanted and offer it to me. I was tempted to see if there was an even better offer out there by answering no again, but didn't want to push my luck and end up canceling the service (and making the Mrs. upset). \n\nMoral of the story, you can (almost) always get your subscription based service cheaper if you call and ask. You may have to threaten to cancel (and don't be afraid to follow through if they say no, because sometimes they think your threat is empty and won't try to sell you until you are serious).\n\nEdit: fixed spelling (I do know how to spell, just on mobile). Also thanks for 1k upvotes!",
