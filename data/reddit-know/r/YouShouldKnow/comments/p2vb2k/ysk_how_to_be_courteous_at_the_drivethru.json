If you have a loud car, please turn it off when you’re ordering.\n2. Order EVERYTHING that you need at the voice box, including sauce, extra napkins, extra straws, salt packets. That way we can make sure everything’s ready for you when you arrive at the window.\n2. If the dining room is open and you are able, please order inside or use curbside pickup if you have a large order.\n3. The person handing you your food likely didn’t package it, so don’t blame them if it’s wrong.\n4. Please wear a shirt.\n5. Try to have your payment ready and don’t waste time putting your change and receipt away before driving to the next window.\n6. Before you ask for napkins, straws, or ketchup, look in the bag.\n7. If you think you can get free fries by waiting until after you pay to ask for them and hoping that the worker is too tired to ring it up, think again.\n8. If you want fresh fries, just ask for them. You don’t need to ask for “no salt” unless you really want no salt. \n9. Please know what your kids want before you pull up.\n10. Please turn off any music before you order.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
