Pretty much copy and pasted my comment from that thread, removing some profanity. Also, to be clear, I&#39;m just trying to be informative! I&#39;m not trying to call anybody out, just dispel an oft perpetuated rumor.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The &quot;active&quot; ingredient in Poison Ivy that causes the rash is Urushiol, it is a hapten molecule which means sticks to your cells (in this case, skin cells), causing your immune cells (CD8+ killer T cells) to recognize your own cells as foreign and attack, leading to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.</strong> <strong><em>This is a fundamental aspect of adaptive immune response and if you don&#39;t experience type IV reactions at all, you probably have a greater immune problem.</em></strong> <strong>If you doubt me, that&#39;s fine, but I advise you to actually look it up because pretty much any medical resource will tell you the same thing. It is not the same type of allergy as we commonly associate with seasonal or food allergies. Repeated exposure to poison ivy sensitizes you to it precisely because the reaction is mediated by the adaptive immune response, which has &quot;memory&quot; and reacts more intensely each time you are re-exposed to a given compound or microbe.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Many compounds are like this. For example, the resin used for 3D printing does the same thing, though I&#39;m not quite sure what it is exactly in the resin that is responsible for this. Each subsequent exposure results in a more dramatic effect. <strong>The reality is that the people who say they aren&#39;t allergic just haven&#39;t been exposed to it very much and/or are careful enough around it to avoid exposure altogether.</strong> I&#39;ve never had a reaction before, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to go frolicking through patches of poison ivy butt naked. My dad was &quot;immune&quot; until about a decade ago when he got a horrible reaction while doing yardwork, nearly had to go to the ER because he unknowingly spread it all over his body. Tolerance can be genetically inherited, but as you age, various factors (something to do with changes in various protein and immune marker expression) can cause you to lose that tolerance even without exposure, similar to how some people &quot;randomly&quot; develop a seafood allergy.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the 15% figure often touted online is also false if you are talking about total immunity. You may be &quot;tolerant&quot; of it but that doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t eventually have some reaction. I&#39;m not gonna beat up anybody for spreading this rumor, but it *is* potentially harmful disinformation and people should know the truth so they don&#39;t end up hurting themselves or others unintentionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully this post saves somebody from an avoidable rash and teaches people to be a bit more cautious around poison ivy, even if you are tolerant.</p>\n\n<p>Citations:</p>\n\n<p>source 1: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562228/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562228/</a></p>\n\n<p>source 2: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urushiol\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urushiol</a></p>\n\n<p>source 3: <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/poison-ivy-immunity#:%7E:text=The%20bottom%20line,to%20the%20effects%20of%20urushiol\">https://www.healthline.com/health/poison-ivy-immunity#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line,to%20the%20effects%20of%20urushiol</a></p>\n\n<p>source 4:  <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/35712-heathy-geezer-poison-ivy.html\">https://www.livescience.com/35712-heathy-geezer-poison-ivy.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
