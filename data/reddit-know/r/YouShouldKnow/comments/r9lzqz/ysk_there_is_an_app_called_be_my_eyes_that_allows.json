If you need visual help (examples given are picking the right colour of an item of clothing, or the right brand of product when shopping) and you are visually impaired, you press a button on the app. The app will call multiple volunteers (volunteers do not need to have the app open to recieve a call, they just have to be logged in) , and whoever picks up the quickest is connected by video call. The volunteer can then assist you in whatever task you need help with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thought it was a great idea and a helpful app. Currently there are over 4 million volunteers signed up, but only 310, 000 visually impaired or blind people. Thought I&amp;#39;d share in case anyone would find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
