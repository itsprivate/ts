Chitin is comes from the crunchy exoskeleton of the bugs, and have loads of benefits that help plants. They enhance the microbiota of the soil, and support fungal mycorrhizae that feed support plant roots. It also enhances the structure of the plant by activating the plants immune system, triggering it to \"bulk up\" to make it harder for bugs to take a bite out of them and for disease to destroy them. This results in a plant that is more robust, stronger, and resistant to damage. So, while cicada will keep many people up, use their dead bodies to your advantage and grow a better garden!\n\nwhy ysk: strengthening your plants to make them robust against damage and other insects and disease.",
