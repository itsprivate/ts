If someone says that you're low on refrigerant and offers to charge it for you (something that most home warranties don't cover), but they don't conduct a leak check, they're taking your money without solving the problem. \n\nIf you're low on refrigerant, where did it go? It's not fuel. It's not expended. Refrigerant facilitates the transfer of heat. If they charge your system, it'll get to work and will cool off, but all of that refrigerant is going to leak out again- it's like pumping air into a flat tire without patching the hole. Sure, it might look/feel good as soon as it's been pumped full, but nothing's been done to solve the actual problem. \n\nLeak checks suck. A tech needs to crawl around the entire system with some equipment that may not even pick up the leak, if the leak is small enough or somewhere that's hard to access. It's *much* easier to pump your system with new stuff, charge you for everything, and come back in a few months when the system quits working \"again.\"\n\nTL;DR: If an HVAC tech says you're low on refrigerant, ask them where the leak is.\n\nWhy YSK: Don't pay someone to come fix your problem if they're not going to fix the problem.",
