While for some trades may be the best way to a successful future, this does not hold true for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve trained dozens of people and watched at least %80 wash out after claiming they could handle it. Why? It’s hard, depressing, you’re going to miss your family get no thanks, and it’s out right demoralizing until you’ve mastered it unless you’re a true die hard country boy or handy man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you or your child considers trade work you have to be In perfect physical condition to even have a shot at the big bucks(some, or most tbh, forego that for hard drugs to cope). There is no I’m tired or hungry when you’re at the mercy of people that have done this for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will not quit my trade although I am in the process of getting an education. I take pride in building. Aliens didn’t build the pyramids people like you and I  did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Concrete finisher here. The broken bones, missing time with my family and pissing blood from dehydration was enough to make me reconsider my choice. 2022 college freshman at age 28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; do your research before joining trade work. You may be in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
