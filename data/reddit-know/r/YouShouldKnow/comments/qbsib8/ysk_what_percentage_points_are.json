Asking for 5% more is very different than asking for 5 percentage points more! Asking for five percentage points more than 10% means 10%+5%=15%, whereas 5% more then 10% means 10% + (10% x 5%) = 10.5%.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: Without the notion of percentage points, discussing percentages is ambiguous. This will definitely come up when refinancing your house.</p>\n\n<p>As another example, a home loan might be 3% per year. If you are renegotiating the loan for lower monthly payments, they may mention increasing the percentage by some number, like 1.5 percentage points. That means your new interest rate will be 3% + 1.5% = 4.5%. This sounds small, but really your interest rate just went up by 50%!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
