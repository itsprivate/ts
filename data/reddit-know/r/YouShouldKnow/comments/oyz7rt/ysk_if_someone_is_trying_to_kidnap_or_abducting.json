Don&#39;t worry about fighting fair, when someone is trying to take you elsewhere against your will, they are playing unfair. Do anything and everything you can, to stop them.</p>\n\n<p>Shout fire, shout rape, scream like a banshee if you have to, shout anything you can think of, to get people to come running to you. Hit, claw, punch, jab, do anything and everything to get away. </p>\n\n<p>Throw your wallet, purse or even your shoes at them, do whatever you can to get away.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in an area where you aren&#39;t allowed weapons on your person, get regular every day items like a nail filer or something similar and put it in your pocket. You can just say it&#39;s a nail filer, but it can be used as a weapon as well. Just anything to protect yourself. Doesn&#39;t have to be a nail filer, just using that as an example of an ordinary item.</p>\n\n<p>As someone in the comment said, if someone pulls up next to you, run in the opposite direction their car is facing, it&#39;ll buy you time to get away from them.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use perfume, and the like as well if you have any.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a good idea to learn basic skills of some kind of martial arts or similar, in order to protect yourself a little bit better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
