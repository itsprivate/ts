Knowing even a few of these logical fallacies will help you avoid manipulation by others and identify bad reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is a list of the types of fallacies I find to be the easiest to spot and the most commonly used. In my personal experience you can spot many of these on a daily basis and therefore public awareness of these (and other) fallacies is essential for a constructive discussion.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Argumentum Ad Hominem (short: Ad Hominem)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Argumentum Ad Hominem is probably the most common fallacy. There are different types of Ad Hominem arguments, however they all have in common, that they try to undermine the validity of an argument by critizising the character of the person presenting it.</p>\n\n<p>While you can of course critizise someone&#39;s character, this does not change their argument. A good rule of thumb, in trying to avoid these arguments, is checking if an arguments validity is influenced by the person presenting it. If it is not, you can of course critizise the person for being dishonest, the argument itself however is not changed by this. If you really want to advance in a discussion, <strong>every argument has to be independent from who is presenting it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strawman Argument</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another quite common fallacy is the Strawman Argument. In an attempt to discredit an argument the Strawman Argument exaggarates an opponents argument to the point of nobody being able to see it as a valid point of view. Other times, an opinion nobody holds will be presented as the opinion of the opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Try to ask yourself, <strong>what implications the arguments of your opponents would have and whether these are unavoidable consequences</strong>. Everything else might be interpretation and not what the argument actually suggests.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slippery Slope</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This argument tries to imply that following one action, other, absurd and/or undesirable, actions will follow. I think everyone knows the &quot;If we let... the next thing you know...&quot;, which is (almost) always used as a fallacy.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid being fooled, try to <strong>check if every action following is actually necessary and/or unavoidable</strong>. If it is not, the argument is invalid.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Argumentum ad populum (short: Ad populum)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This argument tries to suggest that popularity implies goodness. Arguing, that things are good because they are popular, implies that only good things are popular. I don&#39;t think I have to explain to anyone that many not-so-great things are popular.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid being tricked, try to think for yourself and <strong>form your own opinion</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This argument tries to imply the existence of a dilemma with only two options of which one is much worse that the other. The sentence &quot;We either do <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> will happen&quot; is a fallacy most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Avoiding being manipulated by this fallacy requires some understanding of the topic. If you do not know, which options are available, <strong>make sure that the options discussed are acutally the only options.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This list is not comprehensive and only lists some of the most common logical fallacies in no particular order. In my opinion these five fallacies can protect you from manipulation by fallacies in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>If you spot a fallacy in an argument, point it out and explain why it is a fallacy - Bonus points if you know the latin names!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Sources/See also:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
