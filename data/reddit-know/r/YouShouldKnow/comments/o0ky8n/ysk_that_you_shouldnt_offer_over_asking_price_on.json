With that, you can have your offer automatically go higher and higher, up to a pre-set amount, *if* there are other higher offers on the table. Someone else bid 10k over asking but your clause goes up to 15k? Congrats, you've got the highest offer now. Turns out you're the only offer on the table? Guess what, you just saved yourself five figures by *starting* your offer at listing price.\n\nNow, it is of course possible that a seller can simply decide to wait and see if a higher offer comes. But that doesn't automatically disqualify yours. And there are also a lot of sellers who are only ditching their homes because they've already bought another and time is a factor, so they'll take a speedy sale over waiting for a bigger number. And it's possible that a buyer's agent will simply say they're not accepting contracts with ECs. If that's the case, it's up to you to decide how badly you want that house.",
