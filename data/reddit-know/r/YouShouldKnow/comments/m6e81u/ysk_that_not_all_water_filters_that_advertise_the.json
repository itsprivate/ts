  "selftext": "Why YSK: If you go to buy 3rd party water filter replacements for your fridge/ brita they'll tell you they can remove harmful metals like lead but aren't actually certified to do so unless they have NSF 53 certification.\n\nFull story: \n\nI live in Newark, NJ, so even though there's no lead pipes in my house and my service line was replaced, I still have around 10 ppb of lead in my water. Not enough for an EPA violation but still more than I want to drink on a regular basis. When I went to buy replacement filters for my new fridge, I found [these](https://morefilter.com/glacialpure-3pack-eptwfu01-refrigerator-water-filter) which claim to be both \"NSF certified\" and capable of removing \"99% of lead\" at 1/3 the price of the OEM filter replacements.\n\nThis seems like a great deal, but here's the thing; there are actually different levels of NSF certification, and while they call these \"certified filters\" and say that certified filters remove 99% of lead, they're actually referring to two different types of certification. These filters and the majority of third party filters out there are NSF 42 certified. They're even kind enough to link you to the [Certificate on the NSF website](http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=C0553011&Standard=042). But if you go to that certificate you can clearly see that all it certifies is \"Tested at a flow rate of 0.66 gpm to a capacity of 300 gallons for the reduction of Chlorine.\" This is because NSF 42 certification only certifies the removal of odors and taste caused by chlorine. It does NOT certify in any way the removal of lead or any other harmful metal / mineral.\n\nThe ONLY filters that are actually certified to remove lead are NSF 53 certified filters. In my case the [OEM Filters](https://www.frigidaire.com/Filters--Accessories/Filters/Water-Filters/EPTWFU01/) are NSF 42, 53 and 401 certified, meaning they remove chlorine, lead, other harmful metals, and some organic contaminants like herbicides. So while you think you might be getting a good deal with 3rd party filters, and they'll claim they can remove harmful substances often by using deceptive wording, chances are they're not actually certified to do more than remove chlorine.",
