The only reason milks such as stage 2/follow on/hungry baby/growing up milks exist is to get around infant formula advertising laws. The law states that you can not advertise first stage formula because it negatively impacts breastfeeding rates, so formula companies get around this by introducing these other formulas, which are totally unnecessary. Don&#39;t stress yourself out by switching over at 6 months and beyond, keep doing what you&#39;re doing! </p>\n\n<p>Source - <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/bottle-feeding/types-of-formula/\">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/bottle-feeding/types-of-formula/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
