  "selftext": "\"A few bad apples\" has become confused with **\"a few bad** ***eggs\"***  and is incorrectly used in its place.  The two phrases DO NOT mean the  same thing. \"A few bad eggs\" is used to describe a group of something in  which  there are a number of bad individuals but which doesn't automatically mean that  the *entire*  group is bad \\*\\[or will become bad\\]. One rotten egg does not mean they will all be  rotten; it  could just be an isolated incident and the rest of the eggs will be  fine.\n\n\"A few bad apples\" describes something more nefarious, but people often leave out  the other half of the saying. The  entire phrase is \"A few bad apples *spoil the barrel.\"* It means that if even one apple is rotten then, unless it is removed, the rot will inevitably  spread and eat  through all of the apples. The true meaning is it is  dangerous to ignore what might be a small problem, because that problem might be caused by something more complicated, and ignoring it allows it to spread.\n\n**Why YSK:** Using \"a few bad apples\" to say a problem is only due to a small, isolated group of actors downplays or overlooks the **systemic** and **contagious** nature of the problem. The problem should be addressed quickly before it festers and grows into something much harder to fix.\n\n\\*edit",
