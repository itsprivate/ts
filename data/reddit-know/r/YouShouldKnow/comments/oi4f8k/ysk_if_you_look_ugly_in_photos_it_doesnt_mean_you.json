The reason is that you&#39;re just not photogenic, it happens to a lot of people. In converting a 3d image like a person into a 2d image like a photo, some features are lost. We see in 3D because we have two eyes, and a camera has one eye that can only see in 2D so it doesn&#39;t get your facial features correct Sometimes the camera literally flips the photo, like a mirror. If you look beautiful in the mirror you&#39;re most likely very beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>Cameras distort reality. Usually in subtle ways, but people who take lots of portrait shots will tell you that posture can make a world of difference, not because it changes the way you look in person, but because it strongly affects the way you show up on camera. I think some people instinctively have good camera posture and it does a lot for them. I&#39;m even aware of extreme cases of people who look good in pictures even through they&#39;re not particularly attractive.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why a lot of models look very attractive in photos but in real life umm......</p>\n\n<p>So don&#39;t get depressed about your looks just because you don&#39;t look good enough in photos. Don&#39;t be too critical of yourself, a camera never capture your beauty but other people will!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
