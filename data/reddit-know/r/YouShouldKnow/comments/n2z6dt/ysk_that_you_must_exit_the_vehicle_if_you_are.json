What will happen is that they will break your window and then forcibly drag you out of the vehicle and presume you to be hiding something, which could give them the probable cause needed (in some states with some judges) to obtain a warrant to search your car. If you really think it’s a good idea to stay inside your car, just watch some YT videos of “sovereign citizens.” The entire ordeal will be over far quicker and more painlessly if you just step out of the vehicle. \n\n>>are there any limits to their power to order me out?\n\nNo, that’s why this SCOTUS case is absolutely tyrannical.",
