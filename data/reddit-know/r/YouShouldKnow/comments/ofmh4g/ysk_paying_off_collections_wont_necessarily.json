Paying off a collection will NOT remove the negative mark on your credit score from having an account go to collections in the first place. So you might be throwing money away that is better used elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The negative mark will drop off after 7 years UNLESS you inquire about the collection. If a collection company calls and you answer and verify your identity, you’ve just restarted the 7 year timeline. This also applies if you’re making payments on the collection. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to bring your credit score up your best bet is to pay down your balances on accounts that have balances close to their limit. There are 2 ways credit utilization can impact your credit score, individual accounts and overall utilization. If you’ve been making all of your payments on time and are wondering why your credit score still won’t move up, this may be why.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Don’t pay off collections to increase credit score, pay down open accounts with high balances first.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
