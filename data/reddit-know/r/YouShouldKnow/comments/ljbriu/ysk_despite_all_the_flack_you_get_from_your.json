I used to berate him along with everyone else when we were in high school but I stopped when I realized how fucked up it was.\n\nHe wasn't the only virgin either, there were people who just lied about it to avoid being harassed about it. If you hate being harassed for it, just lie or avoid conversations about it. BEING A VIRGIN UNTIL AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IS WAY MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK. You only feel ostracized because of the culture and because no one talks about it.\n\nMy buddy did end up losing his virginity on New Years Eve when he was 22. He was drunk, the girl jumped his bones, he regretted it after, but it broke the seal. \n\nHe got over his inhibitions after that and finally became capable of talking to women in that way. Now this man is more than proficient in talking to the ladies.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is stop thinking your lack of experience and you being uncomfortable talking to women is a death sentence. People grow into themselves and their personalities at different points in their life. You're not a fucking throwaway person or forever virgin. Some flowers bloom later, doesn't mean they're not blooming flowers.\n\nLove yourself you guys",
