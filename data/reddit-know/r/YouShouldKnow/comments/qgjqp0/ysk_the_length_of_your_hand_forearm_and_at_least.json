The only problem is that I didn&#39;t know if it was slim enough to go through my front door. Fortunately I know that my open hand is about 20cm wide, and coincidentally knew that my front door is 90cm wide. Got it wrong by 3cm but the couch fitted alright.</p>\n\n<p>Another useful thing to learn is being able to measure larger distances by steps, but that&#39;s a skill I have not yet mastered.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
