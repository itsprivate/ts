It can affect your mood, your sleep and your nutrient absorption rate. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, if you aren&#39;t feeling right, check your gut. Stay up on probiotics, and keep an eye on anything you may have a sensitivity to, such as gluten, shellfish, nuts, overly processed foods, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As a personal example, I recently discovered that I have a gluten sensitivity. I suffered from anxiety and awful intrusive thoughts for years, and after going gluten free, almost all of my symptoms have entirely disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>My interest for hobbies returned, I get the &quot;tingly&quot; excitement for things again, and life seems a lot more colorful.
