If you don’t have a 2 part sink, it makes it harder to wash by hand (maybe consider using a tub), but if you do have 2 sides, fill one side w water and soap, soak dishes, scrub them while submerged, and then rinse them in the other side of the sink. It not only saves on both water and soap, but will get your dishes cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
