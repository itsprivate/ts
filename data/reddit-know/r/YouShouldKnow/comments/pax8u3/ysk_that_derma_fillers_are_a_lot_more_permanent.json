Since there is nothing tethering them in place they, like all other liquids, end up moving around. This is most easily seen in people who frequently get derma fillers where their face starts rounding up, they get a shelve on their top lip or a build up under the eyes (tear trough fillers).</p>\n\n<p>MRI scans show that, for example, lip filler isn&#39;t breaking down but rather moving upwards towards the nose and downwards to the chin. This gives the illusion that the filler has broken down and people go back to get another injection.</p>\n\n<p>For a good and scientific breakdown of this I highly recommend checking out the Victorian Cosmetic Institute on YT where DR. Gavin Chan goes over the above in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yoF_Ez27-L0\">https://youtu.be/yoF_Ez27-L0</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
