I always use the rule of thumb that passing should take 10 seconds maximum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is with weather that causes bad sight (think heavy fog or rain) a lot of people just slam their brakes. But it&amp;#39;s way safer to just keep driving the recommended speed, since that makes you predictable. If you don&amp;#39;t trust the poor vision, go to the right lane and gradually lower your speed, if you plan to go slower than 80 km/h on the highway turn on your hazards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read the situation on the road, sometimes speeding up/not slowing down is the right course of action. (Note: read sometimes. Don&amp;#39;t go blasting 200 on the daily just because of this post)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
