Snap pics of everything you enjoy in your time outside even if it’s a walk in the park and post them to places like <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist </a> and <a href=\"https://plantnet.org/\">Plantnet</a> for free. You don’t need to know what it is exactly just post the pic and your location and it helps the scientists out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
