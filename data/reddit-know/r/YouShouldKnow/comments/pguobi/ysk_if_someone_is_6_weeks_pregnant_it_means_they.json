When the 6 week abortion law is mentioned it often goes with the phrase “before many women even know they’re pregnant”. But what many don’t realize (because why would you when you’re not trying to have a baby) is that weeks are counted from date of last period, so it’s impossible to be 2 or even really 3 weeks pregnant. So the reality is that someone has at most, around 2 weeks to realize they’re pregnant if they want to terminate.  So yeah, these laws are fucked and maybe even more fucked than you think.
