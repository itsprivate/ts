This is the equivalent of 160 cups of coffee or about 200 cans of RedBull. Same price for 100mg capsules (but I recommend breaking the 200mg in half). Many of us need caffeine to do our jobs at the expected pace (at least here in the US), and I see so many of my coworkers waste hundreds a month to get that fix.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I love about getting my caffeine this way is it allows me to drink water most of the time, which is both the cheapest and healthiest beverage. I drink coffee too slowly to get my caffeine and hydration fast enough. Also, I personally find the extra vitamins and supplements in energy drinks make me agitated and angry. </p>\n\n<p>Some people get the jitters from this form of caffeine, which can be helped by taking it after food.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps save someone some of their hard earned cash!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
