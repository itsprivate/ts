For some fish like the common goldfish, this is important because they can get up to a foot. Cramming them in a small space means there body grows while their organs don't. Also for other fish like bettas, it just doesn't feel right confining them to such a small space. This mean, while a goldfish lives for 10-20 years with GOOD care, you'd be lucky to have one live for 2 years.\n\n Next is because of ammonia nitrite and nitrate and a lack of a filter. You have filters in fish tank for two main reasons. 1. is to agitate the water. 2. Is to grow beneficial bacteria. \nYou may wonder, what is beneficial bacteria? It is a type of bacteria that consumes ammonia, a common toxin in a fishes poop. Then it turns it into nitrite which is just as harmful.  Then finally, it converts it to nitrate which is much less harmful. Even having a tiny filter doesn't fix most stuff,  because some fish like goldfish produce a CRAP ton of waste and the bacteria can't keep up. Also some fish like bettas are tropical fish and most bowls don't have a filter. Most bettas that live in bowls don't last more than 6 months.\n\nFinally bowls are bad because if the surface area. Even with a filter, the surface area doesn't allow the bowl to oxygenate which is bad for the fish.\n\n I say \"almost all\" because if you were too keep a 10 gallon bowl with cherry shrimp that's filtered and heater and has a lot of plants that would be ok. Even though the tank size for a betta is 5 Gallons, a bowl of 5 gallons just doesn't have enough surface area. \n\nI could go on and on and on but I will keep this a short as possible.",
