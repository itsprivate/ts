This time I called Spectrum to cancel my service all together. They aggressively tried to convince me not to cancel by asking “Is it the price? If it’s the price we can offer a discount so you only have to pay $60/month.” When I say “aggressively” I mean it. I literally had to argue with the CSR stating that my reason is because of an out-of-state move and not the price. They even offered $50/month. I wish I knew about this a year ago, I would’ve saved $300.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I’m in no way guaranteeing that your particular cable &amp; internet service provider will offer you a discount. I’m just saying it’s worth a shot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
