For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad (joking): &amp;quot;It sounds like your house is haunted!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sister: &amp;quot;It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Do you have a CO detector in your house?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sister: &amp;quot;No.  Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dull headache&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional symptoms can be found &lt;a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know are inexplicably experiencing any of these symptoms: get the hell out of the house IMMEDIATELY and pick up a CO detector, then call a plumber if it goes off.  You could potentially save lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  Forgot to mention - Symptoms go away after leaving the house for a while, such as visiting family.  My sister and her husband said they feel great when they aren&amp;#39;t in the house.  This is another significant indicator of CO poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
