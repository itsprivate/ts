  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: your data can often still be recovered, and hacked, even after your request that it be deleted was confirmed by a company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked as a data scientist in big tech, and observed that data deletion is tricky business. Data governance laws vary by country and even state, and range quite widely. In some jurisdictions, there are no requirements: a company owns the data generated through your interactions with its services. Other countries/states do have data ownership/privacy requirements, but even the most stringent laws often require that data not be actually deleted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many large companies retain data for &amp;quot;compliance&amp;quot; reasons. A request to delete personal data, while often honored for marketing purposes by companies seeking to operate legally (not all do), is often considered legally compliant if a company only locks your data away rather than deletes it. Data access in these cases is usually limited to a handful of people dedicated to the data privacy compliance effort, but the data is often kept for months and even years. This is not a company&amp;#39;s fault, but rather is mandated by other laws--ones that help identify corruption, market manipulation, anti-consumer actions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While retaining data is useful for the above reasons, this legal mess can create confusion for ordinary people. In practice, your data is often accessible even after a company &amp;quot;deletes&amp;quot; it. Given that data breaches in today&amp;#39;s world are effectively only a matter of time at any given company, you can pretty much assume that any online interaction you make can one day surface. Companies do have an obligation to try to keep this from happening, but can seldom be counted on as software often relies on hundreds and thousands of other pieces of software as dependencies--consistently updating all of which is incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
