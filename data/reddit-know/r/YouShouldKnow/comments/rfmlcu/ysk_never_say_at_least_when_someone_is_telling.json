In actuality, their problem is bad to them and that’s what matters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also dismisses them and does not let them finish speaking about it. “At least” shuts them down. They should not have to defend why their problem is a problem to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, just because they do not have it the worst or it could be worse, does not mean that they are not experiencing the pain from their own problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The example I’ve seen countless times is simple. If someone is telling you about a miscarriage and the emotional/physical pain they are experiencing and you reply, “at least you can have (or already have) children,” you are completely shutting them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: here’s a source &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
