Grab a box cutter, and just slice through all the hair and it&#39;ll come right out.</p>\n\n<p>If you do this every once in a while, your vacuum will work near good as new. The most common things that burn out a vacuum is something is clogged up, causing intense strain on the equipment. </p>\n\n<p>Taking 10-20 minutes to just pull crap out will save you from having to buy a whole new vacuum.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Am airbnb host and have done way more than my fair share of vacuuming.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
