To avoid that and create a much healthier public discourse, pay close attention on how you pose the question. The best way to generate a productive confrontation is to be empathetic in your wording, to try and understand where the other person is coming from, no matter how wrong you think they are. For example, a usually very hot subject is abortion: if you are pro-choice discussing with pro-life people, wording the question as \"why are you against freedom of choice for women?\" will surely put off the counterparts, making them feel like you're not there to listen but to prove a point. They will start to do the same with you, making the discussion too polarized and partisan to be productive. Try maybe to rephrase the question as \"why do you think life is inherently sacred?\" or \"do you think there are situations in which your judgement would change? If so, why?\". The same is true vice-versa: instead of asking \"why do you support killing babies in the womb?\" try with \"what are the cases that make abortion right in your opinion?\". Rephrasing the question in this way shifts the moral realm of the discussion from yours to theirs, making them open up and be more inclined to pay attention to your reasons.\n\nTry to listen and understand rather than debate and declare. ",
