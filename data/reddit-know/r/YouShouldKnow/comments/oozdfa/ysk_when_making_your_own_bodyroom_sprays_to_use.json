One common ingredient listed is witch hazel or vodka to help bind everything together, but that was the most explanation I could find. I came across an article that goes into the science behind why using a particular-strength ethanol base for body and room sprays is preferable to just plain vodka or witch hazel.</p>\n\n<p>The article explains that in order to properly solubilize (dissolve and incorporate) a solution of distilled water and essential oils, one would need to add 190-proof ethanol (grain) alcohol to the mixture. For anti-microbial purposes, a minimum 151-proof ethanol (grain) alcohol is recommended. (If using 190-proof to solubilize, one would not need to then add 151-proof to prevent microbial growth.) Most vodkas are only 80- or 100-proof, which is not sufficient for solubilization or preservation. Products like witch hazel are water-based and so have the potential to introduce undesired microbes.</p>\n\n<p>Using distilled water over filtered or tap water doesn&#39;t make a difference (to my knowledge) in the solubilizing process, but it does make a difference when trying to prevent microbial growth. Even filtered water can contain microbes, and so it is best to use distilled water when making a product that will sit for long periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Link to the article: <a href=\"https://tisserandinstitute.org/effective-use-alcohol-aromatic-blending/\">https://tisserandinstitute.org/effective-use-alcohol-aromatic-blending/</a></p>\n\n<p>Finding trustworthy and accurate articles on beauty products and DIY home/body care products is challenging. If anyone can find better articles about this and/or from more reputable sources, please let me know! This was the best I could find in an afternoon of searching.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
