This is one of the most important factors in finding a pair of glasses that fits well. Find a frame that is slightly wider than your face — no more than a finger width between the temple and your face. Any wider is a sign your frames are too wide. (This measurement is not printed on the temple of your glasses. To find it, take your measuring tape and measure horizontally across the front of your frames, including any hinges or design features that stick out on the sides.)\n\nThe numbers, from left to right are for:\n\n#LENS WIDTH\n\nTo determine which lens size is right for you, know that a small lens width is 50mm or less, medium is between 51mm and 54mm and large is any lens wider than 55mm.\n\nYour eyes should be centered within your lenses. Eyeglass frames that are too wide will make your eyes appear too close together, while narrow frames will give your eyes a wide-set look.\n\n#TEMPLE LENGTH\n\nTemple length is the measurement in millimeters of the “arms” of the frame. This measurement does not vary as much as the others. 135mm, 140mm, 145mm, and 150mm are the most common options. The temple should fit horizontally and evenly along your face and fit comfortably along the outside of your ear.\n\n#BRIDGE WIDTH\n\nThe distance between two lenses equals a frame's bridge width. The bridge should sit comfortably flush against your nose. If you have close-set eyes or want a narrow bridge, this number should be lower. If you have wide-set eyes or want a wide bridge, this number should be higher.\n\nThe location of your nose can help determine which frame style works best for you. If your nose is higher on your face, an eyeglass style where the bridge is even with the frame’s brow line will look best. If your nose is situated a bit lower on your face, a frame with a lower bridge and curved brow line will better suit your features.",
