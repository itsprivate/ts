But the fact is they want you to call if you&#39;re even having thoughts about it. I called a friend who works at a hospital. And before anyone answered the phone it was &quot;hang up and dial 911 for emergencies, press 2 if you&#39;re having thoughts about suicide... etc.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t have to be almost dead to get help. You don&#39;t have to wait till the pain is no longer bearable before you consider having some else help you bear that load. You don&#39;t even have to bear the thought of suicide alone. Even if it crosses your mind for any reason, call them. It&#39;s free. They aren&#39;t going to charge you. And it&#39;s always better to Start to develop the relationship sooner, so you can be more confident in the help you&#39;ll get. And you don&#39;t have to call the same line every time, if you need to just speak to someone else, or you&#39;re embarrassed, you can call privately or use a throwaway phone paid with cash if it&#39;s really bad. But the point is, you don&#39;t have to wait till you&#39;re really hurting. </p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s never too late. If you&#39;re reading this, it&#39;s not too late. You have the time, and you always will. Because nothing is more important than your life. If you&#39;re on here, and need help, then you should just call right now. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr: You don&#39;t have to wait. You can be anonymous if you need. Just don&#39;t wait till it&#39;s really bad. But it&#39;s never too late.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
