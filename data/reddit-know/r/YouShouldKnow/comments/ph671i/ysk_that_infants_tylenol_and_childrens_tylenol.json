The dosage directions given on both bottles are the same based on children&#39;s age and weight. Both packages will state &quot;ask a doctor&quot; for kids under 2 years old. Which you should be doing, to know how much to give your child.</p>\n\n<p>The only real difference is the infants bottle has less (60ml VS 120ml) medicine and comes with a syringe to administer the medicine to the child. But if you already have syringes for liquid medicines you should be fine getting the Children&#39;s bottle. Or most pharmacies will give you a free medicine syringe if you ask them and tell them it&#39;s to give your child Tylenol.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference is however, the Infant&#39;s package is often 2 or 3 times the price compared to the Children&#39;s bottle and there really isn&#39;t a good reason for it. If you continue to buy the Infant&#39;s bottle, you are essentially paying more money for less medicine and collecting syringes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/27/726327937/tylenol-for-infants-and-children-is-the-same-why-does-1-cost-3-times-more\">Reference!</a></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As some comments mentioned, this shouldn&#39;t just be assumed for all medicines. Please read the bottles and consult doctors and pharmacists. And yes, this wasn&#39;t always the case, as they talk about in the article there used to be a difference years ago, but no longer the case. But yes, please look at the bottles in case you have bottles from before 2011 (but why though?) those changes were made by the FDA.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
