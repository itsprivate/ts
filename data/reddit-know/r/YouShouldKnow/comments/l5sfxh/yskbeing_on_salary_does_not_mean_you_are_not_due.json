While a position must  be a salaried position in order to be exempt from overtime, this is not  the only required criteria. Whether or not you are due overtime pay is  also based in great part on the nature of your job as well as your  salary. If you are not sure about your particular job, [this article](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/exempt-and-a-non-exempt-employee-2061988)  explains what criteria a job must meet to be exempt from overtime. One  example of wage theft due it improper adherence to these rules is  claiming that certain positions, often clerical/secretarial, qualify for  the \"Administrative Exemption\". However this exemption requires that  \"their primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and  independent judgment with respect to matters of significance\" which many  of these positions do not.\n\nIf a  salaried position is not exempt from overtime, hours over 40 per week  must be paid for at a pro-rated overtime rate. If your position is not  exempt from overtime and your employer has not been paying this rate,  they owe you back pay and may also owe you significant money for damages  amounting to as much as double the total value of the unpaid overtime.\n\nYou  cannot agree to work without getting paid overtime. Even if you agreed  to that, the agreement is null and void and you are still owed overtime  pay.\n\nIf you have been the victim  of wage theft you should not be embarrassed or feel as though it is your  fault any more than any other person who is the victim of a theft  should feel. It is not your legal responsibility to know these rules, it  is your employers. The reality is that our society has become complex  enough that it is almost impossible for every person to know every rule  that applies to them. This is why specialists in diverse fields like  law, accounting, and in this case human resources exist.\n\nCall  1-866-4USWAGE for the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division hotline if you think you may be the victim of wage theft.",
