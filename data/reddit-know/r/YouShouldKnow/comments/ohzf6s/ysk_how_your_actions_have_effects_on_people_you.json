Also, over the years I&#39;ve lost an unfair amount of friends and family to unhealthy thoughts and urges, like I myself, among millions have experienced. Tonight my wife, who lives separately to me, left a happy house party to see a neighbour, a mutual friend, dropping from a rope as she walked to her flat. My wife held her legs up, and managed to cut her down when people finally responded to her shouts. She held her head while the amulance came. Nobody knows if our friend will survive. I&#39;ve been crying for 2 hours after the call from Wife. I&#39;ve tried multiple times in multiple ways to end my life, because I hate almost everything, but I&#39;m finally realising how much it fucks people up, even if you don&#39;t think about them when you&#39;re making that decision. Don&#39;t give in to the bad, just do the good you can while you&#39;re here. Please.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
