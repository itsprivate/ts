I&amp;#39;ve seen paywalls that range from $50-$200 just to get access to one article. SciHub was founded by a Kazakhstan woman, Alexandra Elbakyan, to make scientific information more accessible to the general public. As a STEM major, I look through tons of research papers every week and a friend of mine recently told me about this, so I wanted to share incredible resource for anyone who is unaware, especially people in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: So glad to see everyone sharing additional resources &amp;amp; information about the inner workings of publishing research in general. I had no idea that it was such a monopolized industry &amp;amp; scientists actually have to pay if they want people to read their research. Thanks to everyone &amp;amp; please continue sharing this vital info! - signed a future scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
