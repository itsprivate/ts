I’ve found the best way is to use a hairdryer set on high and simply leaving it over each bite for as long as possible, ideally around 15 seconds. The area will itch during the process for a few seconds and then immediately go away. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can heat up a spoon over a stovetop and apply it directly to the skin. Just make sure it’s hot but not too hot that it’ll burn you.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: mosquito bites can be really annoying and scratching the area can make itching worse and even cause infection. This method is safe, simple, uses equipment nearly everyone has and can be done in minutes. </p>\n\n<p>As far as why it works, it has to do with heat breaking down heparin, which is found in mosquito saliva. It prevents clotting which makes it easier to suck blood. Unfortunately it also causes inflammation and itching. Heat destroys heparin and the foreign proteins, stopping the autoimmune response.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
