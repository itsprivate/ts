With more and more bars opening up and strange drinks on the menu, please just ask your bartender or server how a drink (flaming or with weird attachments) is meant to be drunk. Sometimes a drink is meant to burn out first and then drunk warm. Sometimes they are meant for you to look at for a moment and then cover with your hand for a moment. Blowing them out spreads the alcohol and the flame and could be dangerous as well. As we return to bars and bartenders get creative, be safe!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
