But each raptor, or breeding pair, prefer to have their own territory to hunt in. Especially as food becomes more scarce in the winter. Beginning now, and extending throughout the winter is what a lot of wildlife biologists refer to as “Raptor Season”. This is the final test basically for these babies, seeing if they can survive throughout the winter. They may be more desperate. Usually they won’t go after anything near humans (even chickens despite how many hawks have taken your chickens, only large ones can and even then they would prefer squirrel) however during this time they are more focused on not starving than safety. They may dive into cars, try to go after barn cats, try to go after chickens, or you may even find them in your yard. Raptors that become too weak to fly will quickly get parasites from prolonged time on the ground, keeping them grounded until they find help or die. Keep an extra eye out and extra caution for our winged friends as we progress more into winter!</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr Raptor starvation during the winter can lead to increased exposure</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
