Sadly, this kind of news happen way too often.\n\nWhy YSK :\n\nAbandoned syringes are EXTREMELY dangerous but can also be attractive to children.\n\nKids are often exposed to syringes, but rarely to their risks (cartoons, visits to the doctor, etc…), so they can be tempted to pick it up and manipulate it (perfect tool to play doctors right ?).\n\nThis kind of syringe was often used to do drugs, it can carry diseases and it can still contain a small amount of drug. And can be found pretty much everywhere, especially in / around a city.\n\nSo you should have a serious talk about this with your children, show them different kind of syringes, tell them that they are dangerous and should NEVER be touched. Really make sure to not associate the risk with only the needle, but with the whole syringe, and to not touch it even if they can't see any needle at the end of it.\n\nNot only that, but to immediately alert an adult about it.\n\nNow what should you do if you or your kid find an abandoned syringes ?\n\nSomething needs to be done, you can’t leave it like that. Most countries / cities have online tools to report such things, a quick google research “abandoned syringes \\[your location\\]” should give you the steps to follow.\n\nEDIT TO ADD :\n\nI forgot to mention : ask your child if he saw anyone plays with it, another kid could have already hurt himself and might not tell his parents.\n\nIf you can’t find anything online, call the authorities (maybe the non emergency line).\n\nIf it's in a place that could have some staff to maintain it (park, building area, parking lots, etc..) you need to go report it to them as well, so they can secure the area, and they maybe already know who to call for that.\n\nEDIT: Typos",
