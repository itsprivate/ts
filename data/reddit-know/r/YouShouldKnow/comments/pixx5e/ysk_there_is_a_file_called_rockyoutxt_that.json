Those lists allow to hack a ton of accounts in a short time thanks to the limited amount of trials necessary for statistically good results. If a hacker is going to try and get into your account, this list will be used. If your password isn&#39;t on it, he will most likely not try further and your account should be safe from brute force attacks.</p>\n\n<p>This is the best thing you can do to prevent your account from randomly getting hacked. To note that your password should still be long enough to prevent brute forcing with <em>all</em> character combinations (recommended 8+ characters) and that will not prevent social engineering attacks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
