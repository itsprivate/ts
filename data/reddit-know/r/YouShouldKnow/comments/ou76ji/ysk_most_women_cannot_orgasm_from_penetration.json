Not saying that the penis isn&#39;t important, but it&#39;s just not as important as some men believe that it is.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did not mean &quot;letting her&quot; as a bad thing. I&#39;m a woman by the way. I just mean that &quot;some&quot; (not all men), think of having a woman having orgasms or doing extra stuff for her is extra work/a chore for &quot;some&quot; of them. Like, it&#39;s not something that they worry about as long as they get theirs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
