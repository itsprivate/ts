For one, it could be considered rude, and the worker probably has to take special care to not hurt customers&amp;#39; feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, the worker can&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;ve got to go&amp;quot; and walk away. They have to stay, sometimes at the exact spot where you&amp;#39;re having the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that they can really do is maybe say &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of work to do, can we talk later?&amp;quot;, but some people wouldn&amp;#39;t want to lie if they &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; actually have work to do, and it can be awkward even if it&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work at a hotel and this happens all the time. It&amp;#39;s basically in my job description to be engaged with guests at all times, during conversations both casual and otherwise, which makes them think that I like these talks way more than I actually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when I try to give hints that I&amp;#39;m not into it by not saying much, shifting my eye contact to my desk, or typing on my computer, they rarely get the hint. It&amp;#39;s a terrible feeling to be all but forced to have a conversation when you really would rather not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t keep people in long conversations unless you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;#39;re into it, especially if the other party is at their job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
