Organic foods are simply free of hormones and antibiotics. Organic produce is grown using fewer synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic foods have really no nutritional advantage over non-organic foods. I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy organic, I certainly do. I’m just tired of hearing how shopping organic is often compared to a whole food lifestyle in aspects of nutritional value. Ethically and certainly environmentally, organic foods can be better but there is barely a difference in nutritional value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
