It uses roughly the same melody as &amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;quot; for the same eight bars, but with much better lyrics. The original lyrics are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What day is today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s Nibbler&amp;#39;s birthday!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a day for a birthday!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let&amp;#39;s all have some cake!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These lyrics were written for TV in order to avoid infringing the copyright for &amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;quot;, but they are good enough to replace &amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;quot; entirely if adopted by the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: Saying the phrase &amp;quot;Happy birthday to you&amp;quot; four times in a row is boring and embarassing for everyone involved, and is often thought of as the least fun part of a birthday party. These lyrics are more fun and creative, and they touch on the most exciting themes for a child: special occasions, attention, and cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
