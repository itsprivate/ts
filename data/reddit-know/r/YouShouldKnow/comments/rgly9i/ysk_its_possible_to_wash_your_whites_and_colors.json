I&amp;#39;ve done this many times using Oxi-clean White Revive and it&amp;#39;s always worked. I believe there&amp;#39;s other brands with similar products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just be careful not to wash clothes with heavy ink (e.g. Tie-dye or sharpie) in the same load as whites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: To clarify, the whitening powder isn&amp;#39;t strictly necessary unless you want to use a whitener. A lot of people do, but if you don&amp;#39;t, then you can skip it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
