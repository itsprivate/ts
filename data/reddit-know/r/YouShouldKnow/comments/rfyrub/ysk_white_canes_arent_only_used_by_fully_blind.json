In most places, you are required to stop for people with a white cane (or guide dog).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, white canes with a red tip are for people who are deaf blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this was posted 6 years ago, but I saw some thread of people arguing about if a person with a white cane could see someone in front of them. Sometimes they can !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
