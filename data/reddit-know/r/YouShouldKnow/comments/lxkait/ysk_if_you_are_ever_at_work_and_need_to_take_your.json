I had chipotle the night before and was omitting a higher frequency of deadly gas without even realizing my mask was still there. Once I finished my job I had about 6 hours of work left where my mask was required. Needless to say the smell did NOT leave my mask and I suffered quite a bit that day. This may seem silly but if I can save ONE person from suffering this tragedy, I am happy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
