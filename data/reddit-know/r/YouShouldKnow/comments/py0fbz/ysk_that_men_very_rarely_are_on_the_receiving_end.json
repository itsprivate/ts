I make it a personal goal to give 10 compliments per day either in person or online BUT I very very rarely compliment men due to past trauma from the hands of a man and now I have a general fear of them. I am in therapy and working on it. Anyway, today at the gym, a gentleman had a really cool shirt on that said “train everything” and it caught my eye. I didn’t say anything because I was scared I’d be seen as flirting or he’d see it as an excuse to flirt with ME and I didn’t want that. So I stayed silent. But, when I ran into him again at the water fountain I shoved my fears down and said </p>\n\n<p>“Hey I really like your shirt!!! And it fits you so well!” </p>\n\n<p>AND MY GOD YALL!!! The SMILE I got from this man! He was absolutely BEAMING. He just said “wow thank you so much!” And that was it. I couldn’t believe how incredibly happy he looked. I’ve seen that look from women before but not nearly as drastic. He looked like a starving man who was just offered a steak dinner. </p>\n\n<p>It made me realize that while I am still very scared of men from my past trauma, 99% of them are just humans who deserve compliments just like women BUT… they don’t get them very often. Like it’s difficult for a cis man to compliment another man, especially on his body or attire, because it might be seen as <strong><em>GASP</em></strong> “gay”. And while that is an issue that also needs addressed, I think we, as women, can do our part too. Of course always stay safe and trust your gut, but let’s compliment some men together!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
