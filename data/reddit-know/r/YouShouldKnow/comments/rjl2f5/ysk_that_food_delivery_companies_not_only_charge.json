Those ads you see all the time for “free delivery” really mean “no delivery fee.” There’s also 15-20% service fees, they inflate menu prices, and add surge fees and minimum cart fees. Sales taxes are also calculated differently from app to app! One item that’s $10 on the menu could very well be $17 on a delivery app. I usually avoid these fees by either 1. Picking up the food myself or 2. Using a food delivery aggregator like FoodBoss or MealMe. &lt;a href=\"https://www.foodboss.net/\"&gt;Foodboss&lt;/a&gt; has a website, but only operates in a few cities and compares 2 major services. &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealme-doordash-grubhub-etc/id1460140965\"&gt;MealMe&lt;/a&gt; works in every city and compares all the apps, but is only on iOS. Whatever you choose, make sure to always tip!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
