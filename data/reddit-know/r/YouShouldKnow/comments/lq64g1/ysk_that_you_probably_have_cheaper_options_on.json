Often times you will only be given the most expensive coverage option as it generates the most revenue. And this option usually has a bunch of features you might not even care for but were never explained to you. Just know there are usually cheaper options that still give you the coverage you need.\n\nFor example I have Verizon. If you walked into a store right now they would tell you that insuring your device would either cost you $17/mo for their Verizon Protect program, or $15/mo for their Total Mobile Protection plan.\n\nHowever they have 3 options they will never mention unless you personally bring them up which are Total Equipment Coverage (TEC), Extended Warranty (EW), and Wireless Phone Protection (WPP).\n\nIn Verizon's case I'll explain the differences between the different options :\n\n**$17 VZ Protect**\n\n* Has coverage against lost, stolen, or damaged devices\n* Has extended warranty\n* Has Identify Theft Protection\n* Has Call filtering for Spam calls\n* Has Tech Coach (24/7 tech support through an app or on the phone)\n\n**$15 TOTAL MOBILE PROTECTION**\n\n* Has coverage against lost, stolen, or damaged devices\n* Has extended warranty\n* Has Tech Coach (24/7 tech support through an app or on the phone)\n\nNow let's look at the options they don't tell you about:\n\n**$11 TOTAL EQUIPMENT COVERAGE**\n\n* Has coverage against lost, stolen, or damaged devices\n* Has extended warranty\n\n**$6.85 WIRELESS PHONE PROTECTION**\n\n* Has coverage against lost, stolen, or damaged devices\n\n**$5 EXTENDED WARRANTY**\n\n* extends your device's warranty pass the manufacture's warranty for as long as you are paying for it.\n\nFor most people, Wireless Phone Protection is all they possibly need, and it is almost $10 cheaper then what they're going to offer you when signing up. That's an extra $120 a year PER LINE that you might be able to save.\n\nSo check with your phone provider and see what options they have available. Additionally, most carriers will give you these options online as well so you might be able to make the changes yourself!",
