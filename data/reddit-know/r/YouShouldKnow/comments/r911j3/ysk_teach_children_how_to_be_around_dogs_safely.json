If you want to have a dog in your family it is important to teach kids how to interact with dogs safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Yes! People should train their dogs! But also it’s really important kids are taught certain elements of how to protect themselves. These are what I teach kids with families with dogs to work on safety. I am never excusing untrained dogs. I became a dog trainer because I care about dog training and well trained dogs. I am not blaming children for dog bites at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I routinely see as a dog trainer is how many dogs are absolutely terrified of children. It’s not necessarily due to bad experience. Rather, kids move sporadically and unpredictably; they vocalize in unusual patterns. Dogs are used to human movement but children do not move in ways dogs can easily read. Many dogs will not chase an adult out for a run but will chase a child that is skipping or sprinting down the side walk. This is partially due to the unpredictable nature of the way kids move; when dogs see those kinds of movement patterns instincts to herd/chase can be activated. To keep children in your care safe around dogs here are a few simple rules I used to explain to children I worked with:\n1) If you see a dog, stop running. Try not to run or skip around dogs. A lot of dogs have herding and chasing instincts, and they may see these sudden movements an invitation to run towards you. They do not want to hurt you but they may also not want to play with you. It is safest for you to never run around when you see a dog. \n2) If a dog is scared of you, it does not mean you have done something wrong. Lots of dogs have had different experiences and do not know whether strangers will be nice to them. \n3) Do not scream or shout near or at dogs, try to lower your voice if you are playing with a dog. Screaming may scare them and many dogs will act defensively when scared. They do not want to hurt you but they may be concerned that you may hurt them.\n4) If you want to say hi to a dog and the owner says it is okay, make sure the dog can see your hand. Instead of reaching for the top of their head see if they will let you pet them under the chin. Instead of approaching them from the front, you can try approaching the dog from the side with your hand extended. Dogs will approach each other from the side to indicate non threatening and friendly behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
