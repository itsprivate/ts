Second is the opposite, I still have people with notes to drive safe in the ice, they didn’t get the last package, they’ll be out of town until x date so leave somewhere hidden, and things of that nature that people probably don’t realize is still showing up and no idea why they have front door marked as delivery location but packages are still going to the garage half the time because of a note 6 months ago they’ll be out of town.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
