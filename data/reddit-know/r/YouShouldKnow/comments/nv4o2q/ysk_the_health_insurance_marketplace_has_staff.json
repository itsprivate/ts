It takes a little more time but it may be very worth it.\n\nYesterday I found out that because of some weird billing issue my health insurance was canceled. The health insurance company transferred me to the marketplace to dispute the problem; the woman I spoke with walked me through reapplication and showed me that as a grad student with a fairly low income I was actually due a monthly health insurance credit of more than $400. So instead of paying $112 a month I’m now paying $24 for a plan that’s actually worth about $500 a month.",
