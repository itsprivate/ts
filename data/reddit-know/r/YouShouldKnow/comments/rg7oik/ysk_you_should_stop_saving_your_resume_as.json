That includes saving it as PDF, making the information clear and saving it in the format of full name followed by job title you&amp;#39;re applying for: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;FirstLast-JobTitle.pdf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see thousands of resumes and so few people remember to do this! It makes it so hard to find and share if you don&amp;#39;t put it in an easily referencable format. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
