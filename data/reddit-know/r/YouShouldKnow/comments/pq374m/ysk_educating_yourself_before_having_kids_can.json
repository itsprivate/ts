Do you have an emotional support system that is close by who can babysit for you? Daycare can be crazy expensive, so having someone who is a family member or friend that lives close can help.</p>\n\n<p>What about your current job? Would you be able to take time off work if your baby/kid was suddenly sick? Etc. These are just some of the things you need to think about.</p>\n\n<p>Do both of you have a job? Normally a couple who is trying, they both have to work to make ends meet.</p>\n\n<p>Do you expect your kid to go to college? Are you able to set aside money for them to go to a college?</p>\n\n<p>What if your kid has autism, ADHD, or something else? Do you have the means to get them the help that they need?</p>\n\n<p>People should think more on if they&#39;re able to afford kids right now, before having them. Thinking about a life changing situation like this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
