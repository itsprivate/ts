And due to the unfortunate controversial nature of rape/ rape-culture in itself, stuff like the psychological repercussions of it are often not spoken about enough and swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Rape trauma syndrome” (RTS) is the name attributed to the disruptions to normal, physical, emotional, and interpersonal behavior as a result of an assault. There are different stages assigned to the time after the assault. Symptoms can range from a complete minimization of the abuse (blaming oneself, watering it down), to dramatization (cannot stop speaking about it). Needless to say the emotional/physical effects of a rape range greatly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sexual relationships of a rape survivor often become disturbed and they too, range greatly. Some victims shield from contact and develop a fear of intimacy, while others become hyper sexual or “promiscuous” as a subconscious means to reassert a measure of control over their sexual relationships. While this is a documented and common experience, it’s often overshadowed by the depiction of a sex-repulsed survivor. Sometimes due to the shame of it and purity culture in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
