It&#39;s called the &quot;emoji keyboard&quot;, but it isn&#39;t just emojis.</p>\n\n<p>Worth mentioning since it confused me briefly: there are 3 tabs at the top for selecting between emojis, emoticons/dongers, and supplemental unicode characters <strong><em>AND</em></strong> there&#39;s a row of tabs at the bottom that just looks like symbols, but selects subcategories.</p>\n\n<p>You can type to search (emojis only, for some reason), press enter to insert, and press escape to exit.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the old charmap.exe (to find it, press win+r and type it in), and even some &quot;aftermarket&quot; options like WinCompose (which you can find on github).
