  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of huddling around a lovely warm fire with loved ones is so deeply and culturally ingrained that it can be very difficult to accept just how terrible it is for health. But the health risks are clear, and smoke from a wood fire damages your respiratory system and heart in a similar fashion to cigarette smoking. Light fires frequently enough and it can become much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#Health_effects\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; summary perfectly describes how bad it is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_smoke\"&gt;wood smoke&lt;/a&gt; contributed to &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis#Chronic_bronchitis\"&gt;chronic bronchitis&lt;/a&gt;, chronic interstitial &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_disease\"&gt;lung disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_arterial_hypertension\"&gt;pulmonary arterial hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corpulmonale&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1\"&gt;corpulmonale&lt;/a&gt; (Pulmonary heart disease), and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC [Residential Wood Combustion] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung\"&gt;lung&lt;/a&gt; function in young &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthmatics\"&gt;asthmatics&lt;/a&gt;; increased incidence of acute &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis\"&gt;bronchitis&lt;/a&gt; and severity/frequency of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheezing\"&gt;wheezing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coughing\"&gt;coughing&lt;/a&gt;; and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_infections\"&gt;respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;. Residential wood combustion &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas\"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt; also contain &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_sulfur_oxides\"&gt;sulfur oxides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides\"&gt;nitrogen oxides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide\"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; and potentially &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenic\"&gt;carcinogenic&lt;/a&gt; compounds including &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons\"&gt;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene\"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde\"&gt;formaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds\"&gt;dioxins&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-9\"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;The Washington State Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system\"&gt;respiratory systems&lt;/a&gt; are unable to filter &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates\"&gt;particulates&lt;/a&gt; emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen\"&gt;carcinogens&lt;/a&gt; can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease\"&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/a&gt; are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children, because it is associated with &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_respiratory_tract_infection\"&gt;lower respiratory tract infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-Ecology-3\"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Home fireplaces have caused fatal &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning\"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-10\"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/wood-smoke-and-your-health\"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The smoke from wood burning is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles (also called particle pollution, particulate matter, or PM). In addition to particle pollution, wood smoke contains several toxic air pollutants including: benzene, formaldehyde, acrolein, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://heart.org/\"&gt;Heart.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685524/\"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Particle and Fibre Toxicology&lt;/em&gt; found exposure to wood smoke causes the arteries to become stiffer, which raises the risk of dangerous cardiac events. For pregnant women, a &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253313\"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt; connected wood smoke exposure to a higher risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which include preeclampsia and gestational high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: I thought that this would be a good YSK since it is the winter holidays, and a wood fire is anchored in our mind as a part of a picture-perfect holiday evening. But the truth is that they are completely awful, and many of us in modern society are still completely naïve to this fact. Just like led-based paint, asbestos, and smoking around children, it needs to be on its way out. Some states are already offering tax incentives to replace old fireplaces. Please just use an alternative method of heating if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
