Especially when you sort them on your computer by name, date or size since the photos from your phone will have similar names, relatively similar sizes and a certain way of doing date notations. </p>\n\n<p>Oh, and you can switch on Mature content over there as well for what it&#39;s worth, it&#39;s disabled by default.
