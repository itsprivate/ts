It is meant to disarm the argument that individual action is futile because of the large impact of companies by showing how one specific statistic is commonly misinterpreted.</p>\n\n<p>In light of the many recent extreme wheather events around the world people have cited this number to deflect calls to take action against climate change away from individuals onto companies. While companies must be held accountable every one of us has the ability and needs to contribute to lessen the effects of climate change.</p>\n\n<p>The 71 % number shows up in the „<em>CDP Carbon Majors Report 2017</em>“ by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a non-profit that discloses information on environmental impact [1]. The report was published on July 10th 2017 [2] and The Guardian wrote an article titled „<em>Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says</em>“ the same day [3]. I believe this to be the souce of the above claim.</p>\n\n<p>The Carbon Majors Report specifically aims at fossil fuel investors [4, p. 2] and the 100 companies in question are the 100 largest producers of fossil fuels. They look at fossil fuel emissions as the sum of two things [5, p. 3] :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All fossil fuels a company uses in the <strong>extraction and production of fossil fuels</strong> (Scope 1 emissions)</li>\n<li>Emissions from the „<strong>use of sold products</strong>“, meaning the emissions from the use of the manufactured fossil fuels. This typically represents &gt; 90 % of all emissions of a company. (Scope 3 Category 11 emissions)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since this is all about fossil fuel companies the „use of sold products“ includes the fuel your car burns.</p>\n\n<p>The 71 % number refers to the sum of CO2 emissions of those companies between 1988 and 2015 listed in the „Past accountability“ section of the report [4, p. 8]. This is meant to display the significant contribution of just a few companies, but cannot easily be compared to other emission statistics.</p>\n\n<p>One response to people citing this number here on reddit is that it only refers to <strong>industrial emissions</strong>. This is true, but it is important to look up how the report defines industrial emissions before comparing this to other statistics. According to the accompanying methodology report industrial greenhouse gas emissions include <strong>all man-made greenhouse gasses except carbon dioxide relating to land-use change, and methane deriving from farming, landfills, and other non-industrial sources.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The full report (16 pages) can be <a href=\"https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1501833772\">read here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The methodology report (11 pages) can be <a href=\"https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/979/original/Carbon-Majors-Database-2017-Method.pdf\">read here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset including all numbers and company names (1 excel file in a zip folder) can be <a href=\"https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/978/original/Carbon-Majors-Database-2017-Datasets.zip\">downloaded here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us\">https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us</a>, accessed 29.07.2021, 16:36 CEST</p>\n\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions\">https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions</a>, accessed 29.07.2021, 16:39 CEST</p>\n\n<p>[3] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change\">https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change</a>, accessed 29.07.2021, 16:40 CEST</p>\n\n<p>[4] Griffin, P.
