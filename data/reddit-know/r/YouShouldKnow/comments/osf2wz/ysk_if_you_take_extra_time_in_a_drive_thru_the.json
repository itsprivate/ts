Depending on the store, they are often unreasonable and impossible to maintain, to &quot;promote more productivity&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, this means that customers who read the menu, don&#39;t pull away fast enough, or generally spend more than 90 seconds (total) in the drive thru, can be a cause of a lot of stress on cashiers. </p>\n\n<p>As anyone who&#39;s worked customer service can tell you, managers often make life much harder. This standard was a huge problem when I worked a drive thru a few years ago. Threats of being written up or fired over a car that took two minutes to leave the store from the time it pulled to the speaker is ridiculous, but sadly also a daily occurrence. And the poor customer who just needed to read the menu has no idea that maybe <em>they</em> were the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back and lost that person their job.</p>\n\n<p>What you can do: if you don&#39;t know what you want, go inside if you&#39;re able. They&#39;ll be trying to get your food almost as quickly, but they won&#39;t get in trouble. You&#39;ll also have a much easier time making special requests or instructions. </p>\n\n<p>If you really can&#39;t go inside, look it up. Figure out what you want before arriving. Streamlining the process will come back around when all the employees love you for making their jobs easier.</p>\n\n<p>And, please, don&#39;t verbally abuse the cashiers like every other customer. You&#39;re not above them. If you want to be treated like royalty, fast food isn&#39;t the place the do it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A lot of the comments seem to be about this similar point. No, none of this is the customer&#39;s responsibility. Yes, it&#39;s a horribly flawed system. Still, that doesn&#39;t stop that cashier from learning what an anxiety attack is at their first job</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
