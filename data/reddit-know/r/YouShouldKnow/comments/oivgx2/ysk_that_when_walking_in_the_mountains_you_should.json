Too many tourists take a wrong path or lose their path or go off the path. Too many tourists get lost, get hurt and need to be rescued. It can be hard, even in perfect weather conditions, to find your way. </p>\n\n<p>A map is a small cost with a potentially high impact, it could save your life. It also makes it easier to predict how difficult the hike will be. And in each case, it&#39;s a nice souvenir and memory of your beautiful walks in the mountains. </p>\n\n<p>Pro tip: buy the map locally. Sometimes maps are outdated, so be sure to have one that is up to date. (Routes can change due to weather conditions or rockfalls.) </p>\n\n<p>Enjoy nature, but do it respectfully and safely!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
