Here&#39;s some of my favourite Soviet films available at the channel:</p>\n\n<p>Stalker (1979):\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRDYpCmMcM&amp;t=715s\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRDYpCmMcM&amp;t=715s</a></p>\n\n<p>The mirror (1975):\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZhXm02kN0\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZhXm02kN0</a></p>\n\n<p>(Everything made by Andrei Tarkovsky really)</p>\n\n<p>Come and see (1985):\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UkkJZweYaLI&amp;t=49s\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UkkJZweYaLI&amp;t=49s</a></p>\n\n<p>Kin-Dza-Dza  (1986):\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EYHv8eJrW2Y\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EYHv8eJrW2Y</a></p>\n\n<p>Cranes are flying (1957):\n<a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OccZQmxKac\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OccZQmxKac</a></p>\n\n<p>WHY YSK Finding legal ways to watch your favorite Soviet films is at times impossible, but Mosfilm studio has slowly been making their films easily accessible on YouTube for ten years.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just found out YouTube has put ads in the middle of some films. Just a year ago the films only had one ad in the beginning... Reason i didn&#39;t find out is i got YouTube premium</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
