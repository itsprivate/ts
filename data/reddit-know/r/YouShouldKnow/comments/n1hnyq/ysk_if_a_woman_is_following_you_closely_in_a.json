If it weren't for my girlfriend noticing I likely wouldn't of noticed when it happened to me today. I was getting a Red Bull at the market, and a young girl came very close to me with who I thought was her boyfriend. I don't pay much attention, and move out of their way because I figured they wanted to get to the drinks in front of me. I then walk 10 feet over to a cooler to get some salami motz rolls. And again, the girl is right by my side. It still didn't click with me until my girlfriend whispered in my ear that this guy is stalking her. Apparently my girlfriend overheard him ask her how old she is, and she said \"I'm in High school\" and him saying \"Let's get a coffee\". So I stood right there and didn't say a word to either of them, until the guy ran off to the other side of the store. I watched the guy from there on, and made sure the girl wasn't being followed by him afterwards and all was well. I will always notice the signs from here on out, and I hope you all will take notice too.",
