The next time you need to move a cart of stuff around, step back and look at it. Which end looks like it&#39;s probably heavier? Make sure that end is in the back when you move it. <strong>Why YSK:</strong> With the lighter load at the front, a cart/dolly will be able to roll over cracks, bumps, and other obstructions <em>much</em> more easily. With the weight at the front, a small obstruction can easily bring the whole thing to a dead stop.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Similarly, <em>load</em> the cart with this idea in mind. At the grocery store, put the 12-pack of beverages and other heavy items/bags at the back of the cart, and toilet paper, chips, and other light bags/items toward the front. Your trip to the car in the beat-up parking lot will go much more smoothly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
