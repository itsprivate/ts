  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: Credit cards have really high interest rates, often that are variable depending on your credit status, payment history, and spending habits. The minimum payment is mostly designed to cover interest on the purchases, with very small amount going toward principle. If you view your credit card statement, you will find a table that shows how long it will take to pay off the card if you just pay the minimum, and it will also show how much you should pay each month in order to have the card paid off in 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<p>I currently have a credit card with a balance of $1,511.06 and an interest rate of 21.99%. According to my credit card statement, if I make the minimum payment of $43.00 every month, it will take me NINE YEARS to pay off the remaining balance, and I will have spent $3,110 by the end of it.</p>\n\n<p>But, according to my statement, if I make a monthly payment of $58.00, it will only take me three years to pay off the remaining balance, and I will have spent $2,078 by the end of it, for a savings of $1,032.</p>\n\n<p>As credit card balances are higher, of course, this will mean your payment requirement in order to pay off the card in three years&#39; time will be higher per month. But you can always find the sweet spot between the minimum and the 3-year amount if you&#39;re not able to afford the 3-year amount. Either way, folks - NEVER PAY ONLY THE MINIMUM!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Y’all can stop commenting “you should pay your balance off every month!!!” No shit. That’s not who this is for. This advice is not for people in a financial position to pay off their cards every month. This is the case for millions of Americans. Spare me the most obvious financial advice which comes with a tinge of shaming, and let’s work to get people real solutions to the problems they face.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
