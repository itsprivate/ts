There is evidence that about half of autistic people who go through ABA experience PTSD as a result of the process, which is founded on the concept of desensitizing autistic kids to make them appear “normal” (source linked at the end).</p>\n\n<p>The foundation of ABA is that autistic kids must be “shaped” into people, and “non-autistic” behaviors are rewarded with treats, similar to dog training. This model of operant conditioning does two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>it only impacts behavior, and not communication—ironic, considering autism is a disability of communication, and thus ignores the root of what autistic people need accommodations with. </p></li>\n<li><p>it teaches kids that all that matters is the needs of those around them, and not their own. By being punished or ignored for expressing their own needs, they are discouraged from having autonomy and learn that any attempts at self-advocacy are unacceptable. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some programs also still use shock-therapy, which has been denounced by the UN as torture. (Side note: if you haven’t heard of the Judge Rotenberg Center, please look it up. It’s appalling.) But even “modern” ABA centers use the same foundation, which can still have harmful consequences. </p>\n\n<p>Much more safe and effective therapies are occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, which are tailored to individuals and are intended to promote autonomy and connect patients to necessary accommodations. </p>\n\n<p>Resources to learn more, because I barely covered it:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AIA-08-2017-0016/full/html\">https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AIA-08-2017-0016/full/html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2019.1641258\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2019.1641258</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29579\">https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29579</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tania.co.za/non-speaking-autistics-thoughts-on-aba/\">https://tania.co.za/non-speaking-autistics-thoughts-on-aba/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://neuroclastic.com/2019/03/28/invisible-abuse-aba-and-the-things-only-autistic-people-can-see/\">https://neuroclastic.com/2019/03/28/invisible-abuse-aba-and-the-things-only-autistic-people-can-see/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sy4YrUGRk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sy4YrUGRk&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://awnnetwork.org/my-thoughts-on-aba/\">https://awnnetwork.org/my-thoughts-on-aba/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://therapistndc.org/therapy/applied-behavior-analysis-aba/\">https://therapistndc.org/therapy/applied-behavior-analysis-aba/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
