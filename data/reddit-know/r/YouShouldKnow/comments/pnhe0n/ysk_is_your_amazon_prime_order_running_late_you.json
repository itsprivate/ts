It’s normally a $5 credit, but I’ve gotten more than that on larger orders or bigger screwups. It doesn’t work for “free” Amazon - only on Amazon Prime orders. Also, the credit can only be applied to orders sold by and shipped from Amazon directly (no 3rd party sellers). The credits don’t expire.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: it puts money back in your pocket (assuming you plan to continue using Amazon Prime in the future), and it’s not unethical in the slightest bit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
