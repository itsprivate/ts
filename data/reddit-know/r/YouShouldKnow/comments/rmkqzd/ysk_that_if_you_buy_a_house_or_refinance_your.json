  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-depending on your state&amp;#39;s public real estate records and laws, predatory companies may be able to see whenever your new deed or mortgage is filed into public record when you purchase a property or refinance a mortgage. They have algorithms set up to comb through newly filed public records and automatically send mailers to every new homeowner or newly refinanced borrower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-these predatory companies will spam mail you with offers to send copies of your documents for an exorbitant price which you can otherwise get for free or very inexpensively&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-(by the way, other predatory companies will spam mail you with life insurance offers to pay off your new mortgage (even if you refinance) if you die. I just refinanced and got no less than 12 mailers across 2 weeks.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-you should never pay any 3rd party company for copies of your deed and mortgage if you buy or refinance a house. Your title company should send copies to you free of charge or for a few dollars. You can also obtain them from the local public record authority for a small charge compared to the insane fees charges by the predatory mail companies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is so insidious because most people don&amp;#39;t know how real estate records work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing illegal about what these companies do, but it&amp;#39;s very unethical. It costs them 50 cents to mail you a letter, makes you think you need to get the service from them, and if you give them hundreds of dollars for their &amp;quot;service&amp;quot; then they just made 99.9% profit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need any paperwork after your closing, contact your title company, bank, insurance company, or whatever service provider you&amp;#39;ve already engaged. Don&amp;#39;t fall victim to the public record profiteers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you need life insurance to pay off your mortgage if you die-- don&amp;#39;t buy it from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
