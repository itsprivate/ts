If I say something factually wrong in an example, it’s because I literally made it up.</p>\n\n<p>I see this a lot and it really bothers me.  If someone has an argument on say skin care that goes “hydroelectric massage therapy is helpful”, and you ask for a study, you will NOT get a study that says “hydroelectric massage therapy is helpful”.  </p>\n\n<p>You might find a study that says “hydroelectric massage therapy opens skin pores” or “hydroelectric massage therapy I increased skin radiance”, but the judgement call of “helpful” will never be there.</p>\n\n<p>On a similar note, let’s say you are arguing about dog diets and you want a source for “Beef improves an active dogs life”.  You may get a source that says “dogs absorb more protein from beef than any other meat” or “dogs who consume beef are more likely to run faster”.</p>\n\n<p>A smart person may recognize that protein is important to an active lifestyle and dogs running faster is a sign of athleticism.  But those are your conclusions.  The authors of the study will NEVER draw those extrapolations or logical conclusions that it improves their active life.  They are ONLY concerned with proving protein intake or correlations between diet and speed.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK:  This why YSK comes in 2 parts: </p>\n\n<p>First off, if you see a study that draws a logical conclusion or makes value judgement, it’s almost certainly BS.  The only people who would publish a “study” claiming hydroelectric therapy is good are the people what want you to by their hydroelectric therapy brush.  Any scientist who cares about the process will provide you the facts in a pure way and let you make those conclusions/judgements yourself.</p>\n\n<p>But for a second reason, if you give a source and someone says “AkCtuaLLy it doesn’t say dogs are more active”, that should be a clear sign the person you are arguing with doesn’t understand the basics of the scientific process.  You’re not going to get an educated reading of the science so you should probably reconsider if it’s worth replying.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
