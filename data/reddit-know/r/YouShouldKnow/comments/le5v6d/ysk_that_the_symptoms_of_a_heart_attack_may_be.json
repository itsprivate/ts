I had waves of tightness dead center in my chest that would come and go every few minutes. It was a burning feeling. It was lower on my sternum than I’d have thought. I had never had a heart attack nor indigestion so naturally, I assumed it was the latter and my research online convinced me it was. \n\nI assumed it would have been a sharper pain on my upper arm/shoulder and a sharper, more acute pain closer to where we mistakenly generally consider our heart to be...upper left chest. In fact, my symptoms were almost line-by-line identical to that of heartburn or indigestion ... it wasn’t, and the difference can be life or death. \n\nMy arms hurt but it was more of a burning pain on the back of both arms. Vomiting and sweating followed a few hours into it which was the big red flag...the ambulance not far behind the vomiting. The rest was a blur until the ICU but I do remember some of it. \n\nI made the common mistake of equating the symptoms to heartburn or indigestion and should have gone to the ER 10 hours sooner and therefore found myself VERY lucky to have made it through. \n\nPLS don’t fuck around.
