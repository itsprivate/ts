Keep grass short, dispose of leaves \n\nShort grass exposes ticks, eggs, and nymphs to the sun which can kill them, it also makes it difficult for them to attach to critters since they like to climb tall grass in order to do so. Also keep grass clippings and leaves in a bag instead of out on the lawn, leaving the clippings provides ticks cover. Alternatively you can compost clippings. \n\n2. Make a mulch border around wooded areas. \n\nCreate a 3ft wide moat of mulch around forested or wooded areas of your lawn. You could also potentially use gravel but mulch is cheaper. “Use mulch made from broad, dry wood chips or bark, not the damp, shredded variety, which creates exactly the kind of cool, damp conditions ticks love” (consumer report) \n\n\n3. Get rid of clutter they can hide under/in. \n\nThings like old tires, mattresses, tarps, etc. \n\n4. Tick tubes.\n\nWARNING: permethrin is toxic to cats and fish, don’t use if you have a cat or live near a pond or lake \n\nThese are tubes of cotton balls soaked in usually permethrin or met52. Mice and rats take the balls back to their nest and get coated in the stuff  which kills ticks and prevents more from latching onto them. \n\n5. Deter certain animals from entering your yard. \n\nRodents and deer are big tick reservoirs so have high fencing, organize wood piles, throw out your bird feeder, and seriously throw out your bird feeder, or keep it far from your house/ in the woods   \n\n6. Encourage certain animals in your yard.\n\nThis isn’t a conventional recommendation but there are some animals that love eating ticks. These include chickens and ground birds like turkeys, possums which you can build little dens for so they don’t dig into your house, and foxes or other predators that eat rodents or other tick reservoirs. \n\n\n\nNote: there is no way to 100% get rid of ticks with the materials and methods we have now.
