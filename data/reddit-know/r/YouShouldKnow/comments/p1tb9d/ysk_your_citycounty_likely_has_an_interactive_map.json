It is a good idea to occasionally check your local register, especially if you have children, thinking of moving or hiring someone to do work at your house. The map denotes registered offenders, repeat offenders and violent offenders. You can also search specific names or addresses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not information for you to use for some weird vigilante justice. That is what the criminal justice system is for. Inform yourself, inform your neighbors and coworkers but do not maliciously engage these people merely to provoke them.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link for the US Department of Justice website: <a href=\"https://www.nsopw.gov/\">https://www.nsopw.gov/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
