Each website (provided it's been reviewed) is marked with a rating from A to F (A being the highest and F being the grade I got in mathematics), depending on how safe or sketchy the Terms of Service are. It highlights the notable parts of the ToS and gives each point either a thumbs up or a thumbs down, again, depending on how safe or sketchy that part is.
