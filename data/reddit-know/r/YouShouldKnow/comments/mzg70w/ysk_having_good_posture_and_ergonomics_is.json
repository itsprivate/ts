Hopefully a lot of people know this already, but if you're like I was a few months ago, you might think of posture like some people think of diet, sort of like \"this won't affect me until I'm older, so I don't need to worry about it yet\" (not that that's a good mindset either).\n\nSome things that can happen from poor posture are degenerated discs, upper-crossed syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome (this can result in blot clots and aneurysms, no lie), arthritis, all kinds of pinched nerves, fatigue, and many other painful conditions that can require physical therapy, medications, and even surgery.  I couldn't find an academic article about this that fits well, but here's something [from the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/posture-align-yourself-for-good-health/art-20269950) about it.\n\nTo prevent these problems, you should of course have a proper ergonomic setup for work/gaming/whatever you're doing. Sitting on a yoga ball or using a standing desk is a good idea. When driving, try to adjust your seat properly. Even when standing, walking around, and relaxing on your couch try to have your shoulder blades down and together, your shoulders back, and your neck back so that your ears align with your shoulders. Also, this is slightly unrelated, but drinking enough water everyday [helps keep your spinal discs healthy](https://cospineandjoint.com/2018/11/hydration-important-spinal-health/).\n\nI'm not in the medical field, so anyone who knows more about this is of course welcome to correct me on stuff. I just thought I'd spread the word in case it can help anyone prevent their own problems. I for one didn't know all this before, and now I'm sitting here, only in my 20s, with tingly, tired arms and a heating pad on my shoulder because I had bad ergonomics.\n\nBe well everyone!",
