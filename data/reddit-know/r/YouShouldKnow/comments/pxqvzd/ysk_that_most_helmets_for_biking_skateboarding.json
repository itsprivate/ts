Of course the more the helmet is used the more it will deteriorate, so one rule for all does not work here, but three years is a good guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Replace your bike helmets after every big fall.\nReplace your skateboard/ski/snowboard helmet after a few big falls.\nSomeone let me know about motorcycle helmets, I assume you wanna replace that after 1 fall.\nReplace your helmets every 3 years even if you have no falls or minor falls.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Some great extra notes from the comments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bike helmets are designs for 1 fall.</li>\n<li>Sturdier helmets like for skating or snowboarding can take a few more falls.</li>\n<li>Dropping your helmet is the same as falling on it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://epsindustry.org/other-applications/safety-devices\">http://epsindustry.org/other-applications/safety-devices</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://off.road.cc/content/feature/when-should-you-replace-your-bicycle-helmet-1280\">https://off.road.cc/content/feature/when-should-you-replace-your-bicycle-helmet-1280</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
