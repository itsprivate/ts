Provided your plumbing doesn&#39;t suck, you should almost never get clogs or slow draining in a modern plumbing system. If it does suck, getting your piping redone correctly up to your main stack can drastically improve that.</p>\n\n<p>Even if it doesn&#39;t clog your drains it makes it&#39;s way to the water treatment plant and can often clog and impede their pipes and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, do what old age homes do in their lobby bathrooms: put little trashcans with secure lids with a bag under the sink or some out of the way location and change it often.</p>\n\n<p>Or just get a bidet. Give your brown eyed monster the proper bath it needs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
