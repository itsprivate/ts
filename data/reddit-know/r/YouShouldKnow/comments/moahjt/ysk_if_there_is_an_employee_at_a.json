The customer actually wanted to speak to upper management about it which could really have gotten the employee in serious trouble. To be fair the employee didn't deny it and the write up was little more than a slap on the wrist, but now the customer definitely wasn't going to get anything and we were watching for her in case she tried to do it again with another employee.",
