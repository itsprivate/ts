While I do like the fact that it gives police an edge against real criminals, it could also be abused to frighten innocent individuals in an attempt to force a confession. Also, it is used by some companies and government organizations when they are hiring, which makes absolutely no sense since they are far less than accurate and they know that. Even the inventor of the original polygraph machine said it wasn&#39;t a lie detector and would be vocal about how it&#39;s bullshit. It only has around a 40% success rate when it comes to &quot;spotting lies&quot;. It has an even lower success rate when you take into account people with anxiety, or people on drugs. Additionally, pathological liars and psychopaths usually pass polygraphs with flying colors. And people can be trained to pass the polygraph, you can alter results just by thinking stressful thoughts and clenching your butthole (seriously). Police know that it&#39;s BS and tend to stick to using it as an interrogation tool, but fuck that shit if a company tries to get you to take a polygraph to apply for a job.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
