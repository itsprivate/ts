Companies like us to push credits so you have to stay with us and give us another chance.\n\nHowever, if you want a refund instead of a credit. Most of the time we can give it to you. But you have to be the one to say the word refund **after** we say the word credit. This is called pushback and we have the authority to act on it. And please do so calmly and politely. Because as an agent we want you to leave happy. It's the job and makes us feel good.\n\nWhat we hate is a reply like \"I'm unhappy with your company but I suppose I have to take the credit then fine.\" After that, we will eternally think \"No! say the word refund!\" Because then we are in an awkward spot. Where we know we could do better but we can't.\n\nAnd if customer service isn't allowed to give you a refund after you ask for it. Then they just are not allowed. It's company policy. Speaking to a supervisor won't change it. From our side, there is no reason we'd want to deny you. What the person you are talking to cares about is how you answer the survey about how we did not about our company's money.",
