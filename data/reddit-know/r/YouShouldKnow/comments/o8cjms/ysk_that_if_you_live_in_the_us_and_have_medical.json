I can&#39;t tell you how many times we&#39;ve had patients show up at our clinic, only to be told we are not in-network with their insurance. This is usually due to a few senarios:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The patient flat out did not tell us what insurance plan they had before arriving.</li>\n<li>The patient told us they had &quot;Medicare&quot; but did not inform us/did not know that they had opted into a certain Medicare Advantage plan.</li>\n<li>The patient did not realize that their <em>insert provider specialty here</em> coverage is through a &quot;carve out&quot; plan that is different that their primary medical insurance (e.g., they have BlueCross BlueShield insurance but the mental health benefits are through a &quot;carve out&quot; plan with United Healthcare).</li>\n<li>The patient called their insurance company and they told the patient our clinic was in-network, but the insurance company had the wrong information. <em>Always call the provider&#39;s office and confirm they are in-network with your insurance.</em></li>\n<li> The patient has two insurances but only gave the provider&#39;s office one of them. THIS ONE IS ESPECIALLY BAD BECAUSE WE USUALLY DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL AFTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED, MEANING YOU ARE STUCK WITH THE FEES!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After most of these scenarios (except #5), patients have only two options: pay a high self pay rate or don&#39;t be seen and seek care elsewhere. Yes, it&#39;s a broken healthcare system and often the rules are unfair/don&#39;t make sense, but that&#39;s why I always encourage patients to be informed and self-reliant when it comes to their medical insurance. In my experience that is the best way to avoid unnecessary out of pocket fees. Definitely don&#39;t expect your insurance company or medical care providers to go out of their way to inform you, because in my experience, they will not, and you will be stuck with an unnecessary bill.</p>\n\n<p>Happy to address questions and concerns in the comments section!</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Medical billing is extremely complicated and tedious, so even after 3 years as a medical biller, my knowledge is still imperfect.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
