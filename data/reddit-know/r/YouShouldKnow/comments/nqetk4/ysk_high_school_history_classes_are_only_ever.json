This is true even of those curriculums that focus almost entirely on national history (history pertaining to the nation you currently reside in). There's simply too much there to squeeze it all in. Nuance has to be almost completely scrapped for the sake of brevity and clarity. Entire events have to be regulated to a single footnote or not even mentioned at all. It's unfortunate but unavoidable.\n\nIf you have an actual interest in history, be it a general interest or just about a specific event, then the onus is entirely on you to learn more about it. Go to a bookstore or browse the Amazon ebook store, check out the history section and pick something that appeals to you. If you prefer audiobooks or podcasts then there are plenty of those as well to choose from. You might even be amazed to realize just how fascinating history can be when you're free to choose what subjects you want. You could even try branching out to other countries or parts of the world and learning about their histories as well. There's really no end to the subject and you can still learn new things about something even after years of learning about it.\n\nSo, keep that in mind next time someone mentions something in history that you were completely unaware of. it's probably not entirely the fault of your educational system. Also, try not to get pissed at foreigners for not knowing much about your nation's history, they probably have plenty of their own stuff to cover and it's even more absurd to expect them to cover yours as well (even if your nations share some history).\n\nWhy YSK: Human history is a very big subject and it can be easy to not realize that when you don't know much about it to begin with. Knowing and understanding it better can lead to a person having a far better grasp on why the world is the way it is.",
