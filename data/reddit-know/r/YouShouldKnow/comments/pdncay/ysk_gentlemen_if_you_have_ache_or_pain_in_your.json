It was the longest week of my life. I was sure that, that&#39;s it!</p>\n\n<p>So the ultrasound time came along on a Friday. The technician wasn&#39;t as nice as my doctor and basically scaned me with a straight face and said that the radiologist will be in touch with my doctor on Monday. So another horrible long weekend.</p>\n\n<p>My doctor contacted me with my results after what seemed like months. Turns out that I have &quot;varicocele&quot; which is a varicose vein in my testicle. It&#39;s can cause infertility but I have my family now so I don&#39;t really care about that.Thr relief was overwhelming, It actually broke down in tears!</p>\n\n<p>I could have saved myself a lot of anxiety if I had just gotten checked out over a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>Gentlemen if it doesn&#39;t feel right, get it checked!! If it&#39;s bad news, the earlier it&#39;s found the better... Or it could be something like my situation. X</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
