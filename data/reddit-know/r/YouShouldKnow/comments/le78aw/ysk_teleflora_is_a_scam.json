Tell your grandma this as well.\n\nI ordered from them a few months ago, and I was completely ghosted by them. I’ve been looking into them ever since and this is what I found.\n\nLet me start with the customer reviews on consumer affairs;\n\n[https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/teleflora.html](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/teleflora.html)\n\n1 star across the board.\n\nBut they're not just a bad company, no.\n\nHere's the scam;\n\nThey walk you through placing an order. They talk up 'their product' and get as much money out of you as possible.\n\nYou think to yourself \"great, I just ordered beautiful flowers!\"\n\nBut the thing is, they don't have designers. They don't have a shop.\n\nThey call shops in the area you want to deliver to and they pawn off their orders on those shops.\n\nThe shop actually making the order gets a fraction of what they would of have you called them directly. Teleflora gets the rest. The shop making the flowers can't just give flowers away for free. If the shop is getting paid $20 for a $60 order, you're getting $20 worth of flowers. That $40 goes straight into telefloaral's pockets. It was leeched away.\n\nIn addition, because they don't have a stock, your order is limited to another company's stock. They'll promise you a nice blue vase, but if the store they pawn the order onto has no blue vase, you'll get whatever they have.\n\n9 times out of 10, all of the shops in an area will be so sick of these scam calls that they don't accept the order. That means you paid for flowers you won't receive.\n\nInstead, you should find the number of a local shop or a chain of local shops in the area you want to deliver to. Verify the shops exist on google maps. Have an address of the shop on hand. Order directly.\n\nNote, sometimes (especially because of recent events) shops use from home workers to process online orders. For chain shops, they generally have a central customer service number that takes orders for the whole chain. Although these numbers are legit and safe, this can look similar to what Teleflora does. If you get a remote worker, and you're worried about it, ask to be transferred to the actual shop and verify the shop address on google.\n\nStay safe.\n\nEdit; Teleflora isn’t the only company that does this, there are several others. But they’re one of the biggest and most well known.",
