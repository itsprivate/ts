It takes only 3 years for the forest to become completely independent, and only requires 9 x 13 feet and 8 hours of sunlight per day. The method is successful even in depleted and degraded soils, and has been tested in industrial and port conditions. The first field trials have shown that the Miyawaki forests, which are closer to what would exist in the absence of human activity, grow quickly and generally showed perfect ecological resilience.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the personal benefits include lower costs for air-conditioning, significant noise and dust reduction, flood risk reduction, extreme weather protection for adjacent structures, and pollinator and wildlife support. In addition, the density of the forests prevent human interference, so it acts as a pretty good fence. You can do it yourself, with compost and corn husks, requiring only light weeding and daily watering to support it. It&#39;s easy, it looks good, it&#39;s access to free lumber long-term for craftsmen, it&#39;s sequestering carbon, and it reduces the heat island effect.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Miyawaki\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Miyawaki</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://can-plant.ca/blog/crafting-tiny-fast-growing-forests-with-the-miyawaki-method.htm\">https://can-plant.ca/blog/crafting-tiny-fast-growing-forests-with-the-miyawaki-method.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.in/content/how-to-use-miyawaki-method-grow-mini-forest-minimal-space-home-garden/\">https://www.architecturaldigest.in/content/how-to-use-miyawaki-method-grow-mini-forest-minimal-space-home-garden/</a></p>\n\n<p>Since there have been a great deal of wildfires, and flooding, along with sluggishness in addressing the issue, this is a small fast way to help yourself and the planet in the meantime. If you have the space, and don&#39;t need a HOA approval, consider installing one where your useless time-draining lawn used to be!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
