By using a spreadsheet to compare overall costs, you can choose the most cost-effective plan that your employer offers. Sometimes that choice even bucks conventional wisdom like &quot;HSAs are only for young, healthy, single people&quot; and &quot;Definitely choose the most expensive plan if you are going to have a baby.&quot; The right choice is specific to the plans offered by your employer!</p>\n\n<p>In  the US, the Open Enrollment period at the beginning of November is the only time during the year you can make changes to your health insurance  plan (barring certain life events). Many companies offer several plans  with different cost structures, and doing a thorough comparison can save  you more money than you would think. Many times, the most expensive plan is NOT the best choice, even if you know you will have a lot of  medical costs.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a spreadsheet template you can save a copy of. Fill in the outlined section at the top with the various plans offered by your/your spouse&#39;s  employer: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18kLItQPl3DVFN4TnKJrA4ZUurWirj5IP1hooipTiY7g/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18kLItQPl3DVFN4TnKJrA4ZUurWirj5IP1hooipTiY7g/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>Look  at your company&#39;s offerings to find the monthly premium, deductible,  coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum. If your company offers a  High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and has an HSA (health savings  account) contribution they add, include that, too.</p>\n\n<p>Once you&#39;ve replaced my sample numbers with your own, look at the graph to  see how much you will pay in total (premiums, deductible, total  out-of-pocket costs) to choose the right plan for you or your family.</p>\n\n<p>I  often see posts on Reddit that HSA plans can be very cost-effective for young, single people who don&#39;t have many medical expenses.  Additionally, many assume that if they know they will incur large costs  (e.g. major surgery, having a baby) during the year, then they should choose the most expensive plan that covers the most. <em>In many cases, that is not true!</em>  High-deductible health plans often have such low premiums that they  come out less expensive overall than traditional &quot;gold/platinum&quot; PPO  plans, even if you incur tens of thousands of dollars in medical  expenses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
