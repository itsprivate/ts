Next, you lay them on their side so they can breathe and get rid of foam because that can obstruct breathing. Finally, calmly comfort them and help them breathe whilst the seizure runs its course. On average a seizure lasts between 30-2:30 seconds but if the seizure persists for over 5 minutes seek immediate medical attention as this circumstance can be a serious problem.",
