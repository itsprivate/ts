If something goes wrong (which it does), and you are caught in the crossfire, you will die. </p>\n\n<p>Rule #1: <strong>The semi always wins. Always.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Rule #2: When on the freeway, keep your distance from the semi. As a rule of thumb, if you can read the license plate, you&#39;re too close. </p>\n\n<p>Rule #3: When passing, do so as quickly as possible. If they are passing you, slow down. If you are passing them, speed up. Driving next to a semi is one of the most dangerous places you can be for multiple reasons, and therefore is a place you don&#39;t want to be. </p>\n\n<p>Rule #4: When lane-shifting in front of the semi, make sure that you do so at a safe distance. If you shift too close, you may scare the driver, and they may swerve to avoid you. In general, if you can see both of the semi&#39;s headlights in your side mirror, you&#39;re at a safe distance to move. </p>\n\n<p>Rule #5: The semi has very large blind spots. Don&#39;t be in them. They can&#39;t check their blind spots very well, so a lane shift may very well shove you off the road. </p>\n\n<p>Rule #6: Sometimes, semis will need to take &quot;Wide turns&quot;, which essentially means that they can&#39;t use the rightmost lane to take a right turn-they need to move one over. If you are at an intersection and have a semi next to you, don&#39;t start moving as soon as the light changes-wait to see if the semi makes the first move, and confirm where they are going before making yours.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
