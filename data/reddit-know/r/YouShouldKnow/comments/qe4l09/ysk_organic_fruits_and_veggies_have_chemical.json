  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: Organic produce can include the same chemical compounds as conventional produce sprayed with synthetic pesticides (but at more variable rates), and needs to be rinsed to avoid ingesting.</p>\n\n<p>In the US, organic produce can also have chemical residue, but the difference is organics can only be treated with certain classes of chemicals. Most traditional pesticides are synthetically produced chemical compounds, and these aren&#39;t allowed to be applied to organic crops. Organic crops can have the same chemical compounds applied, if they&#39;re not produced synthetically, but are produced by a bacteria that &#39;poops&#39; out the same chemical (along with many additional chemical compounds). These safe, beneficial bacteria are sprayed on the plants or soil. The chemical compound is exactly the same, but because it&#39;s a biological pesticide, it&#39;s okay to apply. Chemical products like pesticides are regulated much, much more heavily than other products.</p>\n\n<p>Chemical applications have to follow a lot of rules, for example,  they usually can&#39;t be applied after flowering, and since the fruit develops from a pollinated flower, it&#39;s really the leaves and stems that take the chemical load, not the fruit. And vegetables that grow underground like potatoes and onions don&#39;t get exposed.</p>\n\n<p>I have a PhD in an agricultural plant genetics, and have worked in the biological agriculture industry (but don&#39;t anymore). Personally, I don&#39;t worry too much about organic, and believe it&#39;s better to buy local (from a conventional or organic farmer). If the produce has been picked more quickly, it will have a better nutritional profile (higher nutrient and micronutrient levels, greater diversity of flavonoids like carotenoids and anthocyanins, and other antioxidants). </p>\n\n<p>If you want to buy organic, focus on leafy greens and international fruit, especially bananas -- where organic means a better quality of work and life for the workers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
