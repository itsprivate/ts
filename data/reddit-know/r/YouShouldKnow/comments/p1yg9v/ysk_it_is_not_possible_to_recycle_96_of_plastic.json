This 4% can also only be recycled a few times before it becomes useless to recycle.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we MUST adopt sustainable practices,  such as reusing water bottles and paper bags or, ideally, opting for glass water bottles and reusable shopping bags.</p>\n\n<p>The work should not stop here, though. A major component to living a more sustainable lifestyle is <strong>reducing</strong> consumption wherever we can. This does not mean life has to be boring or we have to be hermits. In fact, I am arguing quite the opposite. </p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce, we must restore a sense of community in western society by sharing items. Instead of cluttering up our garage with items we use once per year, we should simply borrow said items from our neighbors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
