I think it's important for these people to know that it's okay.\n\nThe condition is called specific musical anhedonia. it affects anywhere from 3 to 5% of people, about as common as color blindness, yet hardly anyone has ever heard of this condition in the vast majority of people who have it don't know that they do.\n\nIt's a neurological syndrome that can occur either through genetics or as a side effect from brain injury. Through some means or another, the part of the brain associated with music comprehension is not properly connected to the part of the brain associated with reward and pleasure. Most often this occurs in the form of an issue with someone's dopaminergic system, often defective D2 and D3 receptors or interrupted dopamine pathways.\n\nThe result is a person who doesn't have any emotional response to music. As you can imagine, it's sometimes very difficult for this kind of person to fit in with the rest of society, especially considering that despite every culture's differing religions, laws, traditions and languages, all cultures share music, and this is something that these people just can't relate to.\n\nI always felt left out and as though I were missing something as a kid, before I knew what I had and came to terms with it. Loud noises in the background of someone throwing their voice around while they repetitively recite a crappy poem is weird anyways.\n\nYou can read more here:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_anhedonia\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/113/46/E7337",
