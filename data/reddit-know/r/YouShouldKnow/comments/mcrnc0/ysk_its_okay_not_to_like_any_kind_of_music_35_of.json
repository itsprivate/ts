Through some means or another, the part of the brain associated with music comprehension is not properly connected to the part of the brain associated with reward and pleasure. Most often this occurs in the form of an issue with someone's dopaminergic system, often defective D2 and D3 receptors or interrupted dopamine pathways.\n\nThe result is a person who doesn't have any emotional response to music.

Loud noises in the background of someone throwing their voice around while they repetitively recite a crappy poem is weird anyways.\n\nYou can read more here:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_anhedonia\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/113/46/E7337",
