Either spend it on school supplies you need or save it as emergency funds and plan to pay it back into your loans as soon as you can.</p>\n\n<p>*why probably - if you have enough federal/state aid, scholarships, pay out of pocket and a cheap enough school, you might end up paying more then the bill by mistake, like if you pay off the bill before some scholarships go through. If that&#39;s the case, then it is an actual refund and do what you want it - just be smart about it, if you do have loans, put it towards that if you can.</p>\n\n<p>(Edit; *than....oops, I hate english lol)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
