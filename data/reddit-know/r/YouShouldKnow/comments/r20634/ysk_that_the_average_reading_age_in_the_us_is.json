People with a low reading age can be very intelligent. There are many difficulties that people struggle with that can impair their reading age, but doesn&#39;t affect how intelligent they are.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: If you want to get your message across to the widest number of people you <em>have</em> to use simple language, you can&#39;t assume everyone has the same vocabulary.</p>\n\n<p>Being overtly and overly sesquipedalian can make you seem churlish, and alienate your audience. ðŸ˜œ</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
