He gave us a 1/10 JUST for that. Don't be that guy.\n\nThe best thing is to tell them exactly what you're giving them right from the get-go. \"Here's a $20\" or \"I've got a dollar and 15 cents here\" removes any doubts about what money has been exchanged, and prevents issues about money and change down the line.\n\nEdit: Someone made a good point that if you're an employee, you can just state the amount of money the customer gave you, no need to ask them to verify the amount. Saying \"out of a $20\" is fine, and then the customer can correct you if it's wrong. I do that when it's a face-to-face transaction, but in this scenario, the patient was in the far drive-thru lane so I had to make sure he heard me correctly, hence why I needed to phrase it as a question",
