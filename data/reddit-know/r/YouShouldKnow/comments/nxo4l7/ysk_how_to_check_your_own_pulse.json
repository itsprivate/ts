They tout it can detect \"bradycardia, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation\" which all sounds great. Thing is, so can your finger. Bradycardia is a slow heartrate, tachycardia is fast, atrial fibrillation can be felt as irregular beats (the spacing in between beats is variable and no two are the same). So to save yourself some money and to teach a potentially life saving skill, here's how you do it:\n\nTake your index and middle fingers (never use your thumb) and place them gently on either your radial artery, which you can find by starting at the palm side of your index finger, and tracing down in a straight line to your wrist just below your hand, or the carotid artery which is found on either side of your windpipe. You don't have to press hard, just gently enough to feel the pulse. Use a clock or watch or your phone as a timer, and count for 15 seconds. Multiply whatever you get by 4 and that's your heartrate. Pay attention to the rhythm as well.\n\nIf it's within the 60-100 mark, that's considered normal. Granted if you're sitting on the couch and it's 88 you may want to consider investigating. If it's under 60 it's considered bradycardia, over 100 is tachycardia. Take all this in context though, an athlete's heartrate is naturally lower than a normal person's, and if you just brought in groceries it'll be higher than resting. I hope this helps when you just want to do a quick heart checkup!\n\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-check-heart-rate",
