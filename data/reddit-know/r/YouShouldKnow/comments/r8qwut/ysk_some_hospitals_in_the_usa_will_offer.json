Not many people are aware that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; hospitals will offer discounts to your bill. You MUST ASK for these discounts, they aren&amp;#39;t handed out like candy. Some discounts may be applied simply because you asked and were polite in doing so. Other potentially larger discounts may be applied if you can prove your income is relatively low and you are unable to pay in a timely fashion. Generally speaking, some hospitals will prefer to lower your bill and get you to pay that amount rather than send the full bill to collections. You might want to seek out hospitals that offer these discounts as opposed to ones that do not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an anecdote, I had low wages and a hospital bill a number of years ago. I asked for a discount and got 45% off the bill, as well as 35% off any future bills for a whole year. I did have sign a document attesting to my wages. I had insurance at the time but the bill was slightly less than my deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
