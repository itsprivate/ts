Probably it is the middle aged experienced me talking, but nobody really cares about your overall appearance if you shower and brush your teeth regularly. For life we want a guy who is genuinely nice and treats the people who he is supposedly  `superior´ to with compassion and respect. Animals, children, old people. These are the things that truly show ones heart. These are the guys we want to be with for the rest of our life. These are the girls who will be on your side. Who do not give a damn if you go to the gym, and if you do, they will encourage you, and support your hobbies and passions no matter what it may be. Who could care about a belly, or a job that isn’t as successful as you wish you would be? It all comes down to a lionheart and sharing at least some of the same interests. And lifting up your spirit, as much as you lift up her spirit. If you want to hold hand with a woman when you are old and grey just make sure you are not a condescending a-hole, but rather a compassionate, empathetic good guy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
