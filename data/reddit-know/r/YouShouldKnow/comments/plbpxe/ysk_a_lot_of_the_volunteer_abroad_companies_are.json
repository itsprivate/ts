I’ve wanted to travel and even if I had to help out it didn’t seem like a bad way to do it. However the second slide was a 2 minute video of people doing some of the funnest things ever like bungee jumping, scuba diving, building bamboo rafts, seeing animals, and of course hanging out with people of a different color. </p>\n\n<p>They then tried to mention how i would be helping out and some of the ways were planting trees, doing some hikes, having discussions about the locals problems, talking about elephants, and teaching English for 2 days to some students. So in reality a lot of talking and doing a bunch of fun things near locals. </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK \nA lot of people might spend their money thinking that it’s worth it since you’re gonna be helping and having fun. The reality is you’re just going on vacation. If you want to go there plan a vacation on your own that’s cheaper. Or at-least make sure that if you’re gonna help out it is an volunteering company and that it shows in the things you will be doing there. </p>\n\n<p>Also keep it in mind so your friends and family don’t fall into this trap and if they still insist on going then don’t help them financially and have them get a job to pay for their vacation. Because that’s what it is. A vacation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
