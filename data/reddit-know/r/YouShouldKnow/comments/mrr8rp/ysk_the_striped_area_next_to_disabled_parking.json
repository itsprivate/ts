So not only are you potentially blocking access for someone who is disabled but you're also at risk of a hefty fine.  There are some states which have not yet changed their statutes to explicitly cover this but most likely will over time.  Additionally, many cities have adopted the same basic concepts so even if you lack a state law, there may well be a local one.\n\nWhy does this matter?  Many folks who are disabled require extra space to get in and out of their vehicle.  This is true for most who use wheelchairs but it is not limited just to them.  Some folks are simply incapable of squeezing in and out without sufficient space due to their particular physical needs.  Folks who require this access may have to sit in the car until the vehicle blocking their spot can be moved.\n\nBy way of example, here is Washington State's law on the matter: [RCW 46.19.050\\(3\\)](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.19.050):\n\n> (3) **Inaccessible access.** It is a parking infraction, with a monetary penalty of two hundred fifty dollars, for a person to stop, stand, or park in, block, or otherwise make inaccessible the access aisle located next to a space reserved for persons with physical disabilities. In addition to any penalty or fine imposed under this subsection, two hundred dollars must be assessed. The clerk of the court shall report all violations related to this subsection to the department.\n\nNote that the fine is explicitly on top of any fine for parking in a disabled spot without a placard which is itself a $200 fine which *must* be assessed.  So even if you don't care about those who need the disabled parking, trying to save a few minutes finding a parking space may well cost you several hundred dollars.  Regardless, even when not explicitly called out for a separate fine, those striped markings are considered part of the disabled parking spot.",
