Granted I live in Southern California in an area with large swell and strong currents, but the ocean will ALWAYS be unpredictable, no matter how safe it looks. There are so many things that can go wrong that you just cannot predict. When you’re out past where you can touch, you are truly at its mercy. I just wish I could impress on people how easy and how fast a life can be gone when it’s so preventable. Anywhere you see an unguarded beach, there will probably be a guarded one just a quick walk or drive away. Please go to that one. Or at least have someone on the beach, and some sort of flotation device with you, it can save your life! </p>\n\n<p>But even at guarded beaches YSK:</p>\n\n<p>A fist straight up in the air is the signal for guards to help you. Teach this to your friends, your kids, your homies, your random pals on the beach. </p>\n\n<p>You should also know what to do in a rip current, even if you’re at a guarded beach! A rip will take you out into the ocean, but typically only just past the break. It will not drag you all the way out to sea. If you aren’t a strong swimmer, let it carry you out. Honestly. You will not go as far as you think you will, put your fist up and wait for help, do NOT exhaust yourself trying to swim against it. If you’re stuck in rough waves, dive down before they hit you and try to go deeper, rather than shallower, so that you don’t get pulled further in with them. If you are a strong swimmer, swim perpendicular to the rip, parallel to the shore, but again, do not exhaust yourself. </p>\n\n<p>Edit ALSO: If you aren’t a guard with rescue equipment, please do not attempt to rescue someone unless it’s something very simple, like grabbing a kid who couldn’t touch. So many single person drowning turn into multiples because someone put themselves in danger trying to save another person. When someone’s drowning, their first instinct is going to be to grab onto anything above the water, including you. They can and will drag you under. If you do find yourself in this situation, swim down, and away.</p>\n\n<p>Surf and swim safe, go to guarded beaches.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
