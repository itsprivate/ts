However, in large amounts it can cause gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. Chicory root is one of the most common sources of inulin because it&#39;s cheap, abundant, and in powder form can be added to almost anything to boost that food&#39;s total fiber numbers without significantly impacting taste or texture. Everything from cereals to granola bars to fiber gummies and beyond has it these days.</p>\n\n<p>Chicory root at near the bottom of the ingredients list doesn&#39;t worry me. But, when it&#39;s towards the top, I avoid it. Also, don&#39;t assume because you bought a product once and it didn&#39;t have chicory root that it never will. Food manufacturers change up the ingredients subtly all the time and it&#39;s not at all uncommon for me to check a box of cereal I&#39;ve been eating for a long time and suddenly notice it now has it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
