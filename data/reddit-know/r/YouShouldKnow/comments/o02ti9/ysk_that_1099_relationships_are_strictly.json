Speak to a tax professional/attorney and find out what your options are. The IRS will need to make a determination on your classification, so make sure you document all employer activities that indicate tax fraud. Most intentional misclassifications will have a lot of these red flags, making it easier to prove.\n\nNo matter how you report it to the IRS, your employer will be on the hook for half of your Social Security & Medicare taxes.
