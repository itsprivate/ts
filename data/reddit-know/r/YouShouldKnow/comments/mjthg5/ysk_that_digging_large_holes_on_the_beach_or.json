It’s important to cover over any holes being dug each day to prevent wildlife from being trapped overnight.\n\nIf you’re digging a hole on the beach it’s perfectly fine, but people should be mindful of the dangers of unsupported beach sand and how unpredictable it can be. You shouldn’t dig tunnels or ever crawl through one on the beach and you must fill them back in when you’re done.\n\n[Sand Hole Digging Dangers - Maritime and Coastguard Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sand-hole-digging-dangers)",
