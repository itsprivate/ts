It’s pretty clear which one to use for what situation in Spanish, but the all-encompassing “sorry” of English doesn’t portray what “lo siento” does. \n\nReplacing “I’m so sorry” with “I’m so sad that this happened [to you],” (or “I’m heartbroken that you’ve had to experience this loss,” or whatever variation applies to the scenario) communicates sympathy rather than pity, and in my experience leaves the door open for them to expand on the topic if they choose to. For example, when you say “I’m sorry,” some people automatically say “it’s okay” even when it’s obviously not okay, or “it’s not your fault” because it’s not your fault, and there’s no reason for you to be apologizing. Adversely, saying “I’m sad that happened to you” gives the other person the opportunity to say “So am I. And you know what else? ...” \n\nI know that “I’m sorry” doesn’t always shut the door on further conversation, but it certainly doesn’t open any doors either. And hearing “I’m sorry” for the hundredth time when you’ve just gone through a tragedy gets really, really old. \n\nLanguage is *extremely* important. The words we use portray a lot more than what’s on the surface. I know it might seem like a tiny change, but being able to express sympathy rather than pity is a skill. Making this transition might help you to better emotionally support to your loved ones, and deepen your relationships overall. \n\nThanks for reading! :)\n\nEdit: This is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it is not intended to criticize the way you support people. Feel free to continue to say “I’m sorry” all you like, this is just a suggestion. \n\nAlso, if “I’m sad for you” (or whatever) feels too stiff, there’s plenty of ways to change it up with the same sentiment: “That breaks my heart,” “I’m so sad this happened,” “I’m heartbroken about this,” “I’m devastated to hear that,” etc. Point being that you’re in the moment with the other person, rather than looking down from a high horse of Pity.",
