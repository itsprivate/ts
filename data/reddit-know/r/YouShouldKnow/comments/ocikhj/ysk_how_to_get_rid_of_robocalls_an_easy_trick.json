I think this works because it tricks the robocaller software into believing that your phone number is a non-working number.  </p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way, if you answer it normally (by saying hello or something) or if you just let it goes to voicemail, the call still gets &quot;answered&quot;.  If you answer the call and say nothing, it makes your phone look like it is a <strong>non-working number</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been doing this consistently for the last few years and I probably only receive 1 or 2 robocalls per month.  I handle them this same way and they stop calling.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, there&#39;s no real downside to it... worst case you end up answering the phone for a real human you don&#39;t want to speak with.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: of course if my hypothesis is correct and this really does work... then sharing it with reddit will cause this technique to spread like wildfire and the robocallers will have to adapt their systems to overcome this technique, thereby damning me to get more robocalls.  You&#39;re welcome, reddit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
