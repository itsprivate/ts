They will be forced to give you a proper amount, in order to replace the vehicle you were paying them to insure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation 2.)&lt;/strong&gt; Get an &lt;strong&gt;independent estimate&lt;/strong&gt; from a reputable body shop, and if you believe your vehicle is beyond repair and ask the body shop if it were their car, would they repair it? If the answer is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, then fight your insurance company because you&amp;#39;re about to get a raw deal..and possibly end up with a vehicle that&amp;#39;s now dangerous and also possibly worthless to any lender or any future buyer (or any future insurance payout..)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
