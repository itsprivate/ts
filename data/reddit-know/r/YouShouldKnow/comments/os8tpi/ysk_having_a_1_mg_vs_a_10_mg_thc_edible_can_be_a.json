So I guess this is my RTFM for cannabis.</p>\n\n<p>For people who have never had cannabis (or who haven’t had it in recent months), you might want to try taking only 1 MG of THC. For example:</p>\n\n<p>1 MG: Some people will feel mild euphoria, some will feel nothing</p>\n\n<p>2 - 3 MG: Some people will feel euphoria and psychedelic effects, some will feel very little</p>\n\n<p>3 - 5 MG: Many people will feel euphoria and psychedelic effects, some people might feel overwhelmed or anxious</p>\n\n<p>5 - 10 MG: Most people will feel strong euphoria and psychedelic effects, many people will feel overwhelmed or anxious</p>\n\n<p>Start low and go slow.</p>\n\n<p>It’s better to take too little than to take too much. If you take too much you can experience mild to severe anxiety, panic attacks, and other unpleasant feelings. In some cases, people have a very bad experience that can cause lasting trauma.</p>\n\n<p>Know your dose.</p>\n\n<p>Taking 1 MG of THC on a Friday night, with a buddy to keep you company, is a great idea for your first time consuming cannabis. If you don’t experience any effects, take 2 MG the next time. Then 3 MG the next time. Give your body a full 24 hours to process the experience before trying again.</p>\n\n<p>Then, after you’ve gotten to understand how to reach a place of mild euphoria, excitement, or relaxation (depending on the product you take), you can try more if you want a stronger effect—or not!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s fine if you want to blast off to the moon and take more, but I&#39;m mainly just writing this for people who might not know how big a difference 1 MG vs. 10 MG can be for a cannabis newbie.</p>\n\n<p>Safe travels.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabis-edibles-dosage-guide-chart\">Source</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
