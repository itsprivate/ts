Nearly 56% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx\">Hemianopia</a> and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.</p>\n\n<p>The common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>So, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones. Stay safe and take care!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
