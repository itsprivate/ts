You can also buy organic produce. If you&#39;re on a budget, you can simply avoid the foods with the most pesticide (such as strawberries and almonds) if you want to protect pollinators.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/04/youre-worrying-wrong-bees/\">https://www.wired.com/2015/04/youre-worrying-wrong-bees/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
