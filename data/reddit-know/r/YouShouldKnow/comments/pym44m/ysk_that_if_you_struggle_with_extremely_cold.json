I had to use a combination of mittens and chemical hand warmers for winter, because my hands still wouldn&#39;t stay warm in regular gloves. I thought this was just a miserable quirk that I couldn&#39;t change.</p>\n\n<p>When it came up at a doctor&#39;s appointment randomly, the doc said that this is classic Raynaud&#39;s Phenomenon (previously I thought that just meant purple hands, and mine were never as purple as the pictures), and that the issue with cold is absolutely treatable! </p>\n\n<p>I was put on an extremely low dose of a calcium channel blocker (hopefully <a href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331197-treatment\">this</a> is an okay citation) to open my blood vessels a bit, and the doc said that alternatives are available if that isn&#39;t enough. So far, though, I&#39;ve have huge improvements in numbness and have been able to go without gloves in fall weather, which I could not do before!</p>\n\n<p>So, the bottom line - if you struggle with something like this, YOU ARE NOT DOOMED TO BE MISERABLE. It&#39;s worth bringing up to a medical professional!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
