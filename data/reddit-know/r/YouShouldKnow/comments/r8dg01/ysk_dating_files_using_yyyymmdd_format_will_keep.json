For example, if I save a file today, I would name it “Example Text 20211203”. If I needed to save a new version in the same day, it would be “Example Text 20211203v2”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting the date at the end instead of the front allows your files to be sorted alphabetically&amp;gt;chronologically. Putting the date at the front will sort your files chronologically&amp;gt;alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
