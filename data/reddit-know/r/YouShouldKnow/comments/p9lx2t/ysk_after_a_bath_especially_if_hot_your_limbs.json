Same with the arms.\nThe reason is not because your skin somehow gets soaked in water and weights more, like I thought for a long time.\nThe reason is because the water&#39;s heats dilates your blood vessels, and more blood can circulate in your limbs. This helps alleviate sore muscles and such because the blood can heal them much quicker with increased access.\nBe aware that the increased blood flow will come mainly from your brain and heart, which in turn makes your weaker and slower, therefore much more prone to accidents.\nAlways make sure to assess the weight and hold to some firm surface when you&#39;re standing up.\nCheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
