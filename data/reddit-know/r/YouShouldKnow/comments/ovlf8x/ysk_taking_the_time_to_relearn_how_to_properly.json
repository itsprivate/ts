Sometimes not even surgery can the damage.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to list below some tips that I never properly learned while growing up. Now I have to deal with the consequences because somethings can&#39;t be fixed. I encourage you to look through the list because I had no idea until I started having issues:</p>\n\n<p>Dental care: There are proper ways to brush your teeth. Brushing your teeth too hard, too long or with a hard brush scrapes off enamel and makes your gums recede. You might not notice because it happens slowly overtime. But one day your roots will be exposed and your teeth will be permanently yellow (the dentin under your enamel is yellowish brown). This is expensive to fix with gum grafts and eventually dentures. Seriously. Get an electric tooth brush or a very soft/soft tooth brush. DO NOT buy a &#39;hard&#39; toothbrush.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/sensitive-teeth/brush-teeth-too-hard/\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Blowing your nose: There is also a proper way to blow your nose. You need to blow gently and NEVER completely compress one nostril. The mucus can&#39;t go out the closed nostril obviously, so all you&#39;re doing is forcing it through your Eustachian tube and your middle ear. This causes ear infections which slowly degrade your hearing overtime. The middle ear is behind your ear drum and can&#39;t be drained through your ear canal (unless your ear drum bursts). Also depending on the pathogen this can potentially be life threatening being near your eyes and brain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/3-risks-of-blowing-your-nose-too-hard\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Picking/cleaning your nose: Don&#39;t be too rough &#39;picking your nose&#39; either with your fingers or kleenex. The skin in your nostrils is thin and can be permenently damaged causing frequent nose bleeds. I pretty much think about a kleenex and my nose starts bleeding. To my knowledge the only way to fix this issue is to have the area cauterized because I&#39;ve worn the tissue down too far to heal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medhealthdaily.com/nasal-cauterization/\">Sauce</a></p>\n\n<p>Posture and muscle instabilities: If you workout or are in a physically taxing job you can build imbalances in your muscles. In my case I worked my chest and biceps more than my back and had daily back pain for 4-5 years before I realized what was going on. I had &#39;Upper Cross Syndrome&#39; where my chest was way tighter than my back muscles. The picture on this source has a better explanation but once I started working my back more all of my back pain went away.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.builtlean.com/upper-lower-cross-syndrome/\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Seriously: wear sunscreen especially if you&#39;re exposed to the sun for more than an hour a day... Yes, even if its overcast outside. Its annoying but so is dying from cancer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/sunscreen-how-help-protect-your-skin-sun\">Do I really need a source for this?</a></p>\n\n<p>Honorable mention: Most people don&#39;t need to shampoo your hair daily. It only wastes money and dries your hair out. If you switch from daily shampooing to once every other day it takes a bit for your scalp to adjust and lower oil production but it is worth it in the long run. Also <a href=\"/u/ligerdrag20\">u/ligerdrag20</a> pointed out that some people shouldn&#39;t brush their hair while wet but it depends on your hair type! If you&#39;re concerned do a bit of research for your hair. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/how-often-wash-hair#1\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Alright that is all I can think of right now. If anyone wants to add or dispute any of these points please let me know and I&#39;ll correct it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
