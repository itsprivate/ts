Well you are in luck because I have never had to actually go inside the gas station because when that message appears simply hit the cancel button on the keypad and wait. Then reinsert your card and do not run your card as debit even though it is a debit card. There should be an instruction on how to run as credit and this is what you want to do. You may have to enter a zip code, you may not. Either way you now can pump your gas in peace without having to go inside. None of my friends or family knew this was possible and have been going inside to pay for their gas for as long as they can remember so I hope this helps someone!\n\nEdit: Someone said this is probably just a US/ North American issue!
