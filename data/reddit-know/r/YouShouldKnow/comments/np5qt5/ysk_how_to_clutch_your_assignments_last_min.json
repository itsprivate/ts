I don't care if you have it due in 5 mins. if you panic you won't start working until much later. also, most emotions can lead to panic, so try and suppress them. this isn't about finishing your homework in a healthy way, but about not handing it in late.\n2. decide the compromise right now. if it's a test, the content you studied the most before is gonna have to go. if it's a project, skip on the least marked criteria. have an action plan that gets you somewhere on the deadline then fix the compromises. fixing something, even if it's trash is a lot easier than working on a blank slate because it gives you the illusion that you're almost there. but understand you can also make a compromise in time. if you put this in mind, however, it leads to more procrastination. you make the compromise at the end. maybe skip the class before it's due. pull an allnighter. make an excuse for why it's late, its gonna get scummy and degrading but gain, this about clutching the grade.\n3. don't compromise sleep. you lose sleep and you lose your sanity. don't get me wrong, all-nighters are okay in the case of a single project which you can rest afterward, but an all-nighter takes time to regenerate from, ruining your sleep schedule. this doesn't work in the areas of stress where you need to procrastinate such as finals. you will trick yourself into thinking it's an easy compromise, it's not. in long periods of time, it will destroy your sanity, you will panic, and everything will fall apart. unless you have the next 2 days to regenerate, make sure you get 5 hours minimum every day.\n\nlast but not least and most importantly, use consumables wisely. I'm referring to coffee, that music that gets you hyped, alarms, maybe a drink or food that you associate with a clutch night. they are very powerful. the first time you drink coffee, its effect is insane. when I first listened to a hype song, I felt like on my way to Valhalla finishing the homework. they're incredibly useful and are your secret weapons. if you over procrastinate and use them all the time, they start to feel normal. associate them with clutch situations and only use them then.\n\nnow go finish the assignment NOW you've wasted too much time reading",
