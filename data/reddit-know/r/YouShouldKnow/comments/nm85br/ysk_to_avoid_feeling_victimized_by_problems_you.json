If you manage to see yourself as the hero of an epic story (even a little bit), you won’t feel victimised by the setbacks along the way, because your willingness to confront obstacles is precisely what defines you as a hero in the first place. \n\nObviously I’m not saying you should engage in wishful thinking.
