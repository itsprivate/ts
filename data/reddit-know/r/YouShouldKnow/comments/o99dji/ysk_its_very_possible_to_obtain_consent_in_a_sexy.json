The consent should be enthusiastic and clear. </p>\n\n<p>Alot of people seem to think that asking for consent can dampen the mood or make the encounter seem transactional. Instead they take the &quot;go with the flow&quot; and &quot;just read body language* route. I&#39;m not judging anybody that has good intentions, it&#39;s legitimate to think that flat out asking&quot; do you want to have sex now&quot; can be weird or off putting, but it really doesn&#39;t have to be. Asking for consent can be just as sexy and natural as any other sexy talk. Here&#39;s a few examples of me personally obtaining consent:</p>\n\n<p>(during a hot &amp; heavy make out session) <em>I want make love to you</em>........ <em>would you like that</em></p>\n\n<p>her response : a lustful look and a yea</p>\n\n<p>(sitting in the car having a great conversation) I touch her hand and playfully ask <em>can I kiss you</em> </p>\n\n<p>her response: she smiles and says go ahead</p>\n\n<p>(after a bit of intercourse) I look at her and say <em>I want to taste you</em></p>\n\n<p>her response: an enthusiastic head nod and &quot;please do&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I know it sounds kinda cheesy just reading the words on a screen but I promise if you let the words come out in a way that fits the mood not only will it sound natural but it can actually be incredibly sexy, try it next time!</p>\n\n<p>Last thing, this advice is genderless</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
