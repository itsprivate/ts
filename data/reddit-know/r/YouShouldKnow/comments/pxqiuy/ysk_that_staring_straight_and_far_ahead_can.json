But a super helpful tip I learned to combat it is looking straight ahead, this helps balance the fluids in your ear that otherwise would cause car sickness. It also helps to stare at something far ahead. Since it is far it seems to move less and is less visually nauseating. However car sickness medication can do wonders as-well.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: sometimes you get carsick when you normally don’t and need to not throw up. Or you get carsick often and need help. Or you forgot the medicine you normally take. </p>\n\n<p>Also would love to hear more tips in the comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
