This is because commercial buildings are constructed with most of the HVAC in the common areas, so the smaller spaces and individual offices have minimal ductwork. This means almost all of the fresh air is circulating in the main areas, rather than in smaller spaces like offices, which often have meetings (or are shared), with everyone breathing the same air over and over.</p>\n\n<p>Note when I say circulation, that’s only part of it. <strong>The air <em>exchange</em> rate is very important.</strong> This is why relatively few respiratory illnesses get traced back to airplanes… You sit elbow to elbow, jam-packed like sardines, for hours, and almost no one gets sick. This is because the entire volume of air on a flight is completely changed every few minutes. That’s air circulation and exchange. Look at this way: If I put a grain of salt in a bowl of soup you won’t know it. If I add 5 more grains in you probably won’t know it. But If I put 50 grains in you’re almost sure to taste it. The same principle applies to particles in the air. Breathe too many from someone in the transmissible stage and you may be soon share it. This is why it matters if the air is still versus if there’s a slight breeze, because the odds of you catching something become much slimmer. This is like how you might gag on cigarette smoke coming from a restaurant table next to you, versus barely noticing someone smoking outside at the same distance.</p>\n\n<p>As for public restrooms, here is where millions of people have been unknowingly infected. Like offices, most are constructed with little duct work, so the air is not exchanging/transferring. But now it’s even worse because every time someone flushes it launches millions of microscopic particles into the room.</p>\n\n<p>So act accordingly... Office meetings should be held with a door open and a fan blowing in or out of the doorway. Public restrooms? Ceiling vent fans should run non-stop during the work day and they should have a high capacity blower, too. Occupancy should be limited and break times should be staggered. And leave the doors open when not in use.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve included a link about ventilation importance, too. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmzEQtGRXQ&amp;t=64s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmzEQtGRXQ&amp;t=64s</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
