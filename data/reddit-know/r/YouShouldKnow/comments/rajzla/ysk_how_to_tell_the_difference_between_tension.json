  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: There is a HUGE difference between migraines and tension headaches. Tension headaches are the most common type of headache though most people unknowingly refer to them and treat them as migraines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Migraines are a neurological problem and tension headaches are more of a muscular problem. Of course it is much more complicated than this but I’m trying to keep it as basic as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve suffered from tension headaches for the past 7 years that have been so bad they cost me friendships, relationships, and multiple jobs. Because of this I am very educated on tension headaches (but not so much migraines).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can tell if you have tension headaches (and not migraines):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time you have a headache take a muscle relaxer than contains ibuprofen (this is usually the purple coloured bottle). Robax platinum or any store brand version will work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find relief from the muscle relaxer, you likely have tension headaches, not migraines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many other ways to test it such as using ice and heat as those tend to do good for tension headaches but they can also help some people with migraines, so it’s not a definite answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the muscle relaxer does not relieve your pain you either have migraines or another type of headaches such as cluster headaches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are somethings to consider if you have tensions headaches as these are common factors in those that do. Consider fixing them as they can be the cause of your pain:\n- do you grind your teeth? \n- are you low on magnesium?\n- do you sleep on your side or stomach?\n- do you have poor posture? \n- do you have proper tongue posture/where does your tongue sit in your mouth (it’s should be firmly pressed against the roof of your mouth). &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; relaxed. I used  to grind my teeth at night and would try to relax my whole mouth during the day to stop it. In reality this was causing more damage as one of the most important parts of good posture is having your tongue pressing against the roof of your mouth as frequently as possible) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have so much more advice but I don’t want to make this post too long. I hope I can help at least one person with this info :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
