So these things suddenly going off is the equivalent of you on the toilet and someone shoots a shotgun off next to your ear without you having a clue it's coming.\n\nIf you see a post-it note on a hand dryer saying an autistic child is in there at the moment, PLEASE give us 1 minute to get out of there. It costs you 1 minute (or 0 if you like wet hands) but could set him back months of progress and limit what our family is able to get out and do. We literally have to restart at square 1 of just practicing walking by the doors and having him flip out seeing the signs. Then to walking in and straight out and so on. I will take the post-it off before we leave.\n\nAs for the post-it on the automatic toilet sensor...I may or may not be able to take that one. If you go into a stall and see one of these feel free to help a fellow human out by removing it. It'll probably have a short note on it explaining with an apology. If I'm alone, I can't take it off with him there and he can't be left alone outside while I try.",
