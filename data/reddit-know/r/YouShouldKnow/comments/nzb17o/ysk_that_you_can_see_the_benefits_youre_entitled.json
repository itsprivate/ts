It provides you with a ton of valuable information.\n\nOnce you create an account on the [SSA's Online Service Portal](https://www.ssa.gov/onlineservices/), you can see:\n\n1) What they have on record for your yearly earnings for the duration of your working life (so you can confirm it's accurate... and it's cool to see).\n\n2) What you'll collect once you turn 67 and are eligible for SSI.\n\n2) What you'd collect should you become eligible for SSD.\n\n4) What your dependents and/or spouse would receive should they become eligible for Survivor's Benefits because you passed away.\n\n5) If you've worked enough to even be eligible for any of those benefits. \n\n6) The estimated taxes you and your employer(s) will pay towards Social Security and Medicare in your lifetime.\n\n... Among other things.\n\nUnrelated to the benefits this website provides, but it also allowed me to show my parents how stagnant wages have been by [comparing their yearly earnings from when they were my age with mine](https://i.imgur.com/Lv75whI.jpg). We're in similar paying professions so it's a pretty accurate depiction. It was awesome watching their faces as they came to the realization that I'm not completely full of shit, lol. :)\n\nWhy YSK: You can check their records for accuracy before it comes time for you to actually need to utilize any of the benefits that are available to you. It can also help you prepare for retirement by having a good idea of how much you'll be paid. And also, it's super interesting (at least I think so).\n\nFair warning... You have to be able to prove your identity and if you mess up enough, they'll make you register via snail mail. Make sure you're answering exactly as they want (i.e, don't put your address as 123 Drive Drive if your tax return shows 123 Drive Dr).",
