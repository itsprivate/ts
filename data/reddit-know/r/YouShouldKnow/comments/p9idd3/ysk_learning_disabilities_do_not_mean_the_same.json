Below is a table where I explain the criteria for the four different levels of learning disabilities someone can have.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Type of Learning/Intellectual disabiltity</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Diagnostic criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Mild Intellectual disability</td>\n<td align=\"left\">IQ 50 to 70; Slower than typical in all developmental areas; No unusual physical characteristics; Able to learn practical life skills; Attains reading and math skills up to grade levels 3 to 6; Able to blend in socially; Functions in daily life</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Moderate Intellectual disability</td>\n<td align=\"left\">IQ 35 to 49; Noticeable developmental delays (i.e. speech, motor skills); May have physical signs of impairment (i.e. thick tongue); Can communicate in basic, simple ways; Able to learn basic health and safety skills; Can complete self-care activities; Can travel alone to nearby, familiar places</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Severe Intellectual disability</td>\n<td align=\"left\">IQ 20 to 34; Considerable delays in development; Understands speech, but little ability to communicate; Able to learn daily routines; May learn very simple self-care; Needs direct supervision in social situations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Profound Intellectual disability</td>\n<td align=\"left\">IQ less than 20; Significant developmental delays in all areas; Obvious physical and congenital abnormalities; Requires close supervision; Requires attendant to help in self-care activities; May respond to physical and social activities; Not capable of independent living</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Learning difficulties</p>\n\n<p>A learning difficulty is a condition that can cause an individual to experience problems in a traditional classroom learning context. It may interfere with literacy skills development and math/maths and can also affect memory, ability to focus and organizational skills. No two individuals with a learning difficulty are exactly alike and many conditions, such as dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia, exist on a wide-spectrum. To be diagnosed, you must have specific issues that do not correlate with what would be expected of your overall IQ. See my table below to learn about the most common learning difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Types of learning difficulties</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Definitions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Dyslexia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Individuals who struggle with dyslexia can have issues with reading, writing or spelling or any combination of them.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Dyscalculia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Individuals who struggle with dyscalculia have difficulty with processing numbers, whether that be basic arithmetic, deciding the approach to take on a mathematical problem, sequencing numbers and understanding spatial reasoning.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Dysgraphia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Individuals who struggle with dysgraphia have a hard time with writing and may produce text that is illegible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ADHD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">There are three types of ADHD (ADHD-Primarily Inattentive; ADHD-Primarily Hyperactive/Impulsive; and ADHD-Combined Presentation).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Dyspraxia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">A motor-skills difficulty that can affect a learner’s ability to write by hand, and may impact on planning skills</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know how useful this could be for anyone, but as someone with dyscalculia, Asperger&#39;s (Autism) and ADHD-Combined Presentation, I get really frustrated when people call my difficulties by the wrong name!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
