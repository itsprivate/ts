It&#39;s my hope that people who suffer from chronic insomnia or issues falling asleep might be able to use this technique to sleep more consistently. I also think it may prove a useful tool for people who suffer constantly from issues like anxiety, stress, and panic.</p>\n\n<p>To perform the technique, first expel all air from your lungs, then do a deep inhale that lasts 4 seconds. With your lungs full of air, hold your breath for 7 seconds. Finally, exhale through your mouth (through your lips, making a whooshing sound) for 8 seconds. The ratio between the time of each step is more important than counting seconds accurately, so if you have trouble holding your breath, timing like 2, 3.5, and 4 might work too, although 4-7-8 is the most common recommendation and seems to elicit the most success. If you repeat the steps 2 or 3 times, your body should enter &quot;rest and digest&quot; mode, which may help you fall asleep quickly if you&#39;re already in good sleeping conditions (comfortable, laying down, dark and quiet) or promote relaxation if you&#39;re stressed or anxious.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
