It appears that when banks have multiple clients sending payments to the same company, they will hold the checks and send them all in the same envelope. I regularly receive packets of bill payment checks, with the checks themselves having dates ranging over a space of two weeks. The number of clients who get angry with me for telling him I haven&amp;#39;t received their payment yet, when the bank has given them a date and already withdrawn their funds makes me realize that people don&amp;#39;t understand how bill payment seems to work. The funds don&amp;#39;t come out of your account when the checks are received, they come out of your account when the checks are printed, which is not necessarily even when they are mailed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that this may not apply to all bank bill pay systems and you should contact your individual bank for more details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
