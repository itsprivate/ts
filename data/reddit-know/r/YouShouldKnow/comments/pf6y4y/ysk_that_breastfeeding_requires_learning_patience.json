There is so much encouragement to initiate breastfeeding, but often very little support to actually continue to do so. There seems to be a common misconception that breastfeeding just <em>works</em>, instinctively, and if you are finding it tough or struggling, that something is <em>wrong</em>, and there is a reason to stop. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Breastfeeding is not natural like breathing, it is natural  like walking or talking</strong> </p>\n\n<p>It requires learning (some things can be learned before, some must be learned by actually <em>doing</em>) - Some key things to look up are - cluster feeding, normal infant sleep in breastfed babies, signs of effective feeding, how to achieve a deep latch...</p>\n\n<p>It requires patience - sometimes babies are born tired from birth, sometimes they are a little sleepy from pain meds during labour, sometimes they just take a little longer to grasp it... don&#39;t be disheartened and abandon breastfeeding if it doesn&#39;t &#39;work&#39; right away. Keep trying, keep bringing baby to the breast, have <strong>faith</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>It requires practice - just because baby latches well during one feed, isn&#39;t a guarantee that they will do so at the next feed. Just because baby latches well in one position, doesn&#39;t mean another will be so straightforward. Don&#39;t let this put you off, you and baby are learning together. The only way to encourage baby to &#39;learn&#39; is to <em>keep trying</em>, and the only way you will become confident with different positions is to <em>keep trying</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you have chosen to breastfeed, please try to stay positive. Your body is designed to do this, your baby and you are capable of achieving your breastfeeding goals. The only way to guarantee that breastfeeding doesn&#39;t work out, is to stop/not try. </p>\n\n<p>It may not happen right away, and that is <em>FINE</em>. Ask for support, contact a professional, keep practicing and most of all - <strong>BELIEVE IN YOURSELF</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit to add - Sometimes breastfeeding doesn&#39;t work out. There are a multitude of reasons for this, most of which can only be diagnosed by a healthcare professional/lactation expert. If you are struggling and want to continue to breastfeed - contact an IBCLC. If you are struggling and would like to stop breastfeeding, you do <em>you</em>, you know what is best for you and your baby, and formula is a brilliant alternative to breastmilk.❤</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/about/breastfeeding-in-the-uk/\">https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/about/breastfeeding-in-the-uk/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
