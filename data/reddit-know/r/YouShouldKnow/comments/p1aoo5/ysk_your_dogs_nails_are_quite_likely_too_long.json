The longer this goes on, the constant pressure will cause their toes to splay. Your dog may overcompensate by standing awkwardly - anything to relieve the pressure. This bad posture isn&#39;t good for their knees, hips, and spine. Think about how it feels when you wear uncomfortable shoes when you&#39;re standing, running, etc...except your dog can&#39;t take them off. If your dog has hip/joint issues, is older, disabled, or poorly bred, it&#39;s going to seriously exacerbate those problems. Additionally, your dog can slip and fall on slick surfaces, or just &quot;Bambi on ice&quot; all over your tile floors. With some breeds, the nails grow at such an extreme curve that they can become embedded in their pads and become infected. Yikes!</p>\n\n<p>A note: As their nail grows, the &quot;quick&quot; (tip of the toe inside the nail, sometimes called a vein) will grow with it, making it impossible to trim them back far enough unless you get them cut and cauterized at a vet. Cutting them frequently will help the quick recede, over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to help</strong>: Get your dog&#39;s nails trimmed more frequently, by yourself or a professional. Vets, groomers, and local shops can help. If you&#39;re doing it yourself, YouTube it, don&#39;t go in blind. Use proper trimmers or grinders. Don&#39;t push a dog past its limits if it&#39;s freaking out - you&#39;ll make the job much harder for the next person if they&#39;re traumatized. Walk your dog more on hard surfaces, like pavement, packed beach sand, stone, you get it. Make a schedule and stick to it!</p>\n\n<p>Save your dog the pain and help them out. Nails are often overlooked and the effects can&#39;t always be seen until years down the line. You can&#39;t turn back the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, yes, some dogs don&#39;t need regular trims. If you have an active dog who runs the nails down on their own, this tip is not for you. However, keep an eye out as your pup ages or with prolonged bad weather that keeps them from exercising.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
