Sometimes these ads fall under the category of “clickbait,” but often times they’re so well disguised the average web user may not know the content wasn’t written from an unbiased point of view. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you go on yahoo.com and look at Yahoo! Auto, you’ll see a list of articles with tiny text underneath that says, “sponsored by Kelley Blue Book,” or something similar. These articles will be called things like “Taking a look at 2021 SUVs,” “The best crossover SUVs of 2021,” and, “how to choose your next family car.” </p>\n\n<p>I used to work for a Native Ad agency as a designer. It was my job to take the articles written by some random folks who know absolutely nothing about the automotive industry and pair them with images that we were given by our clients. The writers would be given 8-15 keywords to use in each article, a few key phrases, and some points to hit. I’d get a folder of images to edit, manipulate, crop and filter to have the best chance of being both eye-catching and appealing. </p>\n\n<p>After being laid off, then subsequently being contacted to do some contracting work for some of the company’s clients directly, I decided not to participate in this specific kind of advertising work, because of the manipulative practices. Incredibly predatory payday loan companies, advertisers who just advertise so they can sell your data (which include the payday loan companies… I could write a whole post about the ad schemes behind these kinds of companies), and drop-shipping vendors frequently use this kind of advertising tactic.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to avoid this kind of advertising is to be on the constant look out for phrases like “sponsored by,” “published with permission from,” “paid for by,” and “this article includes paid promotions.” These labels will appear either at the very top or very bottom of an article, but they’re not always there as there is no enforced law or rule that says you have to identify promotional content online. </p>\n\n<p>Another way to be wary of these schemes is to look out for the companies that host these kinds of ads. Outbrain and Taboola are the big two, you have probably seen their logos before, even if you don’t recognize their names. </p>\n\n<p>Be wary, stay vigilant, know that every bit of internet interaction you do is being catalogued so that we can track you, predict your habits, and influence you to buy things. If you use a device that belongs to you (tablet, phone, desktop, etc) and/or on an IP address that provides internet for you and your household, there is a metric being measured. What time you wake up, the places you navigate to with your phone, every question you google. Every person has a profile that advertisers can use to create audiences for their ads based on hundreds of metrics, from your age to the type of toothpaste you use.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
