In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. &amp;#39;Here&amp;#39;s the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about&amp;#39;, I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. &amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s it?&amp;#39; I thought to myself &amp;#39;I bust my chops all day for $15?&amp;#39; I was livid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, she said &amp;quot;That was nice of her, spending her own money like that.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s when I realized that this wasn&amp;#39;t a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn&amp;#39;t realize that we were the only team to get something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My manager - who wasn&amp;#39;t getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
