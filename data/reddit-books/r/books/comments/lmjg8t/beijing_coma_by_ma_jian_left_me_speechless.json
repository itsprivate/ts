You build emotional connections to his friends and family but I felt a certain helplessness. Even when the story cuts back to the present, it is accompanied with a sour pang while narrating the lives of his friends, as they continue to move on while Dai Wei remains trapped within his body. The boundaries of life and death, present and past get increasingly blurred as it leads up to that fateful night, and the emotional journey intensifies with it.\n\nI'm sorry, I'd like to elaborate more but I'm at such a loss of words now as you can probably tell.",
