I finally gave a few of her books a shot and they&#39;re among the best I&#39;ve read all year.</p>\n\n<p>She deals in smaller-scale stuff--no grand space operas, no worlds at stake. It&#39;s about small groups of people in a big galaxy, dealing with cultures and societal structures way bigger than they are. The world doesn&#39;t budge for them the way it does in so many other SF/F books. The overarching themes revolve around social justice, and play out through character study. You get to know people and their problems, and how they relate to each other. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t stand being preached at (blame a childhood spent in churches), so the way Chambers goes about her themes is refreshing. She doesn&#39;t beat you over the head with moral-of-the-story dialogue and treats her readers with respect rather than talking down to them as soooooo many authors do when discussing equality. She acknowledges that the privileged have a right to an opinion on how to handle societal problems, rather than insisting that they merely listen and obey. </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s more, she follows the sci-fi tradition of handling big theoretical ideas in application-based terms. She makes you really think about what it means to live in a multicultural society, and how to handle when those cultures irreconcilably disagree. She poses questions that don&#39;t actually have good answers, and explores the limits of what a toleration-based society is capable of. She makes you wonder about your place in your own society--wherever that may be. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Read the book! It&#39;s short.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
