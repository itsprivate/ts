Evelyn was a very layered character. Her ambition was ruthless in the beginning, yes, but she really grew as a person. As she got older she grew wiser and more nuanced. Which I think is attributed to the fact that this book was written by a woman. I’m not certain a male author would’ve had the discipline to give Evelyn that level of warmth and compassion without falling into the above trope that usually befalls anti-heroes(especially white male ones).</p>\n\n<p>She was a woman of several contradictions. In a small way, she reminds me of Joe Gideon from All That Jazz, someone so convinced they’re going to hell for the way they’ve treated people, that they fail to realize that when you peel back the layers, they’re a decent person.</p>\n\n<p>Convinced she had a heart of ice, time and time Evelyn proved the contrary, she had a heart of gold and the Hollywood machine never claimed her humanity. </p>\n\n<p>She really did love her significant other, and truly would give up everything for them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I suck at articulating my thoughts. Give the book a read. You’re definitely in for an adventure. Phenomenal highs and tearful lows. A nice little subversion of tropes, and a powerful, if even a little tragic, love story.</p>\n\n<p>Also Brittany Snow was born to play Celia St. James for the adaption.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
