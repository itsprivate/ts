If you haven't read it, it is about a psycho killer being hunted by the b.s.u guys. But the villain has been given a great back story and you will love him. When Harris writes about forensics, he spares no details and when he writes about the humans he hits right in the guts. All his characters are relatable, human, heroes, cowards and bastards. I loved how he leaves so many things unspoken and that gives so much credit to the reader. Again his humor is subtle and he made me laugh out loud in some of the darkest places in the book. If you have seen the movie, no matter, the book is still worth reading.",
