I’m really enjoying it overall, but that’s mainly because I like the mystery that he’s building. His actual writing is leaving a lot to be desired for me.</p>\n\n<p>• The main character of the book is a writer, and there’s an almost masturbatory quality to the way King writes this character and others’ reactions to him. Immediately upon arriving in Jerusalem’s Lot, he strikes up a relationship with a young attractive woman who’s a big fan of his work. Her father immediately likes him because of the way he’s dressed and how down-to-earth he is. The local teacher thinks he’s a genius. He seems like a pretty obvious self-insert on King’s part, but maybe others think otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>• King tends to over-describe things. Like when he writes, “So-and-so extended a hand, and Ben shook it,” instead of just writing, “They shook hands.” At another part, he describes a character swirling pasta step-by-step, a detail which adds nothing. The most egregious one is an extremely overwrought description of Fall, which King compares to an old friend sitting in a couch and lighting a pipe and telling stories. Maybe King’s friends are all Dickens characters, but I found this description odd for a number of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>• A lot of the dialogue feels either forced or bland, but the characters don’t seem to recognize this. Sometimes a character will say something that’s neither funny or interesting and another character will react by busting out laughing as if a hilarious joke has just been told.</p>\n\n<p>• He calls boobs “jahoobies.”</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, I’m enjoying the book because of the mystery that King is weaving, but the moment-to-moment writing is leaving a lot to be desired. Is this a common criticism of King’s writing? Did his writing improve over time?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
