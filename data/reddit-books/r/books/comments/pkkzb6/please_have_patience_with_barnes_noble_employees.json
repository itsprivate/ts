Other than the usual frustrations of being booksellers in the year 2021 we have also been the subject of constant abuse from customers. All we’re asking is please be patient with us. Here are somethings t be aware of and please spread the word:\n1) if we could have every book ever made in stores we would. We’re not Amazon, we can’t have dozens of every small press title ready to go and in your hand in two days. \n2) Shipping delays have affected us too. We want your order to come ASAP but we don’t control the shipping lines or the warehouses and we’re not given any real means of tracking your order either. \n3) we’re short short staffed. Like everywhere else. We’re paid minimum wage and people are going anywhere else quoting after two weeks and they can’t even hold onto managers. We’re doing our best but a lot of us are new and still getting used to the job and we don’t have a lot of backup for when we get busy. Please have patience with us.</p>\n\n<p>So many of us have been reduced to absolute tears the past few weeks from customers yelling at us. Throwing books around and just the stress of each person trying to the job of three or more. We love books and love bringing those joys to people but we definitely need help and support during these trying times.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
