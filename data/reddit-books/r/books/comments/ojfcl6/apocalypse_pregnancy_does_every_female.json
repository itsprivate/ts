  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m a big fan of apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction and after reading too many of these books during the pandemic, it&#39;s abundantly clear this trope is completely played out. I get it, it&#39;s human drama on a primal level. It&#39;s one of the ultimate fears in a world without modern medicine. It&#39;s not a death sentence like many other medical conditions, no one is getting a new heart valve installed or liver transplant. But it feels like I&#39;ve seen every conceivable variation on this theme and I hope authors will note how over saturated this is in the genre. It&#39;s bad enough that as soon as a female protagonist is having sex, you know the story is going to revolve around her pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>And honestly, it smacks of a little casual sexism. It reduces otherwise complex characters down to this narrow view and reason to survive. It gives every generic leading man a righteous cause to fight for. I get why it&#39;s used, but it&#39;s time to let a female protagonist have a different obstacle.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? I fully recognize it&#39;s part of the human experience so it&#39;s inherently going to be a part of fiction. And as a father it does have intended gut punch for me imagining trying to care for my own daughter in these circumstances. It&#39;s effective and breaks my heart every time I read such a story, I just wish it was so pervasive that the moment a woman, particularly if she&#39;s a protagonist, hooks up with someone I know where the story is going.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I think a lot of people are getting hung up thinking I don&#39;t think the story should involve pregnancy. It absolutely is going to be part of the world building and having a decent sized community with no pregnant women would be weird. My point is that it&#39;s a bit played out having the same scene of the protagonist having sex, immediately getting pregnant from that first coupling, and start vomiting out of nowhere one chapter later letting the audience know she&#39;s pregnant. I&#39;d feel the same way if every post apocalyptic book with a male protagonist had a man suffer from testicular torsion. And if every time in a book a man has stomach pain you go, yep here we go again, it&#39;s another testicular torsion tale. Can&#39;t they make him have any other obstacles to cause character growth?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
