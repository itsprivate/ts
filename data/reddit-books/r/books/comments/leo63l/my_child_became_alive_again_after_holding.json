I suspect many other children are the same way...extremely tactile and visual.  At this time, our library is only providing pick up service.  It has been at least 5 months since I've been able to check out books for my children at the library.  Yesterday, because I got off earlier than usual, I was able to place some books on hold and pick them up at the end of my work shift.  \n\nAfter we had finished dinner, I reminded my son that I had brought home some library books.  He went to the library book box, chose 2 books and began reading.  He was so engaged and delighted to be able to hold a book in his hand and turn pages with his delicate fingers.  I listened to him read and laugh and get excited at the plot points.  It was refreshing.  When he finished his second book,  he jumped up and exclaimed, \"I feel alive....like my brain is becoming more intelligent because I'm reading books!\"  I was so happy for him.  He was so engaged that he continued reading the other books well into the night.  He finally went to sleep around 11:30.  He was so happy that he had a smile on his face while he was sleeping.\n\n\nI appreciate that that we did have the option of reading books online.  My other son probably prefers that method the most.  But for some kids, like my youngest child, there's nothing better than to hold a book in one's hands.  He has always been that way.  \n\n\nMy local branch is located in an area if lower income, disadvantaged residents.  I wish they would take more consideration of that and extend library hours for this purpose as it is difficult to pick up books when a parent gets off around closing time (5 or 6). In addition, I wish the library could make known what new books (for children)  are available.  I am thankful to be given the option to pick up books.  I will do my best to make time to check out books for my children.",
