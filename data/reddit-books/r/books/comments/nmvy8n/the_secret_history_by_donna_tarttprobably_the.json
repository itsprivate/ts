The characters were so incredibly complex people (especially Bunny and Henry) who have their own principles and stick to them.\n\n3. The obsession with beauty and aesthetics in the book. The book is filled with lovely quotes and made me fall in love with Ancient Greece.\n\nAnother great thing about this book is its straightforward writing style. It makes it easier to follow the complicated ideologies and rituals mentioned. \n\nWould 100% recommend it.",
