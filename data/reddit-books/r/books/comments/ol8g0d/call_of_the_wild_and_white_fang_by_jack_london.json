Poor Buck and White Fang! Reading both of them being beat into submission, turned into viscous fighting dogs, starved and strained to beyond human limits, again and again, was difficult. </p>\n\n<p>Still, one cannot knock the vivid images that London captures, he really gave an excellent perspective to each dog, with both animals being totally separate characters. </p>\n\n<p>Like, Buck, from CotW, is a formerly domestic dog, that is kidnapped and turned into a sled dog; From there, he essentially becomes an überhund, dominating every dog he comes across in a hellish descent into madness, and ascent to supremacy.<br/>\nWhite Fang, meanwhile, is almost pure unadulterated wildness. A wolf, who is taken from the wild, and absolutely oppressed into slavish and resentful submission all his life; From the time he is a diminutive puppy, to when he is full grown. </p>\n\n<p>I loved all the description of ancestor memories in CotW. Buck thinking to himself, as he stares at his master across a campfire, how his distant wolf ancestors saw a similar creature, hairy and exposed, hunched over a fire, always looking over his back, and armed with a simple club. Whereas Buck and his kin evolved to an almost physical supremacy, humanity evolved in quite a different direction, and it seems not so long ago, that Buck may have considered this man-beast as prey.</p>\n\n<p>That was an interesting angle that I&#39;m glad CotW explored. But White Fang went in almost the total opposite direction of that; White Fang looks at humans as gods, from a primordial instinct. He is lesser, and thus, he must submit to humanity. It is this lack of Self-fulfillment from White Fang that drives most of his tragic life. At almost no point does he trust humanity, but he submits to them, almost purely out of instinct.  And that is really quite tragic.</p>\n\n<p>Good stories. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t expect these books to be as existential as they were, it was honestly quite surprising :)</p>\n\n<p>What did you think of these stories?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
