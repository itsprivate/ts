My family only ever buys books on holidays, so we get 90% of our books from the library. When I am done with a book thats been purchased, and I don’t think il read it again, Il usually donate it or drop it into the return slot at my library. Is that not a common thing? I feel like it’s kinda useless to keep a book if I won’t read it again, and I’d rather have it somewhere where someone else can also enjoy that book. Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
