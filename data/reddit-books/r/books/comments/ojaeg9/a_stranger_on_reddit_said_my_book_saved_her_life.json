More than a year ago I wrote a book with self-explanatory title &quot;Stories I Wrote While Being Suicidal&quot;... Everyone who read it liked the book very much, but since I am nobody, I don&#39;t have a bunch of friends, I don&#39;t have thousands of followers on social networks and money for advertising, therefore, no one in this world knows about the existence of my book - except those whom I met here on Reddit and personally sent my book.</p>\n\n<p>I have already resigned myself to the fact that the book will never become popular. And it was never about popularity and money.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it could help someone.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, my dreams have come true. No, my book hasn&#39;t become a bestseller. Much better - my book saved someone&#39;s life..:)</p>\n\n<p>Here is what a reader from Reddit wrote to me two days ago, to whom I sent my book back in April last year:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You sent me a copy of your book and I started to read the first pages but I got all caught up with work and postgrad studies and interrupted my readings. I started to read it again a few weeks later during a particularly gruesome depressive episode and your stories were among the few things that distracted my mind from the dark path I was going through (Oddly enough, considering that the content of your stories could make me gloomier than I already am. Go figure!😂). The same happened when I had a bad case of COVID 2 weeks ago, was sick as a dog and had to be away from work, from my family and from everything else. I think I can say that you, Edgar Allan Poe and Dean Koontz are the authors that always distract me and help me to go through hard times when my mind doesn&#39;t concentrate on anything else. I should have contacted you a long time ago. But I just want to thank you for your work and to thank you for sending me the e-book. You&#39;re very talented, your writing style is superb and I don&#39;t want to sound corny, but your work saved my literal life. I wish you all, all the best. Thank you! &quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
