It&#39;s quite sad when I think about it given how much I love reading and even have a library in my house. What makes it worse was the last book I read was rubbish, I didn&#39;t really enjoy it at all but read it as I don&#39;t like leaving books half started. It was &#39;How Not to Die Alone&#39; by Richard Roper. Had I have known I might have re-read an old favourite or tried a random new genre. I&#39;ve never tried audiobooks, and I know there is a debate as to if it constitutes reading, but for me it&#39;s going to have to be the way forwards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
