I guess it ticks some of those boxes (I wouldn’t call it fun), but not really in the cathartic way I assumed it would. I sort of want to hate this book, because it’s so disturbing, but I can’t help but be impressed by it. I’m not sure that I’ve ever wished more for terrible, predictable writing. There were plenty of moments that were intense enough, but the incredibly well-written characters amplified every unpleasant moment. There were several times that I decided it was too much and tried to put it down, but I just couldn’t stop reading until I saw the conclusion. I’m can’t remember the last time something has caused such a visceral reaction in me. I don’t think I’ll be reading the sequels, as I quite like the ambiguity that this book ends on. </p>\n\n<p>** Also, I’m still mad they didn’t kill anyone/burn the house down on their way out.</p>\n\n<p>edit: I should mention that I’m a fan of psychological horror, and that probably influences my opinion of this book, but it’s definitely not a light read and I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone that can’t distance themselves from characters</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
