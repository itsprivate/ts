  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>The Iron Dream</em> is about a hero who finds himself drawn into an epic struggle against an evil empire of mind-controlling mutants who seek to destroy the forces of good. After rooting out one of the mutants, he gets in a fight with a bunch of rogues and wins a powerful, mystical weapon of old that makes him King of his People, and from there, he leads the forces of good in a battle against the evil mind-controllers.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds similar to other sci-fi and fantasy stories, right?</p>\n\n<p>Except, what if I told you that the story I described was Adolf Hitler’s Hugo-award winning sci-fantasy, <em>Lord of the Swastika</em>? Because that’s the major premise of <em>The Iron Dream</em>. It pretends to be another book entirely, written by an alternate history Adolf Hitler who emigrated to the US in 1919 instead of becoming Leader of the Nazi Party.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps fittingly for a story that prefers arming its character with truncheons over swords, the book keeps bludgeoning us over the head with the same message: your sword and sorcery story is uncomfortably fascist. And if that isn’t enough, it ends with an academic reviewing the book, literally reminding us of the central narrative, by explicitly dissecting how the fictional Hitler is taking your bog standard tropes and turning them up to eleven, whilst swapping out usual fantasy terms of good and evil with eugenics terms. Subtlety is not this book&#39;s watchword, and some old copies even resorted to having a motorcycle-riding Hitler on the front cover. (Despite this, some readers didn’t get the message and it ended up on the American Nazi Party’s recommended reading list. Go figure.)</p>\n\n<p>Norman Spinrad wrote this book to criticise the militaristic power fantasies that seemed to crop up again and again in books of his time, such as Robert Heinlein and Orson Scott Card. Apparently, he took specific issue against Card&#39;s <em>Ender Game</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I personally haven’t read many stories that would fit that narrative. I didn’t think it was a huge problem anymore, thought most modern authors seemed to have also noticed this and taken it to heart. But perhaps that&#39;s because those stories don&#39;t appeal to me; there could be plenty and I&#39;m just not seeing them, because I&#39;m ignoring them. And then it occurred to me, what about other media? I know <em>Starship Troopers</em> (ironically based on a Heinlein book) doesn&#39;t count, because the people who made it were intentionally doing what Spinrad was doing. But some other TV shows, videogames and movies, kind of feature similar elements.</p>\n\n<p>Is Spinrad&#39;s book still sadly as relevant now as it was when written?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
