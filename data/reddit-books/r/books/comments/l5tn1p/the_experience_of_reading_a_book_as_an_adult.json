It was assigned in my sixth grade reading class, and although the first chapter was assigned, I read the whole thing the first weekend. It introduced me to science fiction, but beyond that it completely engrossed me. Looking back, I remember the book being empowering and exciting. To be a child prodigy, to be shot into space to train for warfare, to be a champion in the battle room; all things I wished I could do. \n\nI pulled the book off the shelf for a re-read at age 30, and when I turned the last page I was soul-crushed. As an adult, the book is gut-wrenchingly sad. I'm not Ender anymore, I am a man watching this child from a distance. The isolation he experiences, the sense of duty without purpose, his lack of free will. There are themes that I couldn't see as a kid because I wanted to be Ender, I was Ender. More importantly, I lacked the maturity or experience to even recognize these themes. I was shocked at how much the book changed for me. Has anyone experienced this with other books?",
