Instead of trying to convince a bored group of high school seniors that <em>Dubliners</em> or anything by Faulkner was the epitome of riveting storytelling, you told us outright that some books simply don&#39;t appeal to certain readers.   </p>\n\n<p>Plus, you encouraged us to be honest with our feelings about the content we read. <em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison was a very heavy, emotionally-laden book, and was very much meant to be so, but you understood that different students would react to it differently. Things were spaced out to allow for some breathing room and generally more pleasant content. You understood there were certain novels or texts that a student didn&#39;t care for, and were okay with that. You allowed us to criticize the texts we read, as well as understand and appreciate them (to some extent, however minimal it may have been).  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for openly advocating for the <em>performance</em> of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, instead of just reading them like a typical novel. Being called out on the spot to act and read a character&#39;s lines was a bit stressful and awkward at times, but it really did make things more interesting and engaging. it wasn&#39;t full on acting since we were learning remotely, but damn, you did your best trying to make it work.  </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t say it enough- we need more teachers like you. I&#39;d also love to hear other&#39;s stories about their English/Literature/Reading teachers who deserve the praise. High School English isn&#39;t necessarily going to be a student&#39;s favorite subject, but I really do think you made more people comfortable with it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
