He lobs mom-jokes and then mutes people before they can respond? Goddamn.</p>\n\n<p>The writing itself is boring, and I find myself zoning out all the time. So far he&#39;s spent more time jerking his nostalgia boner and explaining what XP is than actually making me care about this goof-ass caricature of a dweeb.</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s 2047 and everyone is playing Atari games looking for a hint to the 250 billion dollar prize left by a dead videogame genius. Alright whatever. Explain to me how there isn&#39;t an AI that can solve this shit in 3 days. It&#39;s 50 years in the future. Fuck man. This isn&#39;t a plot.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and to prove the one guy is an asshole he calls another guy &quot;twink&quot; and &quot;f*g&quot; and it&#39;s like what the fuck, that&#39;s pure lazy, shitty writing. It&#39;s been 50 years, there&#39;s no way there aren&#39;t cool new insults.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like some dude gargled Dungeons &amp; Dragons, The Matrix, and the 80&#39;s and then vomited by accident so it&#39;s just... awful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
