On the surface one would think that the life of an ordinary literature professor with a troubled marriage would not engage the reader for 278 pages.

But what I do know is that this book not only moved me with its story, but also taught me a few things about love, family and one's dedication to his/her life pursuit.\n\nThis is all I could write about the book for now, but there are tons of thoughts fluttering in my mind.
