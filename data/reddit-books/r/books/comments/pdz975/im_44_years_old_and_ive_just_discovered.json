I got so many magazines from the library that I eventually had to cut my subscriptions in half, I just couldn&#39;t read them all. The same app has audiobooks but I never bothered to check any out.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t even know what eventually motivated me to do it, but this year I finally checked one out.</p>\n\n<p>My life is transformed. Anytime I&#39;m doing something that I used to listen to music for, it&#39;s now audiobooks. If I&#39;m in the kitchen (I live alone), I&#39;ve got an audiobook on. If I go for a walk, I listen to a book. I almost wish I had a commute, so I could listen to more audiobooks. If I could be listening to a book but I&#39;m not, I feel like I&#39;m wasting my time.</p>\n\n<p>So far this year I&#39;ve read two physical books but I&#39;m closing in on ten audiobooks and I haven&#39;t even been at it all year. It&#39;s all been during time that I&#39;ve been doing other things. I just feel like I&#39;ve doubled productivity for a large portion of my life. I&#39;ve got 13 more on my holds list and another 120 tagged for interest.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
