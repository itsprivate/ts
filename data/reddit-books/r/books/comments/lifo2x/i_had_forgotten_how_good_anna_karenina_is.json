It's such an amazing character study, so engrossing and incisive. When I was young I enjoyed the drama but I was always bemused by everyone's actions and motives, especially Anna's who seemed pretty incomprehensible to me. But as an adult I felt such pity, empathy and love for all these characters, and I could finally understand how unhappy and stuck Anna was and why she felt compelled to act in such self-destructive ways.\n\nAlso another thing that surprised me was how interesting all the philosophy in the book was, like Levin commenting on how Russia had adopted European methods without adapting them, or his internal struggles trying to reconcile class divides, or his ruminations on what kind of life would bring him happiness. When I was a teen I was so bored by these slower introspective/philosophical chapters that I straight up skipped them, meanwhile now I was like *no wait, this is actually fascinating, go on* lol. Levin is my favourite character now, flaws and all.\n\nAnyway this book is considered a classic for a reason, and if you've somehow missed it I really recommend you give it a try. I've been obsessed with it for the past week, getting sucked into its sad but inevitable tragedy that makes you feel like you're reading about a very slow ~~train~~car crash, and I regret nothing. I think I'll give War and Peace a try after this which intimidated when I was young but I'm actually excited to start now.",
