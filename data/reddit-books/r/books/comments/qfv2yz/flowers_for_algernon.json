I know some may think it&#39;s not that profound, but for me I definitely believe it is a literary masterpiece, especially for it&#39;s time. I guess it&#39;s the whole concept of a lab experiment that takes a man from a mental retarded state to a rapid state of genius then back into the mire of darkness that really intrigues me. That, plus the star-crossed love story and the overall feel of a beatnik generation that it gives off. I highly recommend anybody to read read this novel; the gradual transition of Charlie&#39;s writing, is at first subtle, but your soon to notice him advancing in his grammar and thought processes quickly there after. The pace of the novel is amazing and though I feel the ending came at the right time, the writer (Daniel Keyes) had me yearning for more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
