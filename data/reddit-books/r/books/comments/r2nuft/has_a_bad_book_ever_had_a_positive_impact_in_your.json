However, it turns out that at that time I was a serious catholic boy who never questioned the standard interpretation of the Bible. That book was the first time I saw someone showing a different &quot;historical&quot; view of the OT. It was actually the first step that led me to actually read the Bible in a critical way, and later to my current atheism (that&#39;s a plus, in my opinion). In addition, I was interested in science and it happens that the book had an equation! The relativistic formula for time dilation. Independently of whatever bs the author was pushing, that formula blew my mind, and started a chain of events that eventually led to a PhD in Physics.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
