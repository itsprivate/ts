Can they not have more plot than romance?? So many male characters go by without any real reference to how attractive they are. But a woman appears and immediately we must know: is she hot? Almost always yes. Is she skinny, curvy or fat, how big are her breasts, how ‘scantily clad’ is she?? Someone told me to read Terry Pratchett for better portrayals of women and I’m a decent way into discworld and generally unimpressed. Even in this bizarre sci fi/fantasy/comedy women are described hornily and have subpar roles. Because even the most far flung fantasy must have patriarchy as a foundation.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Apparently this post is super controversial? Am I wrong to not want to hear about how attractive every female character is in extensive detail? Am I wrong to want better plots for them? \nThanks for the recommendations! (And thanks for the vitriol too I guess)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
