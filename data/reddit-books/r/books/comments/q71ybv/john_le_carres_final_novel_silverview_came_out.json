It was in a mostly completed state when he passed away, and his son (writer Nick Harkaway) ran it the last few steps to publication.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve just now finished it, and I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s a lot to put into words, but all of the hallmark le Carre elements are here -- disillusionment with the past, a gradual unveiling of hidden truths, and warm, needle-sharp characterization. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read any novel of his that felt so saturated in emotional ambiguity. As a final le Carre outing, I&#39;m interested to see the opinions that gradually roll out about this novel; I think as readers we sort of hope that an author&#39;s last work will bring a kind of finality to their catalogue, whether intentional or not, but reading this novel felt like standing at a window looking out on an uncertain horizon. That may not be for everyone, but it sent shivers up my spine, and I can&#39;t recommend it enough.  </p>\n\n<p>P.S.: And I&#39;ll never not take an opportunity to just generally suggest reading all of JlC&#39;s work if you have never tried it. He was an incredibly talented and consistent teller of human stories.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
