He could have easily said yeah you know what we’re going to commit you and that would have been it for her.. anyhow a good read but a difficult one. There were times I had to force myself to keep going but then BANG! It got super good and from there to the end it kept my attention. \n\nAt times I felt sorry for the creature that was created. It dawned on me that a self aware creature “born” into this world with no one to guide it was lucky to make it day to day. Some how it did. It was missing companionship and love. Those desires drove it to try to reach out for humans who shunned it because of its looks. (We do this to people everyday in the world). It was by that shunning that it became a monster.
