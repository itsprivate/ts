The challenge: who could write the best horror story. Mary won. Her own personal story is interesting and marked with tragedy. She died in 1851. \n\nWhile this was a good read and part of it pretty horrific by standards of those days... writings of creating a living creature through scientific methods were extremely taboo at that time. Honestly she could have been thrown into an insane asylum if her father hadn’t always encouraged her to write. He could have easily said yeah you know what we’re going to commit you and that would have been it for her.. anyhow a good read but a difficult one. There were times I had to force myself to keep going but then BANG! It got super good and from there to the end it kept my attention. \n\nAt times I felt sorry for the creature that was created. It dawned on me that a self aware creature “born” into this world with no one to guide it was lucky to make it day to day. Some how it did. It was missing companionship and love. Those desires drove it to try to reach out for humans who shunned it because of its looks. (We do this to people everyday in the world). It was by that shunning that it became a monster. In the end it hated itself more than its creator ever could. \n\nI’ll leave it there. Way more interesting than the movies made around the story.",
