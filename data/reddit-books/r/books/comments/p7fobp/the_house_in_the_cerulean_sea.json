He goes around from orphanage to orphanage to check on children and make sure they are okay. He doesn’t have any family or friends really and lives a humdrum life until he sent chosen to investigate a very special orphanage with special children and caretakers. </p>\n\n<p>That is all I can say without spoiling the book. For those of who are put off my fantasy, this is not a random young adult fantasy novel. Even though it has a lot of elements and magical creatures, I would say it’s more magical realism than anything. </p>\n\n<p>The prose is great, beautiful but simple enough to read fairly quickly and not seem pretentious. The characters are all so lovable and somehow real that they don’t quite seem like fictional characters even though most can do things humans can only dream of. The main character is quite likable in my opinion and has his own certain awkward charm. </p>\n\n<p>This is a very beautiful, one of a king story that I do not think can or will be replicated. If you’re looking for a decently quick read, I would suggest this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
