In Asimov's world, there are multiple separate machines and computers for specific tasks, while most of our daily tasks can be done on a single computer that fits in the palm of our hand. Books are stored on 'microfilms', whereas we have PDF-s and e-books nowadays. To put the difference into perspective, back in 1950-70, a \"well-read\" person's personal library could take up an entire room, with shelves sagging under the weight of all that paper. In Asimov's world, that would be about a shoebox's worth of microfilms. In our modern day, all of that can be stored on a piece of plastic the size of a fingernail called a MicroSD card.\n\nSo yeah... 1940s sci-fi is amazing and I highly recommend reading Asimov's works",
