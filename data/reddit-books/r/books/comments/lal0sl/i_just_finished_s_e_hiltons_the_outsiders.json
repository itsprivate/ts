I don’t think I’m ever gonna forget certain sections of this book for as long as I live.

The way that Dally loses it, hammering on the wall and letting everything out, throwing his hard exterior in that moment, it’s truly a powerful moment. “Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay Gold.” Johnny, man...goddamn it.\n\nI have heard for many, many years that this book is incredible but I just haven’t managed to get around to it until now. Let me just say, the wait was 100% worth it. What a read. It is truly something quite magnificent. A beautiful story.",
