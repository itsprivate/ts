It wasn&#39;t until I reread the first chapter again that everything just clicked. The tweeting of birds was more chilling at the realization that these were the only sounds you hear after a massacre and there isn&#39;t anything to say because no one is left to say it. I don&#39;t really have anyone to talk about this book with, so I just wanted to bring it up and see if anyone felt the same and had to reread the first chapter? </p>\n\n<p>Also, the Tralfamadores in the book really perplex me. Like are we supposed to interpret this as the best possible outlook that a person can have towards death and war. That we&#39;re just supposed to focus on the good times and accept some things as is? Or is this meant to be a coping mechanism Billy uses himself to accept what he&#39;s experienced? Is it a call back to how the character mentions that reality is boring compared to the science fiction books we read (something along those lines)?  Sorry, if my assumptions are stupid. I&#39;m just looking for some insight on how to interpret the story, especially the parts that take place off world, which are hard for me to fully grasp.  What is the significance of the Tralfamadores and the human zoo they had?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
