This one hits close to home in a way pretty much any other book I've read have never done so before. I was living in St. Louis, my birthplace & forever home, when  Michael Brown was murdered/shot & killed by Darren Wilson. I was working downtown when the jury came out, when the protests & then riots happened. The tension & fear was all too real & very close to home for me. It was in a word \"stressful\". My hometown that I love & would die by was thrown into national news with everyone speculating on what happened. I really thought I knew what was going on, but I was able to keep my personal self distant, thinking only about what route I would take to work, how business would be affected & how I would get home. Obviously being upset & outraged by the verdict, but somewhat removed. \n\nI feel silly, embarrassed, guilty.\n\n The Hate U Give is so well written in the voice of a teenage girl trying to get by, unnoticed, unsolicited, & completely normal. It felt like a diary of all my insecurities as a teenage girl. But it did something different by giving me the perspective of the girl next to me in my classes at my mostly white private school. All the uncomfortable things I dealt with plus the added burden of being a minority & having to present a certain way to not draw attention. The tension, the stress, the fear of worlds colliding or having one of your worlds explode in a way you can't control. Things I really have never had to deal with. It like I was by Starr's side, I felt her as a 16 year old girl & all of her frustration with her parents, her brothers & her friends. The perspective of being a young black girl in  America. It took hold of my attention in a way that few books I've read in recent years have. It makes me feel just that much more aware of the current state that my country is in. & I truly appreciate it for that & am so glad I finally read it.  \n\n\nTL;DR: The Hate U Give is an eyeopening, well written story of many young, vulnerable black girls & women in America. It's heartfelt, heart wrenching, but an easily relatable read if you want to get a glimpse into a life you don't live. A solid 12/10 read.",
