I’ve never been into books so I only recently got around to reading it. \nThe nonlinear storytelling was a little disorienting at first but eventually it became something that drew me in. The sudden transitions into different timelines throughout the 20th century gave the book an interesting tempo and allowed me to visit and revisit different parts of the story and piece them together. \nThe philosophical aspect of the narrative was intriguing as well. I kept trying to visualize how a Tramalfadorian sees in the fourth dimension and how it affects the way one understands ideas like time and death and existence.\nI’m surprised that my uncle was reading it to learn English cause it wasn’t exactly straightforward, though I guess it was pretty objective.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
