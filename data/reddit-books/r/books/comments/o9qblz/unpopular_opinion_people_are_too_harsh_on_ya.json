It&#39;s marketed to young adults and usually centered around them in terms of plot. The themes won&#39;t be too deep beyond &quot;good vs evil&quot; or &quot;forbidden love&quot; and tropes and so on. That&#39;s because it won&#39;t hold the attention of the average teen if it&#39;s too complicated or requiring a lot of literary skill to decipher. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not going to be &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; or &quot;Giovanni&#39;s Room&quot; concerning how the story is centered. As a young reader myself, I can admit that I&#39;m not extraordinarily fond of YA fiction. But it caters to a certain audience, so when I see adults reading it and then complaining about it feels odd since they weren&#39;t the target audience to begin with. If it has an interesting premise, sells well, and the plot is exciting enough and doesn&#39;t promote harmful behaviors, then I think it shouldn&#39;t be compared to books that were obviously going to be more critically acclaimed because they were meant for adults, and for adults to analyze. </p>\n\n<p>Of course people can critique books, but I just feel like expecting more than your standard YA fiction with romance, action, and good vs evil is setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
