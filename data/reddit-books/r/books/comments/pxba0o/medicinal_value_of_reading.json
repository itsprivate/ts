I have fairly severe nerve damage and chronic pain, that pain meds only go so far to deal with.  I found, though, that getting lost in a good book goes a long way to getting me out of my head for awhile and makes the pain ease up a lot better than watching TV or most anything else does.  Has anyone else used reading as medicine as well as enjoyment?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
