We see him crush a man&#39;s skull between his massive hands. We see him lift an immense iron meteorite and throw it 11 feet.</p>\n\n<p>This is how the kid died. He was enveloped utterly by this... thing. And <strong>crushed</strong>. That was Holden&#39;s will, to consume and envelope this apostate wholly, like the darkness McCarthy is so preoccupied by.</p>\n\n<p>The Judge took the kid into his flesh, and crushed him entirely. Imagine the scene in those jakes. A body reduced to a mutilated horror of blood and bone, barely human in shape. A pile of gore, brains exploded through the skull, torso crushed and misshapen.</p>\n\n<p>The witnesses wouldn&#39;t be able to comprehend what they were seeing. &quot;Oh my god&quot; would be the only appropriate response. One witness asks &quot;what is it?&quot; They cannot be certain that the remains are even human.</p>\n\n<p>It is commonly believed that the killing was sexual in nature due to Holden&#39;s nakedness. Yet he is frequently naked throughout the novel. It is not inherently sexual. Holden is a child murderer and pederast, but there is no indication that he would rape a grown man.</p>\n\n<p>Holden&#39;s nakedness is Biblical. <strong>A thing naked is a thing revealed</strong>. The Judge is unveiled in those jakes, and swallows the kid (now the man) into his flesh, leaving some unrecognizable, bloodied mass of flesh and shattered bone lying on the floor of that outhouse.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
