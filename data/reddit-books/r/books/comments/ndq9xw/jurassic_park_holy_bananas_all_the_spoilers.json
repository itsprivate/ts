Not a strong recommendation, but it did remind me that I had the Audible version downloaded a while ago, and I thought, why not? I love the movie.\n\nWell...  The book was so much better.  (Common occurrence, I know, but bare with me; I was 6 when the movie came out). I love the science discussions and the personifications in characters.  I love that Sattler was not together with Grant.  I love that John Hammond was so so HATEABLE and the Donald Genero was actually a really decent protagonist. I am an attorney and we get so much hate in film.  I love that even if he was late to the party, he was in the right and did the right things.\n\nI loved, and was shocked, that Ian Malcom died! Yes, I know he comes back which I think is a disservice to this book.  His death was especially poignant because he was in the right the whole time.  It was a beautiful and necessary tragedy that a protagonist had to die.\n\nA final note on Lex- she was 8 and in this impossible scenario.  She doesn't really understand death at that point, but I don't think was a completely worthless character.  I think she was a reminder of the innocence at stake.  Tim was on the cusp of maturity forced even higher because of his home circumstances, but Lex was still really pure.  Are 8 year olds annoying? You bet, but to me she was sympathetic.",
