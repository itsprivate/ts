Well, when I finished it, it wasn&#39;t the case for me, but then, I read the reviews and discussions about this book on goodreads, from that moment I cannot get over the fact that I am so dumb.

I always try to draw conclusions from what I&#39;ve read and not not from what the author might actually be trying to portray. </p>\n\n<p>So anyone can help me about how to read smartly and how to actually understand stories in more depth and not read literally and how to draw better interpretations and conclusions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
