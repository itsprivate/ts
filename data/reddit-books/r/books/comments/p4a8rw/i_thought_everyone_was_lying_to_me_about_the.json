I don&#39;t know how Dumas manages to write 1200 pages of nonstop action and intrigure &amp; I am in awe! Les Mis is around the same length, and as much as I loved it, there were definitely parts where Hugo went off on long tangents and my eyes sort of glazed over.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously there were some parts of the book that have aged poorly, but on the whole it was an incredible journey and I&#39;m so glad I finally picked it up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
