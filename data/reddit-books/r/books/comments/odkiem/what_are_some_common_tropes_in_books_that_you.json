However, this time their growth is showcased in a tangible way when they use what they&#39;ve learned on their journey to easily solve the problem that previously had caused them so much grief. It feels so cathartic, especially seeing the characters from the beginning of the story be impressed by it.</p>\n\n<p>What is a trope that you love to see even if you&#39;ve perhaps seen it many times before and has become predictable?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
