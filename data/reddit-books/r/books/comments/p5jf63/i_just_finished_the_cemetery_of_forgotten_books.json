I was so immersed in the lives of the Semperes and friends and the city of Barcelona. I really enjoyed how Zafon tied up all the loose ends of the story and showed us the continuation of the Sempere family and the Cemetery of Forgotten books. My heart will always break for Julian Carax, he was such a tortured character but I think he found peace in the end by working with Julian Sempere.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
