He also calls cultures \"mental parasites\" and goes on to say agricultural revolution was \"history's biggest fraud\" and praises the foraging/hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and explains how those people were in much better physical shape and enjoyed a larger variety of nutrients and how they were much happier than let's say today's white collar workers. The fact that people have become taller, smarter and enjoy longer and longer lifespans since we've settled down into organised communities and started cultivating crops and animals is disregarded all together. Or the fact that when your whole life is about survival and moving from one place to another you have very little time for philosophy or to write publications such as this one. \n\nHe then proceeds to go all the way to science fiction territory talking about superhumans in the future and cybertech and whatnot and goes on to suggest that human ingenuity will prevail, whilst bashing the direction mankind has been following so far so that is kind of a contradiction. \n\nI could go on with the gross assumptions based on the writer's own idea of an ideal word, that can pretty much be summed up by listening to \"Imagine\" by John Lennon plus living a nomadic lifestyle.\n\nWhy this book is regarded so highly is beyond me.",
