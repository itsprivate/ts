This is truly the greatest novel I have ever read and I’m glad I waited till now that I’m in my later 40s. I feel as though I can appreciate it more. I’m amazed at how Tolstoy is able to describe the slight loss of love that happens after a new infatuation.  When Anna returns from Moscow and describes how her husbands ears seem weird and even describes her own child slightly less glowing as before she went to Moscow.  As someone whom has lived life and experienced similar things, I read that and realize the human condition is and has been the same throughout history. This is truly the best thing I’ve read in my life so far !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
