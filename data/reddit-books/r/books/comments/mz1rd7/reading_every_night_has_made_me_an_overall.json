For the first half of grad school, I was really anxious and would have trouble falling and staying sleeping too. A couple of years ago (halfway into grad school), I was going on a solo trip and decided to pick a book or two to read while alone on this trip. I picked two thrillers and after this trip, I became addicted to reading more mystery/crime/thriller novels, trying to read at least a little bit each night. Not only does it help me fall asleep but every day I feel a pang of happiness about the fact that I get to return to my exciting book at night and this happiness seems to indirectly affect my general mood.\n\nI also think the Kindle (or e-reader) and the library's overdrive are the greatest inventions ever because I can read about a book a week without ever having to leave my bed. I also very recently started checking out thriller audiobooks (that I read separately from but in parallel with my nighttime book) from my library to listen to at the gym and it makes my workouts so much more bearable.\n\nI read for pure enjoyment and it made me realize that finding the right genre(s) for each individual person is so important. Some people may find it hard to get through a book and get turned off of reading for a while but I believe they are just reading the wrong type of book and that there is a genre out there they will get sucked into like I did.\n\n(I had a brief hiatus from thrillers last year to re-read the entire Harry Potter series and that contributed the same amount of happiness and excitement.)\n\nDo others have similar experiences and thoughts?",
