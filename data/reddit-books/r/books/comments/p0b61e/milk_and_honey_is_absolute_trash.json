I haven&#39;t read alot of it as I find it sometimes too difficult to understand what the author is trying to say.</p>\n\n<p>However, Milk and Honey just seems to go in the opposite direction by literally just putting words that make sense one after the other to which people exclaim &quot;this is the best thing I have ever read&quot; or &quot;Milk and Honey changed my life&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Can someone describe my feelings more eloquently than me? Am I alone in this? My own theory is that people like Milk and Honey for the same reason they - and this is controversial - like the Alchemist. Which is to say that they&#39;re both easy to read, easy to understand, and therefore people who don&#39;t read alot all of sudden can say they&#39;ve read and understood something.</p>\n\n<p>In fact I&#39;ll go as far as to say that if you like Milk and Honey you are quite frankly immoral. Just kidding (actually, maybe not).</p>\n\n<p>So what do you guys think? Am I being too harsh? Should I just let people enjoy what they enjoy?.</p>\n\n<p>Also, one final thing. Why does Rupi Kaur goddamn recite her poetry like that?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
