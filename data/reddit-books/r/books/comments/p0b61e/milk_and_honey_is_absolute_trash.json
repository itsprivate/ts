Am I alone in this? My own theory is that people like Milk and Honey for the same reason they - and this is controversial - like the Alchemist. Which is to say that they&#39;re both easy to read, easy to understand, and therefore people who don&#39;t read alot all of sudden can say they&#39;ve read and understood something.</p>\n\n<p>In fact I&#39;ll go as far as to say that if you like Milk and Honey you are quite frankly immoral. Just kidding (actually, maybe not).</p>\n\n<p>So what do you guys think? Am I being too harsh? Should I just let people enjoy what they enjoy?.</p>\n\n<p>Also, one final thing. Why does Rupi Kaur goddamn recite her poetry like that?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
