I should mention that he hadn’t read any of those books himself and just relied on reviews. One of them was “The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches” by a Canadian writer Gaétan Soucy. I had a habit of randomly picking a book in our home “library” and reading it without looking at reviews first. Guess what, one day I chose this book. </p>\n\n<p>From the very beginning, I didn’t understand what was going on. The plot was so tangled, and the grammar was not a thing. However, this weird book caught my attention for some reason. </p>\n\n<p>As I continued reading, everything was getting clearer, which was so satisfying. The language had become so beautiful that I was writing lots of quotes down! </p>\n\n<p>Further, the plot became super tense, which kept me even more thrilled! And suddenly... the BRUTAL denouement. </p>\n\n<p>I told my mom about this book to see her reaction when she finishes it. She is not a susceptible person, but the ending shocked her. Eventually, this book ended up in our fireplace.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
