This book by Carl Sagan had been on my to-read list for a long time when I finally got my hands on it. The book was published in 1995 and he authored it along with his wife Ann Druyan.\n\nThe book can be divided, arbitrarily, into two parts. He begins by extolling the scientific method as the best possible thing that humans have been able to come up with. Then for most of the first part, he dwells on debunking the various arguments pertaining to extraterrestrial life and UFOs. In the process, he taps into a motley of human shortcomings throughout the time humans have been here and also provides a rational argument for them. He ends the first part with the feedback he received, for the chapters as they were published in another magazine, Parade. Then he presents his famous Baloney Detection kit to help the readers spot various aberrations in the arguments and to develop a sound clear thinking for themselves. In the next part, he presents various arguments that are given against science and elaborates why they don’t hold much merit. He presents science as the future of the human race and shows why is it important to celebrate and preach it.\n\nIt is not just any other interesting read but a life-changing experience. As you follow through with arguments presented in the book, you begin to question your own beliefs. Work is accomplished well by the author. He debunks popular human superstitions like UFO visits, crop circles, alien abductions but in doing so never does he mock those who hold such beliefs. Instead, he modestly highlights the rationales behind those beliefs and agrees that no one is immune to such false beliefs. Rather he stresses that even the authorities can be wrong and that is why science has no authority. For some parts or some chapters, it felt like a drag and it felt like the author was being superfluous with his arguments and cycling back to the same chain of thought. But it is understandable that when you have to nail down a belief you have to hit the hammer hard and repeatedly. The language, clear, embellished, and entertaining, makes up for that repetitiveness. The author creates magic by putting word after word to bring up sentences that leave a lasting impression.\n\nI would recommend this book to everyone. This book has definitely converted me to its ways. I am such a strong proponent of this book now that I believe, as the author, that a few things like the “Baloney detection kit” must be taught to students in the school. This book is a way for us to foster skepticism and rational thinking right from the starting years. The best seller deserves more. More than billions and billions copy must be sold of this book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as dumb question.* \\- Carl Sagan",
