When i&#39;m like this i can&#39;t feel the enjoyment of the moment and everything i do, or want to do, feels like a drag and then i question even if i like doing those things. Which leads me to identity crises but i&#39;m going off topic. I started therapy and antidepressants but sadly they don&#39;t make much difference. Maybe i need to change therapist.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that i also have dyslexia. It adds a friction to my reading but it doesn&#39;t make it very hard. Just irritating.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
