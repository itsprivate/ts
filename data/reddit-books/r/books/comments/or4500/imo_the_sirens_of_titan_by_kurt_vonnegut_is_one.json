My dad showed me “Cat’s Cradle” and said he had read it in college, and so I gave it a shot, and I loved it. </p>\n\n<p>Then I read quite a few more books by Vonnegut, as well as lots of other classic literature. But even after all that I’ve read, “The Sirens of Titan” has consistently been among my favorites. I think it just has such a great message, especially towards the end of the book when Salo says that “a purpose of human life. . . is to love whoever is around to be loved.”</p>\n\n<p>And how Vonnegut almost laughs in the face of religion, I find interesting. Especially with the prayer of the Reverend C. Horner Redwine.</p>\n\n<p>Messages aside, I really think the story is super captivating. It tells a story that incorporates so many elements of science fiction, but everything is kept so strangely humanized. Real-life conflicts and events that question human behavior are shown, and yet, the storyline is almost typical. A super-rich guy is pretty much forced to go to Mars, then Mercury, then back to Earth, and then to Titan, where he will eventually die, and all under the watch of a supernatural, mind-reading mentor. Of course, I am simplifying it, but that’s the gist of it.</p>\n\n<p>There is sooooo much more to this book than what I have said here. As I said, this book remains with my top 3 books ever; I do think it is at least worth a shot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
