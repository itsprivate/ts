Yet it seems no one has really dove into the rest of Remarque&#39;s works which is a real shame as I consider some of them to be equal to All Quiet and perhaps even better. </p>\n\n<p>For example, &quot;Three Comrades&quot;, a love story combined with a story of true friendship set in post-ww1 Germany sees Remarque take on romance and more personal relationships. I thought it was a killer book that was better than All Quiet with a much wider range of topics, emotions, and themes. </p>\n\n<p>Another great one is &quot;The Black Obelisk,&quot; a darkly humorous novel about a tombstone salesman during the Inflationary era of the Weimar Republic. I thought the jokes and the comedy were really well done and there are some truly scathing criticisms of religion, the political system, and German culture as well. There is still the characteristic Remarque grimness we all come to expect.</p>\n\n<p>I just finished &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot;, which can be considered an updated-for-ww2 version of All Quiet. I don&#39;t have much to say about it as I&#39;m still thinking about it but needless to say it is worth a read. War is mercilessly attacked even more so than in All Quiet and I would even consider it a pacifist masterpiece.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve read a lot of great books from a lot of great authors, some of which probably are better than any of Remarque&#39;s works. However, I&#39;ve yet to find an author as consistently great as Remarque, which is why he&#39;s my favorite.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
