It’s about the special way that dawn spreads out across a river when you know you must cross that river and walk into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do.” And I get the chills. Even now, I look at that and go damn. What a good frickin quote. Deep but not too complicated. Heartfelt without being preachy. How did he even think of that? I’m jealous of the skill but like, 10/10. I can’t find a single thing wrong with it no matter how hard I try. \n\nI know this book has been out for decades, but I recently picked it up after not reading it for a few years, and idk if it’s because I work in emergency services now or if it’s because I’m almost 30, but it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I think I cried like four times, and that’s saying a lot for me.\n\nIf you haven’t read this book, please check it out. I promise you won’t regret it.",
