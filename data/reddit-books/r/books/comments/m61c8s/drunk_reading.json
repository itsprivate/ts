I drank so much that I would pass out reading and think I had finished the book I was reading. I would wake up the next day and reread the ending to make sure I had finished the whole thing.  A lot of the time I would discover that I had dreamed a completly different ending. The endings in my dreams were so real and tired together so well with the original story that I would be surprised. Use to love being able to finish a book and then comparing my story with the authors. My own private book club of sorts. At last I don&#39;t drink like that any more (my family and my liver rejoice) but thought I would share to see if anyone else has ever experienced a similar situation?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
