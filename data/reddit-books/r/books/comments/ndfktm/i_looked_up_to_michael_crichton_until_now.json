He was so creative and relatively scientific in his work, and had such a unique tone and mood that stayed consistent. \n\nThen I read State of Fear. I’m still reading it, actually. But I’m less than a hundred pages from finishing, so I’m confident I have the jist. For those who don’t know, State of Fear is basically Michael Crichton’s climate changer denier manifesto disguised as a thriller. I didn’t know that. To me, it was a book with a cool cover. Overall, it’s solid. The plot is good, and entertaining contradictory ideas is good. But it really falls apart when Crichton’s insert character, Kenner, intermittently goes on painfully long rants and arguments with the environmentalists. And you’d think, if arguing a point using an insert, you would try and make him not incredibly pretentious. On top of that, to give perspective, the book has an extensive bibliography, and there are many footnotes. Almost all of the footnotes are for evidence in Kenner’s rants and arguments. Like Crichton’s trying to convince the reader of his ideas in the most fucking obnoxious and condescending way. \n\nI will still read Michael Crichton and love his works, but I really needed to get that out.\n\nTo make this a community thing, are there any authors who had works that tarnished, no matter how much or little, their reputation to you?",
