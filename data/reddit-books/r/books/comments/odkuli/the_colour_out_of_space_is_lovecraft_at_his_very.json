  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So for a bit of context, I have been steadily working my way through the Necronomicon collection of Lovecraft&#39;s &#39;best weird stories&#39;, and generally enjoying them only as much as I expect to - up to a point, most of the stories run to a straightforward formula of: anonymous but wholesome WASP man finds something mysterious and horrifying and escapes with his life but not his sanity; also there&#39;s loads of extremely, stunningly racist rhetoric for some reason (The Rats in the Walls and your irrelevant little &#39;self-insert&#39;, I&#39;m looking at you).</p>\n\n<p>But THIS story is utterly on another level - it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing I picture when I think of &#39;Cosmic Horror&#39;, and everything about it is written so incredibly perfectly. In short, <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">a meteorite made of a strangely coloured metal lands on a New England farm. Scientists who come to investigate it inadvertently release a nameless horror into the surrounding countryside, which proceeds to literally suck the life out of plants, animals, and, eventually, the human inhabitants of the farm.</span> I could go into extensive detail about every tiny tidbit that I love about this story, but I will just say two things that really stood out to me - the first is that The Colour Out of Space is a divergence from the essentially gothic, fantastical, &#39;ghouls-and-demons&#39; style of Lovecraft&#39;s other works. It comes across as genuine cosmic horror, and his choice to make the &#39;thing&#39; into a nebulous, gaseous, faceless alien is far more effective in making it &#39;indescribable&#39;, imo, than some big scary monster with tentacles.</p>\n\n<p>The second stand-out feature is that <em>There Is No Racism In This Short Story And It Is Vastly Improved By Its Absence</em> - seriously, when Lovecraft isn&#39;t trying to tell his reader that every non-white person on the face of the earth is a horrible devil-worshipping caricature, his writing is markedly superior (how shocking). Who could have guessed that simply not trying to stuff piles of worthless eugenicist bullshit into your stories about scary monsters could make your work easier to read??!</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, check out the Colour Out of Space, it&#39;s super good</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
