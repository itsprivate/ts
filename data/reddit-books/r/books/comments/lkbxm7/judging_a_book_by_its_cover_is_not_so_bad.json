As the saying goes \"don't judge a book by its cover\", be we end (or at least I do) up judging a cover by its book, blaming it for making us buy a book we don't like. But the artist is just doing its job and doing it well, and we (I) often don't recognise it. \n\nMy new resolution is to sometime buy books based only on the cover in recognition of the artist efforts, they deserve it. I don't know if they get a share based on the copies sold, but anyway its marketing done right and they should be proud.\n\nWhat's your take on this?",
