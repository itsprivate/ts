Reasonably short but absolutely full to the brim with story, the descriptions were intricate and poetic, the letters were so fun it was really like reading correspondence between two soldiers/lovers, I&#39;ve never been one for time travel story with how confusing things can get but I feel like the time travel aspect was handled quite smoothly. Red and Blue&#39;s relationship was sooo goood they way they were intricately woven into eachothers lives ;;w;; </p>\n\n<p>The dystopian aspect of their respective lives was also so interesting, Garden made me think of the eco cult in Margaret Atwoods Oryx and Crake series and Commandment made me think of big brother in 1984, it was interesting to see how they contrasted and yet were quite similar. </p>\n\n<p>I just feel like the whole book was reading a work of poetry. Anyways totally a 5/5</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
