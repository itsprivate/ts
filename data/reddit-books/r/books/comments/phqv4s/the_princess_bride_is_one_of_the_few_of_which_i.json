There were so many things I love about the book and its movie.</p>\n\n<p>One of the great things about The Princess Bride was the characters. Each of them have their own individualities and the casts of the movie just made it better! There&#39;s a reason why TPB was always mentioned on discussions about perfect casting. The casts really brought more life to the book characters.</p>\n\n<p>There were many details in the book that were unfortunately not included in the movie, e.g. Prince Humperdinck&#39;s &quot;marriage proposal&quot; to Buttercup and how the story was told from the point of view of the omniscient narrator (this was the first time I read a book in this writing style and I really really enjoyed reading the narrator&#39;s shenanigans). BUT if there was one thing that the movie made iconic, then it&#39;s R.O.U.S! When those things came out of the movie, I was not prepared. I thought I was, but I was not.</p>\n\n<p>The Princess Bride has a special place in my heart and one of the few books that I want to have a physical copy of and pass on to the next generation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
