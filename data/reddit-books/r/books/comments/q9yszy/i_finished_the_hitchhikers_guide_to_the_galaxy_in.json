My favourite book in the series was Book 6, it was written by Eoin Colfer. The first five books were penned by Douglas Adams.<br/>\nAll the books in this series are hilarious. Douglas Adams&#39; books are more so than Eoin Colfer&#39;s in my opinion. But the last book would be easier to read because it&#39;s more neatly laid out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
