Sure you got trite cliches like a chosen one and a dark evil entombed but rising up. But then you also get great goodies like the despicable wild card Padan Fain or the Seanchan randomly showing up to enslave everyone. </p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s book five that just opens with us checking in on every antagonistic group, from the self righteous Whitecloaks to the man hating Red Ajah to the Forsaken chilling and plotting against each other to all the Dark Friends meeting in masks. That stuff gets me giddy because it sets up all these wonderful pieces to come in conflict...</p>\n\n<p>.... and then I have to read in excruciating detail how Rand couldn&#39;t find his socks</p>\n\n<p>Again. </p>\n\n<p>I swear there are some passages that read like this: </p>\n\n<p>&quot; Perrin sat up. Perrin put his feet on the floor. Perrin walked to the door. Perrin put his hand in the door knob. Perrin twisted the door knob. Perrin opened the door. Perrin stepped out of the door. Perrin closed the door. Perrin took his hand off the door knob&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Those are the moments that made me scream YEAH WE CAN INFER THESE THINGS </p>\n\n<p>But still, I powered through it. Because the pay offs were so great. Nothing more satisfying than seeing the smug Seanchan taken down or Thom doing something amazing with knives. </p>\n\n<p>Then it happened. </p>\n\n<p>The Ai&#39;el villain they built up all of book four...</p>\n\n<p>Who was becoming a real problem in book five...</p>\n\n<p>Everything leading to an epic confrontation....</p>\n\n<p>Cut to: Oh yeah Matt fought and killed him offscreen. It was cool. You should have been there for it. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when I gave up </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s one thing to go into extremely boring detail about mundane things....but to do that AND skip over something actually exciting? </p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t do it anymore </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I have hope for the show. Because theres so many fun characters and potential for great scenes and now I&#39;ll get to enjoy it without reading about Rand looking for his socks yet again. </p>\n\n<p>Plus they casted The Professor from LA CASA DE PAPEL as Logain and that&#39;s one character who NEVER got enough screen time so I&#39;m looking forward to seeing more of him. </p>\n\n<p>Any other WHEEL OF TIME people feel the same way? Or do you all hate me for giving up?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
