Since then, 13 years have passed, I’ve seen the trend of speed reading skyrocket and have tried multiple times to learn speed reading.  </p>\n\n<p>However, recently I had a realization that I had read an entire book and felt like I only really comprehended half of what I had read.  So I decided to slow down my reading and really enjoy every page instead of treating my reading like a sprint I would treat it more like a marathon.  </p>\n\n<p>What I’ve come to realize is that my reading comprehension goes up when I slow down my reading and read at a pace that’s comfortable for me.  I also feel like I get a lot more enjoyment out of my reading as well as I’m not attempting to rush through it.  </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else had this experience?  Is there a reason that this could be the case?  What does the research say?  </p>\n\n<p>By the way, some people could be really great speed readers and that could be your preferred style!  That’s ok too.  I just want to remind people that going against trends or against the grain is ok if it works for you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
