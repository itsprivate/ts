The other day we had a discussion on book-lists and they claimed the must-read book lists are a scam perpetuated by men and most of them were written by cis-het white men. I tried telling them that Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Proust's works have a great merit in themselves and they have stood the test of time and they are not supposed to be rejected simply because those authors were men. They were of the opinion that those books were read only by red-pill incels and those books are not inclusive at all; on the other hand, the current YA fiction works are relatable and inclusive and have far more merit. I could not articulate my thoughts at the moment to counter their arguments because I was afraid of sounding condescending and snobbish. They were also of the opinion that there was no such thing as objective literature, and Twilight was as good as Anna Karenina, and it was just an opinion that the latter is a great book and there is no objective measures in literature to prove AK is better than Twilight because writing is subjective. How to let them know there are objective measures and classics exist not just because they were written by men but they have merit in themselves and relevant till now?",
