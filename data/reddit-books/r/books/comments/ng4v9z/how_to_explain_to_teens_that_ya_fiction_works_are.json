I could not articulate my thoughts at the moment to counter their arguments because I was afraid of sounding condescending and snobbish. They were also of the opinion that there was no such thing as objective literature, and Twilight was as good as Anna Karenina, and it was just an opinion that the latter is a great book and there is no objective measures in literature to prove AK is better than Twilight because writing is subjective. How to let them know there are objective measures and classics exist not just because they were written by men but they have merit in themselves and relevant till now?",
