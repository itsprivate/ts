Ideally I would get my tubes tied, and really wish I had just been born sterile. So the idea of my spirituality residing in the exact reproductive organs I loathe having every month sort of makes me feel like I don't belong to the womanhood ideal she's writing about. I don't feel like the \"light of my life\", as the author calls it, comes from the same organ that causes me incredible pain and suffering.\n\nWhich is fine, if that's how she feels and what she believes. I know this is just my own take based on my own feelings, no shame to the author.\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else has read the book and if this is will be a common theme? I was sort of hoping for a book more on the wild woman archetype *spiritually* rather than focusing on how that's related to reproduction, birth, seeds, etc. I feel like we get reduced to that enough already and was hoping for something a little different. Especially since the author hammers home that this is a book for all women, and that the Wild Woman archetype is inherently all women, it doesn't really feel like that is true here. \n\n**Has anyone read the book too?
