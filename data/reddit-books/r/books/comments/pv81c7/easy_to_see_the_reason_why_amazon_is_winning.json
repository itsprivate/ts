Thought I&#39;d use an independent book shop so they would get my money and not a big corporation like Amazon...</p>\n\n<p>They had to order them in as they don&#39;t stock them.. Understandable. \nThey finally came in after a week or so and were shipped out via pretty slow mail method.. Okay fair enough, faster is costly I guess.\nAfter over a week of waiting only half actually arrived. So now the whole process has to be started again for the missing books.</p>\n\n<p>So far it&#39;s taken the best part of two weeks and I only have half of what I originally ordered.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not complaining as such as I prefer these people get the money and not big corporations but it&#39;s pretty obvious that a good majority of people wouldn&#39;t put up with this when you can just buy on Amazon and have the item pretty much next day.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this is just my personal experience of trying to shop away from Amazon etc and my thoughts about it. It won&#39;t stop me from using independent sellers but it has given me insight.</p>\n\n<p>Edit. Again I just want to make clear, this post is just intended to promote open discussion about the subject and my observations of buying. This observation won&#39;t put me off buying local and independent. </p>\n\n<p>PS. Use your local libraries too people 😊</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
