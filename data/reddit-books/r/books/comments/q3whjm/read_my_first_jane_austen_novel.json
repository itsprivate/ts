My expectation initially was that it was going to be a boring and tedious read but when finished I was pleasantly surprised.  Being educated in America, I have a little trouble with unabridged novels because although I understood mostly everything there were at times when I felt a little lost and some background information would have been helpful to understand the totality of the literature.  I did not find the characters or the story particularly interesting but I did find Austen&#39;s commentary on relations very insightful.  I think the last line of the book sums it up very nicely, &quot;I leave it to be settled by whomsoever it may concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.&quot;  Despite the era of Jane Austen being behind us I think her commentary and insights on relations are still applicable to today.  Next Austen novel I read will be Pride and Prejudice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
