I’m from Germany and history is obviously a very important subject in school / the country, so I knew most about her life &amp; WWII already. I read some pages in high school because it was mandatory to do so, but I never finished it. Back then my mind was occupied with other things. Which is why I decided to give it another read, when I saw the title on a list on Goodreads.\n\nI am 20 years now, recently purchased the book and read the last 200 pages in one night, which left me devastated, in shock and in sadness. Crazy how a \"simple\" diary can give you a rollercoaster of emotions. Its even crazier how a girl of 13-15 years can write a book, that has that kind of impact on society. But I don't think I need to go into further details, everyone knows how great the book is.\n\n**\\[personal experience/thoughts\\]**\n\nFor me personally, it was so hard to see a girl with aspirations, goals and optimistic characteristics, die at such a young age.\n\nEven though I knew it would happen, the last sentence of the diary hit me so hard. I wanted to know even more about her, because I was relating to her thoughts and views on life so much. I relate to problems she has and while I know that I need to solve them myself, I felt like she can provide some sort of solution.\n\nI am in University now and Anne Frank (and her diary) is 24/7 on my mind, I can't even focus on my work and I'm just too unmotivated to read another book. I thought that if I go on a run I could clear my head, but nothing works... I guess it really takes time to heal :)\n\nNormally I prefer fictional series, and I think it's so hard on me because this actually happened. I'm actually so ashamed and angry about the crimes my ancestors committed.\n\n**\\[ending\\]**\n\nI will soon visit her grave and leave her a letter, which hopefully gives me some closure.\n\nHow do you guys deal with a heartbreaking book? Did you feel the same?\n\nthank you for reading, have a good day or good night!\n\n\n\n**\\[edit\\]**\n\nedit: this post really relieved me and gave me some closure already lol, \n\nedit: i needed to structure this post, bc it was really unsettling for me, to see a unorganized mess",
