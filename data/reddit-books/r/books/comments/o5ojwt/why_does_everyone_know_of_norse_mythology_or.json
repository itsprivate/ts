This is an obscure book that I have been following on forums for a long time, but I am so excited now that it is finally released. The Kalevala can be attributed, at least partially, to a ton of the archetypes we see in fantasy today. In large part, that’s due to the fact it inspired Tolkien and quite a few elements, and even some characters, of the Lord of the Rings come right out of the Kalevala. Despite that, it seems like no one knows about it! I remember reading Beowulf in school TWICE and never even knew about the Finnish epic poems. Is that common everywhere? </p>\n\n<p>Well now there’s at least a series set within that mythos! I downloaded it already today and read some before work and can’t wait to finish. The author is a diplomat who worked in Finland and the attention to detail in the beginning of the book was phenomenal. I hope these books make the Kalevala more well known, because I think it’s so underrepresented right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
