Most books on the topic seemed a bit daunting, but I believe that Fry has provided a perfect first read. No prior knowledge or understanding was required to appreciate the myths and to enjoy not only the stories but his light hearted, humorous writing style. I would truly recommend this book to anyone who wants to take their first step into the world of Greek myths.",
