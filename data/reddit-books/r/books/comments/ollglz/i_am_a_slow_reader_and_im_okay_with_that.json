I carry my book with me so I read when I get a moment but it’s hard. </p>\n\n<p>I love literature, reading and writing are my passions. I find beauty in literature. </p>\n\n<p>Just because I’m not fast does not make me less of a lover of reading. It does not make me “dumb” and I’m content with enjoying reading and not trying to prove that I’m somehow the “best” at reading by bragging how quick I binge read books. </p>\n\n<p>Literature is about enjoyment and personal growth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
