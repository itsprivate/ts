First, if you haven&#39;t read the book, I highly highly recommend it. Its a very quick read with short chapters. I don&#39;t want to give too much of the plot away because I went into it blind and really enjoyed reading the story unfold. </p>\n\n<p>Although published in 1962 it could just have well be written last year.  I&#39;ve also read Breakfast of Champions this year. Both books were good but I think Mother Night is much better story telling <em>overall</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t really know anything about Vonnegut before this year and I can&#39;t wait to read more. I&#39;m willing to discuss more in the comments but I didnt want to give too much away for those who havent read it yet.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
