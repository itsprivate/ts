Someone had stated that ‘Steinbeck writes in a way where the words just flow off the page like butter’ and ‘I don’t know what it is about Steinbeck but his writing instantly makes me forget about everything around me.’. These two resonate with me. </p>\n\n<p>Being closer to 40 than I was yesterday, I feel like if I’d read this in my 20’s I’d have thoroughly enjoyed it, but certain themes would have been lost to me. Not that I’d have been confused, the subtleties might literally have not awakened in me the emotions that I’d feel now. Similarly, if I’d have read this in my 50s or 60s, I think I may recognize additional themes that might’ve eluded me upon reading in my 30s. It’s just that this book travels so deeply into a certain time and human condition that there must be enjoyment and enlightenment to be discovered at nearly any age, and each decade may house a secret to be unraveled. </p>\n\n<p>A couple of the characters have such profound philosophies, and if feels so natural when they are conversing and questioning the world around them. For an author to conceive these characters, their train of thought, their ideals and motivations…it’s truly a wonder to me how rich in life and real they seem. And for them alone to have you nodding your head, or pondering their words is wonderful. The quotability held within the pages has no end.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I only know that I loved this novel. It may be the best I’ve read. But who am I…\nIf you have this on your list, dear reader, I’m excited for you and the road ahead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
