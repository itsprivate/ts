It has become a fun challenge just for me, and now my family has taken an interest!

I have no plan other than books my friends and family recommend, or things laying around that interest me. I plan on refining my approach in the future, but having this little goal for myself has brought me so much happiness and I wanted to share. Do you have book goals or challenges too?!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
