It's not it's plot as their isn't really one. It's just how raw it is. Henry is both sympathetic and pathetic. I relate so much to him when he complains about bureaucracy and having to fake being interested in your job to your employer. He also seems hopeless for not planning a way out. But that's sort of the thing about this book, there are people who put up with the grind and die. It's horrifying and funny and brutally hoenst.",
