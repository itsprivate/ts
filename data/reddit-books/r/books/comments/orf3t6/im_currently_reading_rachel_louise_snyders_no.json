I&#39;m not an attorney and don&#39;t really want to go into what my work entails for privacy reasons, but I will say that this book is also relevant to me for my career. With that said, I don&#39;t think you have to necessarily work with victims of domestic abuse to benefit from reading this book (the rest of our book club works in finance, business, and academia).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not finished with the book yet, but I&#39;ve found it to be really thought-provoking. I&#39;ve tended to have a very narrow, limited perspective on domestic abuse, and this book is broadening things there. For example, I&#39;ve primarily thought of the direct victims of domestic abuse, but hadn&#39;t thought a great deal about secondary impact to those outside the family unit. I&#39;ve also found myself thinking a lot more about the perpetrators themselves, their upbringing, their current lives, and how they justified their crimes against others.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like this sub focuses a lot on fiction (and I love that too!) but I wanted to share about this book and see if anyone else had read it and if they had thoughts as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
