It's beautifully written, has great characters, and is just a great book so far, but dear lord it makes me feel dumb sometimes. I've lost count of how many paragraphs I've had to reread just to try and understand what's happening. Obviously anything worth while is going to be challenging, but I feel like I'm doing the book a disservice by not understanding everything about it. \n\nMaybe this book isn't tough for the average reader, but for me it's the most challenging book I've read. It's rewarding, but also disheartening... if that makes sense. I honestly feel like I'm missing a good amount of the story. Maybe I'll be more confident on a reread?\n\nLong story short... I'm loving the book, but having a tough time with it. Have any of you experienced these feelings about a book?",
