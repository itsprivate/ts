I have read a lot more books, watched more shows and anime and for the longest time it was absurd to me why Twilight was so popular and why I liked it so much, but now I have come up with this theory ( please bear with me)\nSo the main character, Bella doesn&#39;t have anything, like literally anything, she is an average student, she doesn&#39;t play sports, she doesn&#39;t come from a rich family and has zero social skills, the only thing we can say is probably she is beautiful but no.\nNo she isn&#39;t. She is described as an ordinary looking person, this illusion that she is beautiful comes from the fact that every other guy is falling at her feet for absolutely no reason because as I mentioned she, well, doesn&#39;t have any personality traits that might be attractive or special moments/ friendships with these guys or anyone for that matter, so she must be drop dead gorgeous..\nAnd from Edward&#39;s pov she is described as beautiful but let&#39;s ignore that, one other trait is that she is kind, but when?, when is the novel was she kind , she is always judging people in her head, is very selfish ( not in a evil way but still) and the only part where we can say that she may be a kind person is her consideration of her parents, but news flash all humans love their parents Edward, like is the bar for next mother Teresa really this low for you.\nThe girl in a walk to remember was kind, shoko in a silent voice was kind, sofie in howls moving castle was kind.</p>\n\n<p>With the description that is provided of bella from him and how others treat her you&#39;d think bella is someone really cool but in reality she is below average, just like every other teenager, just like I was in high school.\nAnd that&#39;s where this story draws it&#39;s fanbase from, bella despite having nothing to offer, despite doing nothing for other/herself or in general is having the time of her life with her billionaire hot vampire boo and his billionaire hot family and she has this love triangle situation that isn&#39;t complex like it&#39;d be in real life , it&#39;s just aesthetic, just how teenagers imagine, she is the special girl at school despite no social skills, it&#39;s all that unreal fantasy teenage world that almost every high schooler would be obsessed with, but when they grow up, twilight is a book they can never go back to.\nBut this story continues to be popular as new teens find it and on the cycle goes.\nWhat are your thoughts I&#39;d love to know.\nAlso this feels like something for subreddit venting but I really wanted to know your opinion, sorry&lt;3</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
