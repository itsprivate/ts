At all. I found it to be an exhausting slog with an awful POV character that didn&#39;t make any sense. Maybe that was because I <em>had</em> to read it for class rather than on my own. Maybe it&#39;s because my English teacher insisted on explicitly telling us what she wanted written on the exam instead of letting us come up with our own ideas. Maybe it was from an era that I couldn&#39;t relate to.</p>\n\n<p>In a completely unrelated conversation, a friend recommended <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower,</em>  and I think I got everything I was supposed to get from <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I could relate to the teenager trying to find his place in the world. I could sympathize with his loss and trauma. I actually cared about the main character.</p>\n\n<p>As someone approaching 30 years of age, the posts here on <a href=\"/r/books\">r/books</a> have inspired me to give <em>Catcher</em> another shot now that a decade has passed since I read it the first time. Maybe it will click this time, maybe it won&#39;t. But for a teenager in the 2010s who thought that <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> was hands-down the worst piece we had to read that year, <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> was what made me realize why <em>Catcher</em> was part of the curriculum.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
