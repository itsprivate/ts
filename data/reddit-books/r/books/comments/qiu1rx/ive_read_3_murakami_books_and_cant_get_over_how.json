I generally enjoy his writing style and I feel pulled in by his stories which has kept me coming back to his works. I just cannot get over how he writes women. They seem to solely exist as sex objects to satisfy this average male fantasy and it’s so cringey to read. It’s distractingly bad and I really can’t stand it anymore. I just finished Norwegian Wood and the whole thing with Reiko and the 13-year old was just way too detailed for my comfort level. I can tolerate sex in a book but Murakami definitely crosses a line in my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve heard good things about Kafka on the Shore and 1Q84, but I won’t read them if I know they’re going to be equally weird. So, I guess I’m asking if these books or any Murakami are worth it given my discomfort with Murakami’s portrayal of women? I keep praying it gets better with every book, but I’m getting increasingly disturbed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
