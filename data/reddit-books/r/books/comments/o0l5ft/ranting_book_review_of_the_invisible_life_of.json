What a good idea for a story! Which is why I'm so angry that the author did such a poor job. Everything from the writing to the plot to the characters was terrible. \n\n1. The writing - Interesting at first, but she's just not a good enough writer to pull off the style she was trying to write in. I think she was going for poetic and modern, but it came off as a college student trying to write in an interesting way and failing. You know those IG posts where the caption is full of \"deep\" descriptions, sentence fragments, and new paragraphs that are only a sentence long? That was this book. Oh, and she used the same description for every character over and over. Lucien is wolfish. Addie has freckles like a constellation. Every man in the book has curls falling over his forehead. FIND A DIFFERENT WAY OF DESCRIBING PEOPLE. Also, she kept hammering the same trope of, \"Addie didn't know about this yet, but she would.\" As in, \"Addie didn't know Italian yet, but she would,\" or, \"Addie didn't know about Luc's moods yet, but she would.\" This isn't interesting! This is not a story!\n\n2. The characters were super boring. Addie, the main character, was boring. Nothing interesting about her at all. Its a shame that a woman who turns immortal has no interests, imagination, or drive. Her mortal love interest was equally uninteresting. The two of them would walk around uninterestingly, apart and together. Its was very...uninteresting. \n\n3. Plot - there was no plot. Actually, I take that back. In a book that's 350 pages long, there was plot in maybe 40 pages. The beginning set up what should have been a really, really good story. Then nothing happened for 300 PAGES. The last 30 pages contained the rest of the plot. They were the most interesting by far, but still turned out to be boring because she hadn't developed relationships, people, plot, anything. I didn't care about anyone by then and forced myself to skim the last 30 pages, which is where everything actually happened. There was so much promise held in those 30 pages. Its such a freaking shame. You got a glimpse what this could have been had a talented storyteller written it. \n\nA good editor would have told her to take the first 20 and last 50 and write an entire new book just fleshing that out. Instead, you get 300 pages of Addie walking around and Luc appearing. They then have the same conversation over and over. Every time the timeline went to a moment in the past, you knew she was going to be walking around and that Luc would appear after a page and you knew exactly what they were going to talk about. This happened at least 25 times. No character development. No development in their relationship. No moving the plot forward. Just the same thing over. and over. and over. \n\nTL;DR - The writing, plot, and characters in this book were terrible, which is a shame for such a great premise. This story in a different author's hands would have been so, so great. I'm so mad a better author wasn't able to write it.",
