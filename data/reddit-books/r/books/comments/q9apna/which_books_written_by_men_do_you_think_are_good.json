So I want to know those that you’ve liked! I usually read feminine-centric stuff by women, but as a reader it’s hard to escape. I just started rereading “A Thousand Splendid Suns” by Khaled Hosseini, and I’m always astounded at his base understanding of the troubles of womanhood imo. This may be a bad example as it’s about the struggles of women under men, but it’s still beautifully written. I’d love some other opinions on this! Cheers</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
