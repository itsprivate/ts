Adams wrote one of my all-time favorite book series, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" and I was /invigorated/. I was halfway through the narrative before I researched the book and discovered that it was a sequel to \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.\" It was absolutely wonderful.\n\nInfusing mystery with fantasy (as opposed to Hitchhiker's which infuses an adventurous tone with sci-fi), the novel contains Adams' signature philosophical language and dry, British humor deriving from contemplations thereof. As engrossed as I can become in a novel, it's rare for an author to tickle my funnybone with words the way ole' Douglas does, by which I mean I've actually laughed out loudly upon reading a line or a character's gut-wrenching dialogue.\n\nOf course, if you've never read Adams, the book's peculiar nature and the unpredictable behavior of the character's and narrative's course can make the story hard to follow. Fret not, the narrative and descriptions are particularly vivid, however, mentions of a character's longstanding beef with an unseen character over who can go longest without opening a refrigerator door, or a character experiencing two car collisions in one chapter, or something even more perplexing involving a soda machine that's only briefly explained near the end, can perplex the mind as it may prepare itself for twists but not unpredictable, humorous shifts in tone and dialogue as the narrative bounces from location to location to character to strange character. Douglas Adams has a signature skill in tying the tightest knots regarding the most complex stories.\n\nCheck it out! I intend to read the first book as well as return to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series once a full set that I ordered arrives at my home.",
