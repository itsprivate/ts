I had heard Tolstoy's opus described as a slog,  with one friend stating that \"It's a fine book, so long as you don't mind endless pages describing a single stalk of wheat in the Russian peasant countryside.\" \n\nI was reminded of the common slander against Tolkien, that Lord of the Rings would be \"a better read if he didn't go on for a dozen pages about trees.\" I've never felt that criticism against Tolkien was valid, and though I do think some diversions are laboured, I never found him to be egregiously long-winded. It's the same with Tolstoy's War and Peace. \n\nThe Penguin classics paperback is 1,368 pages. Most chapters do not exceed 3 or 4 pages. Frequent chapter breaks, with four 'books' to each of the four volumes, keeps the sense of progression steady. There are regular time-jumps, there are plenty of characters to jump between to prevent a slog, and literally the only time I felt bored was during the Rostov's hunting party in Volume 2, which was overall a bit slower, being more Peace than War. But the novel is constantly propelling forward, the only other drag may be towards the end, but that is exemplified by a very literal drag in the drawn out events of late 1812, early 1813. \n\nVERY frequently I was shocked and even a little disappointed that Tolstoy would skip over some events so quickly, without detailing them. Everyone from large-scale events such as the aftermath of Austerlitz, to smaller scale events such as Pierre's induction into the freemasons. Long as the novel is, it never feels long-winded. \n\nPerhaps this is due in part to Anthony Briggs' translation, which was VERY easy and smooth to read, with beautiful but easy prose. Perhaps older translations DID feel like more of a slog, and I enjoyed War and Peace enough that I'd be interested in reading a different translation at a later date. \n\nAnyway, the point being: it was an incredible book, and far easier to read that I had expected for a book with a reputation for being, well, the War and Peace of fiction. \n\nLes Miserable next (the Norman Denny translation).",
