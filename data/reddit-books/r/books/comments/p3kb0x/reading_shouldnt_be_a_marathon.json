Recently I&#39;ve seen a surge in trends like &#39;100 books a year&#39; or &#39;10 books a months&#39; I don&#39;t know if it been this way since a long time or just recently but all I know is it&#39;s tiring. As a non native English speaker and a student it&#39;s difficult to keep up with the popular books/new releases. I know it may not be a big deal but, it may presurize some to read more without gasping the content in the book and may create reading stressful than fun.  If I try to gobble up 3 books at same time I don&#39;t remember a thing. I&#39;ve seen people read multiple books at same time to reach their reading goals. It&#39;s fine if you can do it. Some have difficult time reading one same book so I do get why many may want to read more. But honestly I feel like if I read a book/series one at a time it helps me absorbing the story more and realise situations (in the book) more accurately. I&#39;ve only once tried to read 2 books at the same time and ended up mixing the entire plot. And I don&#39;t have problem reading only one book at a time or one series at a time (maybe it&#39;s just me),if I find a book boring I DNF it immediately. I don&#39;t linger with it long and read multiple books. What&#39;s your opinion on this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
