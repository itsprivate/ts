The first time I saw Jurassic Park was on VHS.\n\nI have never read any of Michael Crichton's work, so I can't compare how Jurassic Park is to any of his other works. \n\nMy thoughts: I completely understand that a book and its movie are always different. This is more about: why did they make Hammond's character so much more likeable, friendly, and gave him \"sweet grandpa\" vibes in the movie? Why were *certain characters* kept alive during the movie? Why didn't we see more dinosaurs in the movie? \n\nAnd a praise for Michael Crichton: I just came from reading Jeff Vandermeer's Area X trilogy. Vandermeer has a way of slowing down reading with heavy diction and over explainations (not disparaging though, I do really like his work). I was expecting a science based novel like Jurassic Park to be the same way, but it was in fact a breath of fresh air. I so often caught myself 50 pages farther than I had anticipated reading. Crichton organized his chapters based on location or character. A chapter called 'Control' will show us paragraphs about each person in the Control room. A chapter called 'Tim' will only show us everything Tim is experiencing and feeling. This structure lets us as readers get a full perspective of what is going on. I could picture the entire park while reading. Crichton also doesn't patronize his readers. He includes scientific information through a character explaining, or one easy to read paragraph. There is no bore-ya-to-death textbook writing. \n\nI read 9 books last year, and unfortunately, due to life circumstances, this is the first one I've finished this year. I think this one will stay with me for a little while, as I prepare to read Lord of the Rings for the first time as well.",
