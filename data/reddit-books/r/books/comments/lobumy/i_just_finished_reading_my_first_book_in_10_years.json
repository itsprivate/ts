I struggle to ever just sit down and read a book for longer than 10 minutes before stopping.  I think the last book I read from start to finish was in High School and for a class... so this year I decided enough is enough.  I absolutely love the Witcher Video Game series and TV Show so I decided to give The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski a try.  I initially bought this book off Amazon July 13, 2015... Almost 6 years ago.  It was absolutely amazing from start to finish!  Not only was it an amazing book, but it's made me appreciate the Witcher series as a whole even more.  I'm going to be reading Blood of Elves next which I already picked up from Barnes and Noble recently.\n\nDespite this being my first book in 10 years, and I know it took me almost two months to read it, I hope to read at least 5 books this year as a minimum.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend The Last Wish if you're a fan of the Witcher games and show, it's absolutely incredible.\n\nEdit: Quick edit, but I also REALLY love the Expanse show on Amazon so I grabbed Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey as well :))  So I guess i've got a proper goal set out and some books lined up to read!",
