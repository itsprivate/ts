The way the author beautifully wrote this with an ending I already knew and managed to make it feel as if I experienced it for the first time amazed me. Madeline Miller created this story with a life like and personal feeling of happiness, friendship, love, sadness and fear that left me, admittingly, crying at the end. She framed the story of Patroclus and Achilles so beautifully, so passionately, and so real that this book will remain a part of me I think for quite a while. If I were to recommend ANY book to anyone, it would be this. So go, it waits for you.",
