It was absolutely amazing and has probably some of my favorite worldbuilding of any book I&#39;ve read. I finished the whole series in a week and since then I have been searching for anyone else who has read these books. No one I know has even heard of it and I&#39;m dying to talk about the books with someone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
