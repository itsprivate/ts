It&#39;s another one that has incredibly interesting material, but, while it&#39;s been in my library for more than 10 years, I haven&#39;t brought myself to read past the first couple &#39;laws,&#39; even though I&#39;ve very much enjoyed the time I&#39;ve spent with it.</p>\n\n<p>What is the book you can&#39;t seem to make it through? Any insight as to why? I&#39;m just curious. I know it&#39;s really just a matter of sitting down and doing it, and even though I read dozens of books all around it, it just seems impossible to read this one lol! Perhaps I need to just go back to reading comic books and Encyclopedia Brown novels :)</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day, everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
