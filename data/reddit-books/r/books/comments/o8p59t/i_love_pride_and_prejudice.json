Don’t know how many other guys love that book but I have no shame in saying that I love it. First off, Elizabeth Bennet is an incredibly awesome heroine and I have a hard time finding others who are like her. The characters are all well developed and some very humorous (looking at you Mr Collins). Personally (potwntial spoilers ahead) I find tremendous hilarity when a certain  someone make an attempt at a marriage proposal( a proprsal which should taught as an example of how &quot;not&quot; to make a proposal). The book also gives a great analysis or class/privalage and the sort during its era. I could go on for longer but I won&#39;t to waste any more of anyones time.  I&#39;d be happy to discuss more in PM&#39;s though</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
