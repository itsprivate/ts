It has gotten to the point where even bills are being drafted right now to &quot;deal&quot; with this issue. </p>\n\n<p>However, i feel there is something a lot of people miss which is a lot of these books that get removed or banned dont get rediscovered until years later.</p>\n\n<p>In college I took a journalism class and we had to write about how the media covered SC descisions. I did my report on this case which involved book banning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Trees_School_District_v._Pico\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Trees_School_District_v._Pico</a></p>\n\n<p>while doing research i was curious as to why these books were banned and I found some of them at my local library and I must say I loved them especially Down these Mean Streets, Go ask Alice, and A Hero Ain&#39;t Nothing But a Sandwich. Those three books actually talk about a lot of things young teens are still dealing with today and they give good insight as well.</p>\n\n<p>However, these books have gotten lost in time since they were printed because they were banned and I think thats the worst part of banning or censoring books which is a great and important book can get lost . Thats just my opinion at least.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
