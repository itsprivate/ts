It can simply mean that an author is very good at establishing and mainting tension. Sometimes such books heavily prioritise destination over journey and have weaker characters. The re-readability might also suffer.\n An example of the last book I read in a day was The Girl with all the gifts by MA Carey. While it had very interesting worldbuilding at the beginning it turned into a not that interesting road trip. I still finished it though because I hoped the scientists were gonna find a cure for the zombie apocalypse. Now that I know how the book ends I see no reason to read the book again. Dont get me wrong, the book wasnt bad, merely not great imo.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
