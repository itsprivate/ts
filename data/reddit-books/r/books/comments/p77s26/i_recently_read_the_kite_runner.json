Essentially, it tells the story about a young boy Amir, who lives in Kabul, Afghanistan. I decided to read it because the story seemed interesting and I also wanted to learn a bit about Afghanistan. I always seem to read the right books at the right time. A day after the taliban retook Afghanistan, I finished the book. I sobbed after reading it. It’s a powerful book, but it became even more powerful because of today’s current events. Please, please, read this book. My heart is with the people of Afghanistan.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
