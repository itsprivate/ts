What makes this book so &quot;bad&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: the general consensus seems to be that it&#39;s less that the book itself is flaming garbage and more that it&#39;s average/subpar but somehow managed to gain massive sales and popularity, hence the general disdain for it. I can agree with that sentiment and am thankful that I can rest easy knowing I&#39;m not a god-awful critic, haha. Three different people have recommended Foucault&#39;s Pendulum by Umberto Eco, so I&#39;ll check that out when I have the time. Thank you all for your contributions :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
