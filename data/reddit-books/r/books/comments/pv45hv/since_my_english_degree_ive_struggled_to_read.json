  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Fifteen years ago (!) I did an English Literature degree. I read copiously and habitually. I read prose, poetry, drama, Middle English, Ancient Greek and threw a bit of art history into the mix too.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I felt uneasy about the pressure of my course. I tried reaching out to friends at other universities, but they didn’t seem to understand. After all, I was studying English at Cambridge! This was (allegedly) <em>the</em> place to be an English student. Even US students came here. You had to be <em>brilliant</em> and you had to <em>love it</em> and you had to want <em>nothing else</em> than your own amazing career in publishing, academia, journalism…</p>\n\n<p>I wanted it, perhaps a little too much. My copious reading became something else. I would read and reread passages three, four, six times; would annotate and reannotate and try again and again to get what I wanted - which I couldn’t describe, but would “recognise when I see it”; study progressed into obsession and spiralled into exhaustion. I wanted to show I was up to the burden on my shoulders, and nothing I wrote was ever enough. I would either shut myself in my room and read or go for long meandering walks or longwinded chores just to avoid having to read again.</p>\n\n<p>I took a year off, hoping things could reset, but whilst I did eventually finish my degree (with an OK grade), I still found reading stressful. My first summer after university, I stopped reading and have barely tried since. That was eleven years ago.</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed <em>Pride And Prejudice</em> a few years ago but took several weeks to finish it. I had some good notes about exchange systems and zero sum language games but realised I was up to my old tricks. Then I picked up <em>Utopia</em> and wrote another essay about parentheses, digression and language rules. I tried <em>Gilgamesh</em> but found myself doing the same (Mesopotamian poetry has a compelling rhythmic quality, I will tell you that much).</p>\n\n<p>I’m wondering whether this is just the nature of things for me now or whether there’s a path to experiencing literature in a new way that doesn’t make the same demands of me emotionally (and in terms of sheer time). I miss the ability to experience the strangeness of other times and the pleasures of good prose. I want to write better myself and feel this needs a bedrock of good reading. But I don’t want reading a piece of literary fiction to become a Project.</p>\n\n<p>What I’d like is the advice of others who’ve been through the same and have found a way through to reading fiction again, even infrequently.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
