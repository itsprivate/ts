In the span of a few sentences, a nihilistic rant might ensue, some joker might get into a jam, the narrator(who either does, or does not exist) may divulge in a sardonic backstory for a character that shows up once, somebody might die, a love quadrangle will be established, a nefarious event may be ambiguously alluded to, somebody will have a mental breakdown, a villain will provide a logical point of view to his actions... it's unlike any author I've read before.\n\nThe Idiot was his funniest and strangest book.\n\nThe Possessed was his deepest and most tragic book.\n\nCrime and Punishment is his most focused and narrative story.\n\nAnd Brothers Karamazov is his well deserved magnum opus.\n\nHe doesn't just write books with a sole plot or theme, he is an author of humanity.\n\nI'm so grateful to have ever read his books :)",
