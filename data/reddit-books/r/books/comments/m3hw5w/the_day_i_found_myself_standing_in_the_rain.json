And boring too. I needed something to distract me. \n\nI decided to finally try an audiobook. I chose one called ‘Stormlight Archive’ by B.Sanderson, based on a recommendation I’d seen in r/books.\n\nHoly cow, this is perfect. I find myself getting lost in the book for 5 or 10 minutes at a time. Before I know it I’m halfway through my run already! \n\nListening to my audiobook becomes my special secret pleasure. The only time I let myself listen to it is when I’m running, as an incentive/reward. Over the next few months my runs grow from 20 minutes to 40, and even 60 minutes some days, just so I can spend more time listening to Kaladin and Shallan’s adventures.\n\nAfter 90+ hours of listening I’m nearly at the end of book two. That may not sound like a big number but it sure feels like I’ve done a lot of running in the last few months. I’ve lost 35 pounds.\n\nToday I was running along a high path by the ocean. It was a hot and humid tropical afternoon, but dark and cloudy with some light rain. The threat of a storm was in the air. Out at sea I could see shafts of light breaking through the clouds and spearing down into the grey-blue ocean beneath. \n\nI felt so light and filled with energy, like I was flying. Like I could run forever, and wanted to. I never imagined my body could feel like this. I glanced at my Garmin watch and saw I was running at 10.8km/h. I realised that’s exactly twice as fast as my first run a few months ago.\n\nAt this moment my book was building to a thrilling climax. Things seemed hopeless, then at the end of chapter 100 suddenly a hero miraculously appears... Those who’ve read it might remember this passage:\n\n‘You sent him to the sky to die, assassin,\" Kaladin said, Stormlight puffing from his lips, \"but the sky and the winds are mine. I claim them, as I now claim your life.’\n\nI was so caught up in the emotion of the moment I stopped running, and just stood there staring out at the tumbling steel sea, listening intently to every word. \n\nI realised tears were running down my cheeks. What the hell? I haven’t cried in....10 years? 20? And this is exciting! Not sad! What is wrong with me?\n\nI don’t know. But it felt good.\n\nI used to be angry and bitter and cynical a lot of the time. Certainly never ‘grateful’.\n\nBut now I often feel grateful. \n\nGrateful for being able to experience proper running before I get too old. For the pleasure of a good audiobook. For the beauty of the rugged empty coastline I call home. For many other things too.",
