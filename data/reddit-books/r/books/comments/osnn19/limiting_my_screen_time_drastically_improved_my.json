I’ve been an avid reader since I was a child but since I was 16 or 17 my reading just dramatically dropped off. </p>\n\n<p>Over the years I tried reading books that were recommended to me. I would often try to read at night before bedtime, I would always be able to get through a page or two before my eyes would start to glaze over and I would get sleepy. I even switched tact to reading in the afternoon but kind of the same thing happened. One problem was obviously I was being recommended more adult books and hadn’t read more than teenage level novels in many years.</p>\n\n<p>I started to limit my screen time on my phone about 6 months ago by putting limits and sticking to them. I slowly started to replace that screen time with other activities (not just reading). The effect after about a month of doing that was kind of magical. I don’t know if this is placebo effect but I started to make it through many more pages every day. And once I got caught up in a book I was able to look forward to reading it and it didn’t feel like a forced activity. </p>\n\n<p>For me it was a simple as just limiting my screen time and my attention span it whatever recovered enough to allow me to enjoy books again. I also feel much happier fulfilled and creative than I did before. I still use my phone and laptop plenty but reading again has brought a healthy balance back into my life. </p>\n\n<p>This may be kind of an obvious post but just wanted to share in case anyone else is having the same struggles with reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
