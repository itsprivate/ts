Thats why he can &quot;See the future,&quot; is because he truly believes he is still in that moment in WW2 as a PoW, and that everything that occurs to him afterward is just him seeing into the future.... His physical body continues through time, but his mind remains a PoW, and from time to time his mind can see into the future at what his body is up to. The Tralfamdorians, are just a red herring/plot device to help explain the separation of Billy&#39;s mind and body (I have other reasons for believing this. For example, Billy having a huge wang and having sex with the movie star in the zoo; that is just Billy himself looking at the picture of the donkey and the woman, where the zoo is always on display just like the subjects of the photo - it goes along with the theme of things actually being stuck in time).</p>\n\n<p>I think the novel is just a commentary about people with PTSD, and the way they are prisoners to their experiences, and how they can never truly escape their worst memories. They are locked into them mentally, just like Billy.</p>\n\n<p>The Tralfamadorians are purposely absurd, and they highlight the way those experiencing trauma will go to great lengths to &quot;invent&quot; something to protect themselves  and their psyche - which is what Billy did.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
