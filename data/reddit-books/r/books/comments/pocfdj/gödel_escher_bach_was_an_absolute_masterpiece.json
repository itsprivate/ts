The book is a bit dense and there’s parts that are a little math heavy but there’s so many concepts to explore all revolving around one theme. One of my favorite parts about this book is the characters in between each chapter used having a dialogue that explains what the next chapter will be about. If anyone has read this book I’d love to hear your opinion!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
