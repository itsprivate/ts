I’m slowly getting better now and am excited about the stuff I want to read, but I can only concentrate in the morning just after I’ve woken up because my mind hasn’t been exposed to all anything distracting yet. Any suggestions for how I can ignore all my concerns so I can focus on reading at other times of the day?<br/>\n I love reading so much. I study musicology and sometimes I really envy those in the same department at uni studying comparative literature. I often write about what I’m read on my blog and now it’s about a year ago, that I stopped in the middle of Shelley’s Frankenstein because my dad was dying (they only had one month left). The whole situation just made it impossible for me to read anything, especially when that <em>anything</em> was filled with death like Frankenstein was. After the death of my dad, my partner left me. At the same time, I was in the middle of a gender transition and I was suddenly very alone (also because the pandemic lockdown was a thing). Because of all those overwhelming things, my mind couldn’t read at all. Now it’s slowly getting better and a lot of the day, I feel very excited about all the stuff I <em>want to read</em> but I still have a hard time to focus. Only in the morning, before I’ve been exposed to any impression, is my mind calm enough to read. If I pick my phone and have a look at Facebook, my mind will think about the things I’ve seen in my feed, and I won’t be able to read for the rest of the day. I&#39;ve tried taking my bike out in the woods and sit there and read, but it doesn&#39;t help, my concerns are too overwhelming and sometimes they cause anxiety attacks.  </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any suggestion for how I can focus my mind and forget about my concerns so that I can read more during the day?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
