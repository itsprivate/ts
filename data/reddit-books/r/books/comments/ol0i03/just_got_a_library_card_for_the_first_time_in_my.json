But seriously having a library card as an adult is such a great feeling. </p>\n\n<p>I only just started to get into reading at age 25. I read as a kid but from middle school onward I just stopped. Convinced myself I “didn’t like to read”. I was smoking a lot of pot and watching TV and movies. But I recently quit smoking weed and have been using books to help me stay sober. It’s the best. A healthy way to escape and relax that still keeps my brain active. I’ve gotten really into fantasy and sci fi. I love humor so Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Kurt Vonnegut, Christopher Moore have been my go to guys lately. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like a kid again. Like I’ve just discovered a great joy in life that will always be there for me. I felt giddy walking around the library and picking out books. I feel silly for denying myself this joy for so much of my youth. But now I’m catching up.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just noticed my username checks out lol</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
