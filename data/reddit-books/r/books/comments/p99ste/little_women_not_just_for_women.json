I learned classics truly have no gender. I am a 38yo male and even if the target audience was a book about girls for girls (according to the introduction/preface), I was enraptured by the different personalities of the four sisters and I&#39;m sure anybody can find a little bit of them in their personalities. </p>\n\n<p>One of the things I liked most about the book was how each chapter was like a short story in itself--a little episode in the girl&#39;s lives as they grow up from young girls to womanhood. I have a terrible habit of day dreaming while reading or getting lost in fiction after a couple hundred pages, because I tend to be a linear thinker and of course fiction is non-linear, but I never lost track in this little gem.</p>\n\n<p>I liked the book so much that when a waitress at a local diner asked me about it and I told her how good it was. She said she might have to invest in it, so, I noted her name and the address of the restaurant on the receipt and sent her a copy through B&amp;N. I am now reading a chapter every night to my wife who is not a native English speaker and doesn&#39;t particularly like to read. It&#39;s even more enjoyable to read to someone else!</p>\n\n<p>Check this classic out--boys, girls, old or young. It&#39;s wonderful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
