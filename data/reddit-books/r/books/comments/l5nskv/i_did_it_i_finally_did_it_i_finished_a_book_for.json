Like a lot of people, in elementary/middle school, I could go through books like nobody's business but once high school came around, I quit reading cold turkey. Now I had accepted that I'll likely never get back to that point for several reasons like not having time, my ADHD and the squirrel sized attention span that it generously gifted me, and many others. \n\nFor years I've made attempt after attempt to read even just one book. Just one, single, tiny little book. I even chose books I knew I liked in the past or books I'd be very likely to enjoy like The Hobbit or Harry Potter and I just couldn't make it past *maybe* halfway? I think a big part of it was that I never got pictures in my head. For years I've told people my imagination is just dead and I have little to no ability to visualize things in my head. When I read The Hobbit, despite the pictures in my head I got reading it in the 8th grade or even the memories I had of seeing the films, I was blank in the head. Totally empty up there with nothing but blackness. \n\nFast forward to the past week. I had to go to a different store than the one I usually work at to fill in for someone who had some family issues crop up. This store is far less busy and much more laid back than my usual store so, on a whim, I thought I'd download a sample of something to help pass the time away. \n\nI've been playing The Long Dark for the first time ever this month and coincidentally had a trip to the mountains in NC last weekend as well. I think these subconsciously made me think of Hatchet for whatever reason and that's what I chose. I *BLEW* through the sample in like 10 minutes maybe and immediately impulse bought the whole book without even thinking about all the countless other books I paid for and never actually finished. This time, however, was different. In that same day I finished 63% of the book and probably could've gotten to at least 75% if I wanted to. I finished the book in like 6-8 hours read time.\n\nNow I know plenty of people can finish this book in an hour or two and that I admittedly read pretty dang slow, but I felt like I was flying through it! The short chapters felt so rewarding like I was really making progress! The story and language was easy to understand/follow and I never *once* reread a sentence! That NEVER happens! Just as quickly as I started reading it, I was finished. I just finished it an hour ago or so and I feel amazing! I feel like this could really be the start of getting back into it and I'm so happy!\n\n I just had to share this with you folks, I figured you'd appreciate it. I know there's probably lots of people in the same boat and it's really true what people say if you can just find the right book, it'll all click and be effortless!",
