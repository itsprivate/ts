I loved the cover and when I read the synopsis, I decided I was going to get it right when I read this sentence: &quot;On the outskirts, off the path through the woods, tucked between mountains, is a particular tea shop...&quot;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Not only did I pick it up but it moved to the top of my TBR. I realized I will automatically pick up any book that centers tea or tea shops and that I have other weirdly specific tropes/themes I love. For instance, I will pick up any book that centers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>main characters who are researchers, bonus points for English professors analyzing texts (I thought I would love A Discovery for Witches for this reason but it just didn&#39;t happen....)</li>\n<li>senior citizens dealing with age and growing older and they don&#39;t have a foil of a younger person &quot;reminding them of their youth&quot; apart of the journey, centers their story</li>\n<li>nerds becoming friends or falling in love- people who are really deeply into a specific fandom and find connection through it , bonus points for comic cons and nerdy events that come up throughout the book</li>\n<li>main characters dealing with the death of a romantic interest and processing it, I especially love when they travel or do some sort of project to work through their emotions</li>\n<li>the after life, but specifically after life that is some sort of heaven or other place; not located on Earth or in an in between spot</li>\n<li>characters who spend a lot of time alone reading or writing and have to be encouraged to leave the house</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of these things describe me as a person yet I love these tropes/themes! They just get me in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m curious: what are some of yours?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
