That’s actually the reason I picked up his books to begin with. I’m not an avid reader of fantasy by any means. I’m a big fan of Tolkien, GRRM, Robin Hobb, Neil Gaiman, Gene Wolfe and Joe Abercrombie but that’s mostly the extent of my experience with the genre. During the last year or so of the pandemic, I’ve been gravitating towards the fantasy genre a lot to get my mind off of the crazy shit going on in the world. Sanderson is a recommendation that came up numerous times, so I thought I would finally give him a shot.\n\n \n\nMy opinions on his work are based on what I gather are his two big trilogies – Mistborn and Stormlight. I read the initial Mistborn trilogy, the 3 Stormlight books and part of the 4th one. I feel like that is a lot of reading to do to form a pretty concrete opinion on an author.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m really underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were pretty high after seeing all the praise but I was let down most aspects of these books.\n\n \n\nFirst, the prose. It just seemed really wooden and bland, especially after having just read some Wolfe and Gaiman. I didn’t feel that Sanderson really improved in his prose at all over the course of the 6 books I read, and the style is just really bare-bones to move the plot along. YMMV I guess but it didn’t work for me.\n\n \n\nI wasn’t a huge fan of the characters either. They seemed a bit shallow and very….YA, for lack of a better word. It also seemed like Sanderson had like, a set list of character attributes for each character that he just repeated over and over. SHallan and Wit in particular, from Stormlight, are exceedingly obnoxious and badly written. The rest are just kind of bland. Again, they seem to be there as more of a vessel for the plots.\n\n \n\nTo add on from the above, I also found the dialogue to be really corny and downright cringeworthy at times. Anytime any kind of romance came into play, or really, any kind of interaction between a man and a woman, it was just really, really badly written.\n\n\nThe actual plots are just…ok. They have some neat twists here and there but for the most part, I didn’t think they were anything truly original. At the end of the day, they still come down to your typical young people with powers fighting against evil on the side of good. I really kind of found them to be mechanical and formulaic, just jumping from one set piece to another and culminating in a big finale. It’s really predictable after a while and you pretty much always know what’s coming. I never really felt like there was much going on beyond the surface-level narrative, no real thematic depth to speak of. There was an effort to explore mental health in Stormlight but honestly I felt like it was kind of poorly done. Again – very shallow and surface-level.\n\n\nAnother bone I have to pick is the magic systems. Again, this one is very YMMV as I’m not someone that really likes hard magic so that aspect kind of turned me off the books. There was just way too much time and word count spent on explaining the intricacies and mechanics of the magic. It got REALLY bad in Stormlight and honestly at times I felt like I was reading some kind of manual for a tabletop RPG. Like dude, it’s magic, just let us experience the wonder and mystery of it.\n\n\nThe overarching impression I got while reading Sanderson’s works, and the general popularity he has due to his stories and the number of books he puts out, is that he seems to be very much akin to the fantasy equivalent of summer blockbusters. Big, epic stories with some admittedly cool action scenes but ultimately following a formula and without much depth.\n\n\nAfter dropping Rhythm of War, I don’t think I will be going back to Brandon Sanderson again.",
