It ended up causing a huge fight and unfortunately led to the end of the friendship (although there were other factors, the book discussion was sort of the proverbial straw that broke the camels back). Now I&#39;m in a new book club that has been going really well for 7-8 months but the book for this month is just not connecting with me. Its so dry and boring that I can&#39;t stay focused on it for more than five or so pages.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what do you do when you just don&#39;t like a book that someone has picked for a book club? I don&#39;t want this to turn into a huge problem like it did with my old friends but I also can&#39;t find anything that I am enjoying about the book. I appreciate everyone&#39;s input.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
