This book is the fattest, juciest heartthrob I've ever read.\n\nDon't be afraid of reading Marcel Proust! He's only talking about shit we've all experienced before! I was intimidated with the purple prose at first but then it suddenly became endearing to me because I realized that what he's talking about is just mundane shit I've experienced day to day. The feverish struggle to go to sleep, yearning for a girl, good brioche, not being able to remember a piece of music, taking a sip of a drink to feel the first hit again etc. The intimacies of daily life! Emotions I have NEVER been able to put words as beautifully as Proust did.\n\nEven though he's \"In Search of Lost Time\", I'd argue he already FOUND that lost time, because the eye for beauty he gives you is an appreciation for the life you have. Words in a book to record that lost time. A gratefulness for the most mundane daily shit that EVERYBODY experiences. That the best parts of life is not in the big moments. It's in these small little places that Proust just perfectly and completely encapsulates. And it's quite a perfect read during a pandemic for this reason. You should give it a second chance if you've turned a page or two and got scared.\n\nI've never truly fell in love with a book until like now. I was actually scared to finish this book because I feel like I just don't want to let go of it. I only hope to inspire other people to read it as well just to be able to experience the expansive breadth of beauty it gives you. I'm fucking devastated actually like what am I going to be doing with myself for the time being I ordered part 2 but it's not gonna ship until March 9...",
