I put it in my backpack, so I would have it with me when I needed it. A few days later I had to wait for someone at the train station and went to peruse the books in a shop there. The only one book that really caught my eye was The Discomfort of Evening (het Ongemak van de Avond) by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld. It's the first time a Dutch author won the Booker Prize! The moment I read the discription I got the eary sence of deja vu. It is about a family who lose a child. The parents are so caught up with their own grieve, that they basically forget there are 2 more children that need them and that also need to grieve. My blood ran cold, because this is exactly my dad's story... He was the youngest of 3 when his sister of 16 died. It ripped their family apart from the inside out. 5 lives were distroyed by one death. It happened in the 70's when child psychology was not yet where it needed to be. My dad never got the chance to grieve propperly, cuz at 12 years old he became the peace maker at home who tried to keep everyone from falling apart and biting each others heads of basically.\n\nSo to get back to recent events; I try to pay for the book with my gift card and it doesn't work. The woman behind the counter tried 10+ times. It didn't work. She said the card might be to old, after 2 years they expire. My mind goed \"Uh-oh\", cuz it's about 2 years old, if not older. I ask her to try one more time, and to both our surprises it worked! And it had €15,- on it, the exact price of the book! I'm thinking this is fate. I put it in my backpack, super happy and get back to my meeting. The next day a friend of mine suddenly wanted to visit my home town. I said we could go there and stay the night at my dad's place. So we get there and I unpack my things, only to realise I just brought the perfect book for my bibliophile of a father of mine. I lend it to him, hoping he is not to aprehensive to confront his past. He used to hide from confrontation in any form. At this point he knows nothing about the book and the moment after we leave, he starts the book. Every day I check up on him an the phone and evey day he tells me about his past and how recognisable the story is to him. After 3 days he finished the book and tells me all about it and how much it means to him. He mentions I lend it to him and knowing what a sweet and shy guy he is, who doesn't want to step over someones boundaries, I know the question on his mind that he would never ask. I tell him the whole story how the book got to him and quip the universe wanted him to read this book and that it is his. He thanks me and the universe and tells me I can borrow and read it whenever I want. Ladies, gents and everyone else, I am proud of my dad!",
