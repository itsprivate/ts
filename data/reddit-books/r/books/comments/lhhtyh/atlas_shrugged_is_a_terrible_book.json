Atlas Shrugged is a **terrible** book. It reads like fanfic. Atlas Shrugged is like \"50 shades of gray\", but for the economy.\n\nIt's a long winded love letter to capitalism, with engineers and CEOs being by far the smartest, purest and best beings on our Earth, basically Disney princesses in suits, with doves landing  on their lapels and everything.\n\nBeing an inventor or a capitalist basically means you're the world champion of philosophy, limbo and sex.\n\nThis goes for women too! Well, A woman who's equal to them in every way, except when she gets horny and requires a good tending to, you know, like a silly woman does. But only by her intellectually and entrepreneurial equal, can't have some schmo with no patents to his name caress your snow-white complexion with his rough inventor hands, looking at you with steely blue eyes.\n\nThe grand finale is some guy reading out a manifesto on a radio or something to the entire Earth, everybody sits and listens in silence for hours because that's what 80 pages of it felt like.\n\nWhy is Atlas Shrugged so revered?",
