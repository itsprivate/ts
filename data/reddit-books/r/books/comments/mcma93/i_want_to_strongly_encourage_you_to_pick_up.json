Rampant Ayn-Rand-esque Capitalism\n2. Frequent themes of rape\n3. Generally uninventive prose\n4. *Incredibly* flat characters\n5. Plots lifted straight out of other, better books\n\nBut none of these alone (or in tandem) seems to capture the fullness of how much I want to dissuade people from reading this series.  Very rarely do I have experiences that make me contemplate my own mortality, but my only thought when I finally stopped reading these books was \"Wow...I will never get those hundreds of hours back\".  \n\nI've been a lifetime fan of Sci-fi and Fantasy, but these books almost turned me off the genre altogether.  For months afterward, I would think about some gruesome, inhumane, poorly written scene and just feel altogether slimy.  \n\nSince then, I've discovered Naomi Novik, Brandon Sanderson, and others who have shown me what *good* fantasy looks like and rekindled my love for magical worlds.  But the appreciation I have for them by comparison to Goodkind is not worth the effort of having read Goodkind in the first place.  \n\n\nPlease, pick up something else.",
