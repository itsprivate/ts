The society the book depicts is one with a totalitarian government like no other with oversight in every area of life, even one&#39;s own thoughts.  The brilliance of this novel is not necessarily the story or the setting but the questions it poses.  The book beautifully illuminates and questions reality many layers deep.  It questions the nature of individual freedom vs slavery.  The prevalence of individualism vs collectivism.  The existence of subjective reality and objective reality.</p>\n\n<p>This was by far one of the best books I have ever read and has changed my fundemental view of self and reality.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who thinks deeply about the universe and the nature of existence and wishes to understand themselves and the world around them better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
