Her writing is so beautiful and expressive, and I&#39;m short of words to explain how I loved the little metaphors spread across the book. </p>\n\n<p>The world of Estha and Rahel is so beautifully woven Also, why this book hits home, is because of the reality of significant issues it raises, like the caste system and domestic violence or the inherent patriarchy in families. These things are not fiction, they occur in this very world. Uh, I was very heartbroken in scene &gt;! where police officers were hitting Velutha !&lt;.</p>\n\n<p>So a few questions/ discussions in my mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What did you guys feel about the ending on Estha and Rahel? It somehow felt alright in the book (<em>made sense somehow?</em>), though in the real world, &gt;! incest!&lt; is something maybe we aren&#39;t comfortable with. </li>\n<li>What did you guys take from this book (in a positive tone)?</li>\n<li>Also, is it the kind of book you would mention in your interview while talking of hobbies (reading, that is)? Why/ Why not?</li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t understand the larger political reflections of the book. If anybody can shed some light on that, it would be great!</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
