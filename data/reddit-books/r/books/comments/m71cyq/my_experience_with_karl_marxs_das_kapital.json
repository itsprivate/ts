After all, the science of economics was able to graph happiness and establish the “Law of Diminishing Return” which I considered to be deeply philosophical topics.

So, I pick up Karl Marx’s “Das Kapital.” And, just like with my macroeconomics class, I am pleasantly surprised with how much insight the book brings into how the world operates. Specifically, the book focuses on accumulation of wealth via exploitation of labor and presents the capitalist exploitation of labor as a machine of perpetual motion. In other words, “Das Kapital” present capitalism as a system that is able to expand indefinitely with its limitless ways of exploiting labor. Due to its effort to be insightful, however, “Das Kapital” is chaotically structured: philosophical insights intertwined with algebra/algebraic formulas and historical observations. As a result, such chaotic structure causes the book to lack in clarity. This shortcoming, however, should not deter anyone from reading “Das Kapital” due to its ability to critique a system that is dependent on complacency.",
