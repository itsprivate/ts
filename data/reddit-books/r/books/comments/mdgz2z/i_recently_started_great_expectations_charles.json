I moved pretty far from home a couple months ago and brought a box of books with me - mostly favorites but also a few I've owned for a while but never read, thinking I'd make the effort to finally read them. One of those was Great Expectations. I was talking to my sister on the phone a couple weeks ago and she saw a quote posted on FB that made her think of something I'd said, so she shared it with me. And guess where it was from? Great Expectations! So I took that as a sign that I needed to start it.\n\n\nHere's the quote, which is the last paragraph of chapter 9:\n\n\n“That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.”\n\n\nThis really hit me - like it made me very emotional very suddenly and the tears started flowing, and it took me a minute to regain my composure. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before so it felt really strange. Several months ago I met somebody while traveling who sort of changed my perspective on things, and if I hadn't met them I don't think I would have had the courage to make the move I did and wouldn't be where I am currently. It was such a chance encounter that sparked this whole wave of changes and reading that quote just made me think if that day hadn't happened how different my life could be.\n\n\nDoes this strike a chord with anybody else?",
