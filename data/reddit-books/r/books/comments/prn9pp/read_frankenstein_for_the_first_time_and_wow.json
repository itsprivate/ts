Utilising this post as the first materialisation of a mass broadcast of this act of mine, I say one thing - ‘to hell with popular culture, fellow human. this is not a horror book as we have been made to believe. nope. this is science fiction with a strong revenge story and reflection on human loneliness and wretchedness in as fluid and beautiful a language as possible. calling it a horror story is akin to calling interstellar a comedy.’ </p>\n\n<p>And by the way, the more I read Classics which have stood the test of time filter, the more I realise how bad and pretentious many of the current writers are. This book was written by a girl in her late teens more than 200 years ago - I am in sheer awe of her control over language (her words are like honey-drops, measured and never wasted or futile), layered narration (at one point, there is a story in a story in a story in a story in the story), philosophical maturity, and a near-perfect masculine portrayal. What a brilliant, brilliant experience reading this one was!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
