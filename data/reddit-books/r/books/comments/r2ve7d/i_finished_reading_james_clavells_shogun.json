It might just be the best story ever told. Never before has a book gripped me this much. It contains all these devious, entertaining, bloodthirsty and incomprehensible and unpredictable characters who drive the conspiracy and blood laced plot that&#39;s over too soon, despite being a full 1150 pages long and covering over a year. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The only problem I had was that the book doesn&#39;t really have a climax. It has mini climaxes and scenes of hair raising tension but no ultimate climax. The resolution is in one page and the final chapter is just a monologue of things <em>that could happen</em>.Considering the book is already this long,</span> it&#39;s understandable but I wish Clavell wrote a direct sequel, for the book is a great example of how incredible storytelling can overcome the lack of beautiful prose and a lot of plot and how for a novel to be entertaining, the art of storytelling is the key. The japanese short story writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa had a literary feud in the early 1920s with his contemporary Junichiro Tanizaki over whether story was more important than the way the story was told. Akutagawa held the latter position and I think he was right, after reading this book.10/10 from me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
