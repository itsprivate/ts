I don&#39;t mind starting a series before its finished to support the author but at this point it basically seems he&#39;s never going to finish it.</p>\n\n<p>However, a bunch of my friends kept telling me it was worth to read even if he doesn&#39;t finish. They said it was in their top 5 fantasy books so I finally caved in and read the first book.  Overall, I really wasn&#39;t impressed.</p>\n\n<p>My biggest gripes were:\n1)  Having Kovthe tell the story. It kinda breaks any suspense of what will happen to him if we already know he&#39;ll turn out basically fine.</p>\n\n<p>2)  The prose itself was pretty good, he definitely has a way with words. But sometimes it almost felt arrogant, like he was trying to show off by his writing\n It took me out of the story sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>3) Probably my biggest problem, Kovthe is just ridiculous. He is like the epitome of &quot;....and then the entire room stood up and clapped for me&quot;. Like that literally happens lol.  He is just the best at everything; youngest wizard ever, all the girls love him, super intelligent, greatest musician, literally talks about how he knows how to size up a horse and a town.  Its so stupid. There are no real challenges in his life. He talks about how &quot;if this were a made up story things would have just worked out great, but they didnt&quot; yet two chapters later he&#39;s figured everything out and everyone clapped.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I could go on, but I&#39;ll stop fow now.  I&#39;ll probably read the second book just to shut my friends up, but overall, definitely not my favorite.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
