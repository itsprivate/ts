There was no way of stopping me from reading anything I could find on my mom&#39;s bookshelf. But adult life has gotten the better of me; I have to study a lot to keep up with office work, and I just didn&#39;t have the energy to read.</p>\n\n<p>But as of late, I have re-kindled the momentum of reading books that I like and find quite enjoyable, both fiction as well as technical stuff!</p>\n\n<p>Granted, there are 2x100 page books/short stories in there, which feels like cheating. But I don&#39;t mind, as long as you don&#39;t! I&#39;ve overcome the laziness and I&#39;ve been back at reading for a while. And I&#39;m proud!</p>\n\n<p>It all started because I wanted to finish the Dante and Colombia series by Sandrone Dazieri, so I re-read the second book in order to get into the third. And I just couldn&#39;t stop. The first book is called Kill the Father, if anyone is interested.</p>\n\n<p>I also threw a few science books in there that I knew I&#39;d love, for good measure (had them collecting dust on my shelves):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kill the Angel (Dante and Colombia #2), Sandrone Dazieri.</li>\n<li>Kill the King (Dante and Colombia #3), Sandrone Dazieri.</li>\n<li>Lord of the Flies, William Golding. Re-read. One of my absolute favourites.</li>\n<li>Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck. Read it in one sitting on a 3h plane. I adored it so much!</li>\n<li>A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking. Physics book #1.</li>\n<li>Atom, Lawrence Krauss. Physics book #2. I had to take notes reading this to keep track of a few things. But I enjoyed myself enormously.</li>\n<li>The Theory of Everything, Stephen Hawking. Physics book #3. To my dismay, I realized upon reading that the conference&#39;s this book is based on, are 95% copied from A Brief History of Time. Since it&#39;s another 100 page read (just like Of Mice and Men), I read it anyways while sitting at a cozy bar.</li>\n<li>The Orange Clockwork, Anthony Burguess. I have to admit, that I didn&#39;t know that this book was written in a certain type of lingo the author came up with, the Nadsat speak, if I recall correctly, which I wasn&#39;t prepared for at all. At the start it was very hard to understand, but luckily, the words were very repetitive and it seemed to me that the vocabulary was rather slim, and therefore, it felt easy to remember after a few pages. But I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much as I wanted.</li>\n<li>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams. I laughed out loud like a maniac while reading this; and I&#39;m going to get the #2, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, tomorrow! I adored reading this so much, I want them all! </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can easily see that I&#39;m playing catch up with my years of having lost interest and practice in reading. There are so many books that I have left behind, and so many things to read from now, that it makes me feel giddy.</p>\n\n<p>What am I planning on reading now? I have a few things that I had waiting for me on my shelves, that I just didn&#39;t get around to reading. I&#39;m probably going to read the Harry Potter play first, because it&#39;s easily to digest (I wouldn&#39;t want to loose the momentum!), and I can see The Restaurant at the End of the Universe on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>A longer read that is waiting for me on my shelves is 11/22/63 by Stephen King!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I feel proud of myself, and I want to keep the momentum going. I know work will be in the way of reading, but I successfully avoided sitting at the computer for a few weeks now, and I feel so comfortable reading with a coffee in hand, that I feel like I could do this forever.</p>\n\n<p>What have you guys been reading of lately? Do you lose or gain interest in books easily? If you&#39;ve ever lost interest in books as an adult, what has brought you back?</p>\n\n<p>I wish you all a wonderful weekend!!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: wording.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
