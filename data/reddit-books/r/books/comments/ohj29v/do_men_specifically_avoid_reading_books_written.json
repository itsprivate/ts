  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Guardian had an article about how of the top 10 female literary authors, their readership is 81% women. I had never considered this before, truthfully. I (female) read books of all types, I don&#39;t even notice whether a man or woman writes them. Sometimes I wouldn&#39;t even know based on the name. The article makes it sound as if men specifically avoid female writers but does this have anything to do with the topic, perhaps?  Statistically, women read male and female authors about equally while for male readers it skews heavily the other way, and this includes fiction and non-fiction. It suggests an appearance that if a guy knows a book is written by a female, they are more likely to avoid it. </p>\n\n<p>For the guys out there, what do you think of this idea? Do you avoid books written by women, including classics by literary greats likes Jane Austen and Margaret Atwood? Consciously or unconsciously? Is it something you consider or think about? Why or why not? </p>\n\n<p>Here is the article for reference: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/09/why-do-so-few-men-read-books-by-women\">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/09/why-do-so-few-men-read-books-by-women</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
