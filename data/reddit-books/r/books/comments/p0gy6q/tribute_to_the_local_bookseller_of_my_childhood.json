I&#39;m not a Luddite, but I do have a soft spot for a place where you can come in browse for hours.Maybe even sit and read. Enough preamble; here&#39;s my favorite.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 12 or 13, around 1995 or 1996, a new book store opened up in my town. There already was one bookseller, an independent shop that dealt only in new titles. Susan&#39;s Books was different. She carried all sorts of books. Her model worked in a way that was novel to me. </p>\n\n<p>All books were on sale for half the cover price, unless they were really in bad shape. But the real deal was that she would take your books in as inventory, and give you store credit for a quarter of the cover price. My family were all voracious readers, so when the shop opened we brought in dozens of titles. I think we ended up with something like $1000 in store credit. And most of that was from books that we&#39;d gotten cheap at garage sales. Susan only charge you a quarter for each credit transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Once you were done with the book, if you didn&#39;t feel like keeping it, you could just bring it back to her for more credit. Her shop was open for about 5 or 6 years before she sold her inventory to Powell&#39;s and retired. That initial burst of credit kept us in books for the entire time. From Susan I got into Ian Fleming, Frank Herbert, Philip K Dick and so many others. I read enough books that I&#39;ve forgotten most of them, to be honest.</p>\n\n<p>Susan&#39;s shop felt like a second home. I&#39;d walk or bike a few miles every day in the summer to just spend an hour or two browsing shelves and then buy a few books. Sometimes I&#39;d stay and read in her sitting section. Other times we&#39;d just chat. </p>\n\n<p>Susan only ever had one employee at a time. For a long time it was a high school girls named Kelly (I think). I thought she was so cute and smart that I would awkwardly chat her up for hours at a time. Kelly, if you ever read this, I&#39;m the weird autistic kid who wouldn&#39;t stop talking. Sorry about that.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I really valued that store. It was so great to be able to just look for a book, not knowing what you wanted and find something that felt like it was destined to be yours.</p>\n\n<p>After Susan retired another shop opened up in town, and it used the same model. It was a bit bigger, and the women who ran it were nice. I had like $150 in credit when I moved away so I just transferred it to my friends (who ended up becoming my in-laws a few years later).</p>\n\n<p>All of the stores in that town are closed now. I still have Powell&#39;s nearby, or Cameron&#39;s if I want something more independent (though I can&#39;t stand how Cameron&#39;s stacks their shelves). But I&#39;ll always miss Susan and her little shop.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
