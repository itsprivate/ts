Truly a beautiful book, one of the few books to make me feel, see and even hear everything within the book. It feels like the journey Dante undertakes is one that the reader takes himself. The entire book is wonderful and picturesque. You can feel the scale of the world around them, feel the awe, the fear, the wondering as they enter new areas and encounter the various figures of the ancient world. </p>\n\n<p>It’s remarkable books that predate the English language still have an elegance about them 700 years later. I wonder if mediums such as movies and TV will have such longevity in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, done with that book, probably a 10/10. Not sure which I’ll move onto next. Sorry if no one cares about this post just had to share my thoughts on it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
