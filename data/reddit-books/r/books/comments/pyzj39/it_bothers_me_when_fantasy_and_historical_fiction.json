In many scenarios, you would be lucky to make it 20 miles a day (probably less if you have to stop to hunt and gather for food, Oregon Trail-style).  It takes me right out of the narrative every time I encounter something like a leisurely three day stroll to a city implied to be a couple hundred miles away, or an army of thousands fighting their way across an entire continent in a couple of weeks. Not to mention the logistics of making sure their is enough food and water for everyone, or the time and effort it takes to look after horses. I get that no one wants to read pages of details about how the characters get from one significant plot location to the next, but it is a huge failure of research when authors get the basic details wrong, especially in historical settings where it is easy to figure out 1) how far apart two places are and 2) how long a trip like that would have taken for the time period.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
