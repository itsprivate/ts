I’m not gonna lie, I cried at the end, just because the storytelling is so powerful at explaining the grief, guilt and sadness that Patroclus has, and the pain that Achilles goes through.  It so damn good.  My experience was enhanced by listening to “Achilles, Come Down” by Gang of Youths, which made the emotional scenes just so much more impactful and tear-jerking.  It really shows the internal struggles that Patroclus goes through near the ending of the story, culminating in the bittersweet ending of Patroclus pouring his heart out, reminiscing on his own memories of Achilles to Thetis, which shows the love and bond that the two had.  God, this was an incredible book and I wish I could read it again for the first time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
