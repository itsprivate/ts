I rarely read YA, I&#39;ve read about 5 of these and enjoyed maybe 2. But even the other ones just keep looking really enticing to me.</p>\n\n<p>Like yeah, there is obviously a trend going on with them bordering on the cliché:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The big central overdesigned title font</li>\n<li>Surrounded by some sort of escutcheon, or a portrait-framing pattern</li>\n<li>CGI-looking object effects</li>\n<li>The title itself, that often sounds like half a sentence, or a powerful exclamation</li>\n<li>The vibrant, popping colors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then again, this is sort of inevitable when different artists are trying to signify what genre a book belongs to, and what the reader should expect.</p>\n\n<p>Romance novels used to have their photos of random hunks, nowadays they have their soft-pink backgrounds with minimalistic drawings that look almost like Corporate Memphis.</p>\n\n<p>Adult fantasy novels used to have their elves in chainmail bikinis posing in front of dragons, nowadays they mostly just have hilts of swords.</p>\n\n<p>Even literary fiction has <a href=\"https://www.printmag.com/book-covers/the-book-cover-behold-the-book-blob/\">recently received criticism</a> for their almost interchargible blobs of colors.</p>\n\n<p>However, these YA fantasy ones aren&#39;t actually interchargible. I mean, they do have very distinct aesthetics from each other, while forming a pattern.</p>\n\n<p>And they feel a lot higher quality, than a character portrait or a landscape painted with the same amount of effort probably would.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever i see ones like this at a bookstore, or just these pictures themselves at a web store, I immediately think that these feel high production value, and even if they are not really for me, they seem really greatly designed to reach out to a 15 year old girl who is in the mood for some BLOOD AND BONES! and WE SHALL BURN DOWN THIS WHOLE MOTHERFUCKER! and ARGH! FUCK UP THE STARS! SLAY THE GODS THEMSELVES!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
