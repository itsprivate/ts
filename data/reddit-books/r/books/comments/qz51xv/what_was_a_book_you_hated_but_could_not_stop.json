I can be an incredibly picky reader and if I don&#39;t like something as vague as the writing style of the author I will entirely forego reading a particular book even if it has an incredible plot. </p>\n\n<p>For mine, it was Sidney Sheldon&#39;s <em>The Stars Shine Down</em>. I read the book my sophomore year of high school after grabbing it semi-randomly off of Mom&#39;s bookshelf. The main plot follows a Nova Scotian girl who becomes a real estate developer first in Canada then in the US at a similar success level of Donald Trump. It skips over years at a time to show her rise to power. The ending&gt;! has one of her only close friends and investors being discovered as the guy who killed her boyfriends of the past that were sparsely noted. !&lt;</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the whole novel though, I continually asked myself, &quot;why the hell am I reading this?&quot; The MC was extremely naïve at her most intelligent and unrealistically stupid at her worst. From her not noticing the love that one of her friends had for her, to her belief in her projects with an optimism that borders on a form of pollyanna. It failed to really explain any story except for how successful the MC was and supporting characters really blended together. The revelations at the ending came out of left field with so little context I hadn&#39;t noticed it until then. Sheldon seemed to focus on unimportant details throughout the novel while important ones faded away without attention.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what it was about this book, but I could not stop reading. Every opportunity I had I pulled out the book and just kept reading.  I was able to finish it within a couple of days at a time where I would generally take a week or so to read similarly sized books. Part of me wants to say that it was impressive that I had never expected the ending because of incredible writing skills employed by Sheldon. In actuality, however, I just cant help but think this was a terrible book that I drove myself to complete regardless of my thoughts on it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
