But recently, I've noticed more and more how people let other's opinions influence and even dictate what they choose to do and not to do. I've noticed in some friends of mine that they will turn away from their interests because the herd of people that have spoken out about the topic were negative.\n\nPersonally, while the logic is sound in the sense that they will save themselves time, but I'd question to ask where this saved time is being spent if not on your interests.\n\nLast night I decided to read \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho. I've seen several posts here and there about it being amazing, terrible, underwhelming, or whatnot. After reading it, I don't feel an overwhelming sense of self realization by any means, but I wouldn't go as far as talking ill of the book. It can serve to help people experience the \"hero's journey\" which is the core of many stories out there. It's not terribly dense or difficult to unpack, but I wouldn't devalue the book by any means. I've spent years wanting to read this book because of the hype, but last night I finally did because I saw posts talking less of it.\n\nI enjoyed it. It's akin to The Little Prince. A very straightforward story that can be appreciated by all to some degree. At the least, it will open a door to allow a person to look more introspectively on their lives and to connect with themselves and their virtues. To put such a lesson in an easily digestible book is nothing short of valuable.\n\nSo all in all, think for yourselves whether to pick up a book or not. Take the opinions of others always with a grain of salt(even mine for that matter), because your experience will not be theirs. Follow your bliss, and trust in the path you want to take.",
