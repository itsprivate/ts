There&#39;s this book I want its a Swedish horror novel and every single copy I can find the cover is a still from the movie adaption. I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don&#39;t want a film poster on it. I almost don&#39;t even want to get the book. I&#39;ve seen this trend happen with a lot books that turned into movies and frankly I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s a movie. I&#39;m here for the book! I don&#39;t want to see the movie cover I want to see the original book cover. I love how unique book cover art can be and I feel like slapping the movie poster on every new copy does the book a slight disservice. I know im sounding like a cover snob and  I know there&#39;s more to books than the book cover but I cant help but being annoyed when it&#39;s all I can find for new copies.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: on a happier note here&#39;s some of my favorite book covers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/E7wg3kM\">http://imgur.com/a/E7wg3kM</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit edit: I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize this was such an overused topic on the sub. I have only been a member on this sub for a few months so I didn&#39;t know. Was just a little rant and don&#39;t have any reader friends irl to share it with so I came here instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
