But I absolutely adored Plath’s writing, her descriptions of New York in the 1950s, and the way I felt as if I were Esther herself. I look forward to reading books similar to this style in the future, but for now I’m moving on to more lighthearted reads. But, if you have not read The Bell Jar yet, please do so. Note: please read the book after you look up trigger warnings and are comfortable with reading about them. Overall, incredible book.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
