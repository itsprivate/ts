I reckon they've got enough money to be going on with, so am looking for good alternative places to buy and learn about books/book related services from. If anyone has any tips then I'd be happy to hear them! \n\nNot including local libraries, whose services will differ regionally under COVID, here some things I've found:\n\n[https://www.hive.co.uk/](https://www.hive.co.uk/)\n\nHive is a UK online bookseller that donates percentages of its sales to independent bookstores. You can nominate you local bookstore to get your donation from and also collect your book from that store in person (in which case their percentage of sale more than doubles).\n\n[https://libro.fm/](https://libro.fm/)\n\nI've not tried this yet, but it looks to be a similar concept to Hive but as a subscription Audiobook service, with a percentage going to independent bookstores. I've not yet given it a go, so can't speak to their selection, but prices look very similar to Audible and with the same 1 credit per month system in place.\n\n[https://app.thestorygraph.com/](https://app.thestorygraph.com/)\n\nI've thought that Goodreads is a bit of a mess for a while. The recommendations are odd, big new releases can be weirdly hard to find, it generally has an unintuitive web 2.0 vibe with lots of functions that break regularly. So I was pretty happy to discover this. It's a very similar \"Facebook for books\" concept but with a much better layout and recommendations system. It categorises books not just by genre but by things like mood, pace, and characterisation. Then it searches for books based on what books you like generally and what you're in the mood for right now. You can import your Goodreads history into it so it can use all that data.\n\n[https://bookmarks.reviews/](https://bookmarks.reviews/)\n\nI was also using Goodreads and Amazon to find book reviews and both are pretty notoriously poor. Easy to \"game\" by paying for good reviews and there's always the organic issue that people will naturally gravitate towards books they already think they'll like, which artificially inflates their scores, while reading \"classics\" with a sense of grudging obligation, which deflates theirs. This site is a reviews aggregator, similar to rottentomatoes, which will give you a good overview of what the reviews are saying generally.\n\nIf anyone has any other recommendations I'd love to hear them, trying to go Amazon-free in 2021!",
