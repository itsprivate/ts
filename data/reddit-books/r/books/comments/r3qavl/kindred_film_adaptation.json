I know adapting books to films is hard enough, and with this one especially, you&#39;d really need the right team of people. But it was first published in the 70&#39;s, and it&#39;s still such a timely story. So why no adaptation? Does Octavia E. Butler&#39;s estate not want that, that&#39;s the only reason I can think of. I&#39;m positive that in the right hands, this could make for an excellent film, or even a miniseries.</p>\n\n<p>What do you all think? Do you want to see this book on the big/small screen?  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;m looking more into it, and I see that as of March 2021, a pilot has been ordered by FX. So if all goes well, looks like this will be happening after all. 🙂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
