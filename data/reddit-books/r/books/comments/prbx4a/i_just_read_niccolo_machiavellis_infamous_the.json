At under a hundred pages, I hadn&#39;t realised how short a book it was. So thought I&#39;d finally edify myself on what &#39;machiavellianism&#39; was actually all about.</p>\n\n<p>I did a naughty thing and ordered a big slice of cake and read the whole thing in one sitting, in the bookshop (my conscience got the better of me though and I did buy the copy in the end!)</p>\n\n<p>Its short chapter layout, and the English translation I had, made for a suprisingly easy read, especially for books of this time period (15th century).</p>\n\n<p>After a brief, and extremely sycophantic, accompanying letter. One that Machiavelli had penned to Lorenzo de&#39; Medici, the then incumbent ruler of Florence, Italy, he delves into his philosophies on how an effective ruler should govern.</p>\n\n<p>It packed a punch right from the off. Remarking in an early chapter &quot;in general, you must pamper people, or destroy them&quot;. &quot;Harm them just a little and they&#39;ll hit back&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>He starts as he means to continue. With an unflinching, but well supported case for the most effective way to govern. Some further reading showed me that in context, Florence had had a turbulent few decades, with a succession of leaders and depositions. So it&#39;s understandable that a new ruler would be open to entertaining ideas that would be... For lack of a better word.... Distasteful.</p>\n\n<p>Machiavelli goes on to list the different forms of leadership and monarchies, and the different possible &#39;leadership styles&#39; available. Citing a myriad of historic examples to back up each claim he makes. From the - at the time - current King of France, to the Romans and Alexander the Great.</p>\n\n<p>He spins a compelling case for pragmatism, over morality or virtue. In perhaps his most controversial chapter &quot;cruelty and compassion, whether it&#39;s better to be loved or feared&quot;. He boldly asserts that &quot;gratitude is forgotten the moment it is inconvenient. Fear means fear of punishment, and that&#39;s something people never forget&quot;. Subliminally (though not so subtly) riling against the prevailing Christian zeitgeist of kindness and compassion. Machievelli concludes &quot;a sensible man will base his power on what he controls, not on what others have the freedom to choose&quot;. Ultimately favouring cruelty over compassion. </p>\n\n<p>But there is an important nuance here that is often overlooked when pseudo intellectuals like me throw around the term &quot;Machiavellianism&quot; in an effort to sound clever. Machiavelli insists that cruelty must be both proportional and surgically precise in its execution. Emphasizing the importance of &quot;avoiding contempt and hatred&quot;. His uncomfortable advice is for a ruler to &quot;keep his hands off his subjects property and women&quot;.  Claiming &quot;a man will sooner forget the death of his father than the loss of his inheritance&quot;. A point for debate at the very least.</p>\n\n<p>It is also important that Machiavelli clearly states that this quick and decisive &#39;cruelty&#39;, exacted on a few individuals to quash dissent, is to prevent finding oneself in an endless cycle of violence. By leaving conspiracies and sedition unchecked this can (he argues) ultimately lead to more bloodshed. This is not cruelty for cruelty&#39;s sake. This is an extreme form of ultilitarianism. Designed to minimise violence in the long run, by inspiring fear and order in the short term. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it&#39;s definitely worth a read. Especially as it&#39;s a seminal book you can finish in just a few hours. I wouldn&#39;t advise calibrating your moral compass on it. But there are useful nuggets of information, still as relevant today as they were then. Especially when facing the day to day issues of office politics, and social drama. Sometimes the harsh reality is that cold hard pragmatism not only trumps generosity, but can in fact be morally justified in the long run.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
