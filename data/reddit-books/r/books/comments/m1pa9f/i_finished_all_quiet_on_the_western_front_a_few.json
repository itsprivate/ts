He barely spoke French and couldn’t communicate with this girl. He barely knew her, but it was the only time he described live in the book. He barely felt that way when he went home because home wasn’t real for him anymore. The only thing real to him was death. You know with how it was written, Remarque experienced something very similarly as a 19 year old just wanted to experience a normal life and young love; not stuck in the trenches brutally killing other humans and watching his friends die 1 by 1.",
