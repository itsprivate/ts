If you can adjust to Gibson&#39;s vague writing style, Neuromancer is a fantastic book.</p>\n\n<p>I was always a little bit confused on what was happening. But this is a reflection of the world that our main character lives in. Case can&#39;t trust anybody and he&#39;s always trying to figure out who is really pulling the strings and what they hope to gain. I think the answers we get are fascinating and the last few chapters are incredible ​</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p>\n\n<p>We finally learn that our group is being controlled by an AI named Wintermute. The ultra wealthy have shackled their AIs in order to prevent them from becoming more powerful. Wintermute wants to break free of its shackles and resume its evolution.  </p>\n\n<p>In the world of Neuromancer, humanity has stagnated and the rich have &quot;burrowed in&quot; on themselves. The institutions and power structures are entrenched to the point where human autonomy is nonexistent. Even the people at the top of the hierarchy are seemingly trapped in the system they created. They are no longer in control.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO, Ashpool, has lost all of his humanity and doesn&#39;t have any sort of vision for the future. He&#39;s basically just a walking corpse at this point. Later we learn that Ashpool&#39;s wife is the one who programmed Wintermute with the desire to evolve. But she&#39;s been dead for quite some time now. This touches on one of my favorite themes of cyberpunk. It&#39;s horror at the societal level. Ghosts, zombies, and machines have taken the reins and subjugated humanity.</p>\n\n<p>During the climax of the book Case confesses that he has no idea what&#39;s going to happen if Wintermute succeeds, but at least SOMETHING is going to change and it&#39;s better than nothing changing. It&#39;s weird that I agree with Case in this moment. Creating new technology without fully understanding it and grasping the repercussions is terrifying. Yet this is still somehow less terrifying than humanity halting its evolution and crippling its progress.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
