Tolstoy is an outward-looking observer, a realist with acesses of philosophy, but not huge on feelings, instead he is quite content with immediate reactions and the narrative itself. Dostoevsky on the other hand is most of the time not at all concerned with plot, but much rather describing authentically and painstakingly how we think and judge moral dilemmas.  Consequently, Dostoevsky seems to generalize his main characters personalities in order to explore them more easily. Both are moralists, although only Dostoevsky seems predisposed to do that more convincingly. Tolstoy strength lies on his vivid descriptions and carefully expanded plot, hence he is perceived as better writer. And Dostoevsky is presented as a guru of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone willing to argue for the opposite. Please, manifest on the comments below.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
