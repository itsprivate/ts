When you knew the Coterie had been in his head?) and how much abuse Hobb piled on him.

Though, to be honest, I&#39;ve seen the same justification for Harry Potter&#39;s stupid behavior as well as other heroes (Rand Al Thor, looking at you)--and while I can see the logic of it, I don&#39;t particularly like reading about it.  </p>\n\n<p>in any case, just started the Tawny Man trilogy and am hopeful that now that Fitz is 35, he&#39;ll be a bit more seasoned and smart.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
