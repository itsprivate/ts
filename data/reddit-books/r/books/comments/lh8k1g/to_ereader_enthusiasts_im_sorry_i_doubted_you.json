It's so much easier to read for a long time on an eReader than on a laptop or tablet, because it's specifically designed for reading, and it's gentle on the eyes.  \n\\- Convenience. I love being able to get samples and buy stuff with one click (very dangerous!). Also, I'll be moving in a few months, and I want all my fun books in one place to take with me.  \n\\- Discounted prices. This was less of a concern, but it's definitely another plus for me.\n\nIt's the best purchase I've made in a long time. I'm tracking all the books I'm reading, and I've read a book a week since buying it! My favorite was Circe. I also liked Piranesi and The Ocean at the End of Lane, though not as much. Currently making my way through Song of Achilles, and reading short stories from Fragile Things in between shifts and studying.\n\nSo, to eReader enthusiasts, I'm sorry I doubted you! I've been converted, and I'm so happy that I've come back to reading after so long.\n\nFor those of you who use eReaders, how did you get into it, and why?",
