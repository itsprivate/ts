I could easily see this premise going off the rails or becoming mean spirited but it never does. It always manages to be fun and funny while always being strangely endearing. Also through the translation notes after every chapter I’ve learned a lot about Buddhism and Japanese cultural things. If you need a positive little read, I highly recommend this one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
