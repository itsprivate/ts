I knew it'd be good but oh boy, did it exceed my expectations. \n\nThis truly felt like a novel and yet the knowing this disaster was all to real made it an even more compelling read. Krakauer has a way of writing that makes you feel right there with the people he writes about. And while scaling the everest would never have made my bucket list, and even more so now, the book made me yearb for those untouched landscapes and wilderness.\n\nOne thing that really struck me is how Krakauer, one of the few that mostly out of luck survived the ordeal on Mt. Everest blames himself in several occasions. At one point, he wonders if having a journalist, himself, along in the expedition would have caused everybody else to push themselves harder than needed, knowing that everything they did or didn't do would be carefully recorded. Later in the book, as Krakauer's climbing down the summit he recalls meeting one of the guides seemingly weak and in distress but in a bad state himself, he doesn't question the man reassurance he's fine and doesn't insisist offering help. As he writes Krakauer beats himself up for that, admitting that had that man been a friend he usually climbed with, he would have never left him alone there. \n\nKnowing Krakauer wrote this account only weeks after surviving the Everest disaster, it truly made me feel for him. As he had recorded conversations and kept a diary of their journey, it was natural he'd be the one to write about the experience but I can't imagine the responsibility of it.\n\nIn my constant search for good audiobooks I found that Into thin Air is narrated by Jon Krakauer. You can really feel the emotional weight certain scenes carry as he recounts the events. I really had goosebumps at several points throughout the audiobook. \n\nOverall, a fantastic, gut-wrenching book that makes you question these people common sense while marvelling at how much duller our regular lives are in comparison.\n\nHighly recommended!",
