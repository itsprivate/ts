This book had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, cheering for the characters and flat out crying by the end of it.

The description of their journey back to Boulder was just so heartwarming. I am definitely having the “after finishing a really good book” depression lol. Please tell me I’m not the only one who gets this feeling after finishing an amazing read. What did you think of this book and what are your favorite Stephen King works?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
