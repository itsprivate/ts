I’m interested to hear your answers and maybe some of these books are actually on my list.</p>\n\n<p>The first one for me is one of Us is lying by Karen McManus. On my huge list I have a lot of murder mysteries and this is the first one I’m going to read. I heard it’s a mix of that and the breakfast club which already sounds interesting so I’m looking forward to this book</p>\n\n<p>Next on my list is Dorothy must die by Danielle Paige. This interest me because this is a continuation on Wizard of Oz but with a twist. I’m always up for reading alternate reality versions of stories. The Disney Twisted tales are also on my list</p>\n\n<p>Third book is Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. I really enjoyed the first movie and I’ve heard that the book is very different and darker and I want to see how much I enjoy it</p>\n\n<p>So again: what are the three books next on your to read list? It doesn’t have to be three. maybe if you want to list one or two that works as well</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
