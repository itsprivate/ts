But i can safely say that it&#39;s a must read for any person who likes real life emotional stories. It&#39;s a perfect coming of age story. </p>\n\n<p>From the start you can tell that the book has two main characters. Trevor and his amazing mom. I have nothing but respect for this strong woman. And the way he describes the environment makes you able to find beauty  even in the chaos of post apartheid south africa. You get glimpses of what it was like growing up in such a difficult environment. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone else read the book? I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
