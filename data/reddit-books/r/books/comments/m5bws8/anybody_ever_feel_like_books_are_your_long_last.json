When I read a fantasy book in particular I find it like building a relationship. Sometimes I feel lonely or maybe think I am but when I read I feel an immersive about of joy or a sense of belonging with the characters. I suppose that is the point with books but it&#39;s so fun to just keep gaining &quot;friends&quot; or relationships through novels. I was wondering if this is a common occurrence I believe it is. What is your experience with reading regarding loneness or combating a relationship with the characters? Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
