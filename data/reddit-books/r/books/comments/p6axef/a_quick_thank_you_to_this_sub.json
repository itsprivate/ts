I had reached a point where i was tired of social media, but couldnt find a way to break free. After scrolling through a few posts, i found the book club pick for the month.  I went to my local library the next week and renewed my card (after 20 years of inactivity) and checked out &quot;there there&quot; by Tommy Orange.  It took me a few days to get into a groove, but by the end i was reading not out of obligation but enjoyment.  Its various depictions of native american life in a modern world was intriguing.  I also enjoyed how all the threads/stories came together in the end for an explosive finish.  I had seen movies/tv shows attempt to do this over the years, but having the scenes play in my head after reading felt more... real i guess is how id drscribe it.  Since then, i have read at least a chapter of something every week, and have finished over 100 books!  This year i have actually already hit my goal of 50 books read!  Thank you all for the reccomendations, discussions, reviews of literature both old/new, and support.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
