Wouldn&#39;t maybe trying to figure out the famine crises be a better use of time? A main plot point in the book is about major corporations producing new media and entertainment so its definitely not a universe where things stopped being made in the 80&#39;s. So why not just have a small group of folks in a club be into this stuff? Why does it have to be the whole planet? Damn y&#39;all, move on. </p>\n\n<p>Japanese culture fetish. Yeah just complete that circle. </p>\n\n<p>In halfway through it. This book just came to life too day &quot;oh you like the Clash? Name every song that hit the US charts in the order they were released in the UK.&quot; Then it called me a slut.</p>\n\n<p>And I know this is an audiobook issue not the material but there really should have been a producer or someone who could correct Wil Wheatons pronunciations of certain words. He&#39;s mispronounced things like Aspergers (aspejers) and library (liberry).</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, this is just sad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
