One of the most intrepid journalists I&#39;ve ever encountered in nonfiction, he beautifully captures both the horrific conditions these migrants face while simultaneously highlighting the perseverance and bravery of the migrants he encounters.</p>\n\n<p>Pardon my language, but he didn&#39;t half-ass this story. He literally jumps the train (aka &quot;The Beast), riding the same rails that have maimed and killed so many before him. He heads deep into cartel territory to try and capture the fear that they&#39;ve gripped the nation with. He interviews trafficked women to try and bring their story to light. One of his contacts on the journey calls him as he&#39;s captured by the cartel. He encounters corrupt officials and indifferent law enforcement officers. It&#39;s an absolutely harrowing journey that he somehow captures with steadfast determination and grace. Anyone who is at all interested in this subject matter, or even if you&#39;re not, should absolutely read this book. </p>\n\n<p>The only regret I don&#39;t have is that I don&#39;t speak Spanish and had to read a translated version. Those who do speak the language, I&#39;d recommend reading the original entitled &quot;Los migrantes que no importan&quot; (The Migrants Who Don&#39;t Matter)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
