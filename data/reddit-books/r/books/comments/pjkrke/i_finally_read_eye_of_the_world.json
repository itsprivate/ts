This was a joy to read. Despite having heard the series’ praises for years, it still managed to surprise me. The thing that surprised me most was the pacing. After having been warned about it for years, I mostly adored it in this book. There&#39;s always a new event or reveal of information that propels our main cast on an emotional journey as intense as the literal one.</p>\n\n<p>The sheer amount of things covered in this book’s worldbuilding astounds me. We’ve got cursed objects, prophecies, time shenanigans, dimensional travel, political rivalries, spiritual connections to animals, military ranks, and countless even local festivals. I was excited to open the book again because there was a promise for something new. Most compellingly, the slower chapters highlighted how much the characters had changed on their journey. The chances they got to breathe showed human characters struggling to come to grips with a world bigger than they could have imagined.</p>\n\n<p>It helps that the world is cool. I don&#39;t think I want to know how many named characters feature in this story. I don&#39;t know how Jordan and his editing team managed to keep everything straight. The idea that he&#39;s done this for an additional twelve books both inspires and intimidates me.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this constant flow of new information feeds my least favourite part of the book. Things never stopped being introduced. Perhaps I just forgot about some of the terms and figures, but I entered the climax with a greater sense of “okay, this is happening now” than a sense of finality.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, since this is just the end of one volume in a much longer series, perhaps it’s unfair to judge the pilot episode for making the reader want more context. Maybe it&#39;s exactly what it needs to be. After all, it did the ultimate job of making me want to read more of the series.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, I want to see what happens to these characters. They&#39;ve already gone through so much. Jordan has left a hell of a promise of what these characters will experience in their role in destiny. More than this, though, I just want to hang out with these characters.</p>\n\n<p>I am under no delusions about binging the whole series in a short time, but I’m glad I finally started it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
