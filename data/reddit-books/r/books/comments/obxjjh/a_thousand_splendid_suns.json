It&#39;s a culture shock, a ticket to a whole other world. He puts you in the shoes of women with lives and hardships I couldn&#39;t begin to fathom. The things they went through, the incredible loss and uncertain future, Hosseini has you feel all of it. The entire time we&#39;re also witnessing Afghanistan with the rise and fall of the Soviets, Jihad, and then the Taliban.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t include spoilers because everyone should experience the book blind. There are moments where I audibly gasped or yelled or said, &quot;oh shit.&quot; I&#39;m struggling to artfully articulate exactly what I&#39;m feeling right now about this story; I can&#39;t find the words for it. </p>\n\n<p>I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone. It&#39;s deep, insightful, heart-wrenching, and enchanting. It&#39;s incredible. </p>\n\n<p>The only trouble I had reading the story was making connections with the names and places. They were hard for me to pronounce and remember. Not so much the names of the main characters or places like Kabul, but a few of the minor/fleeting names often slipped my mind. The craziest thing for me was seeing a different side in a horrible situation. A long time ago, one of the men in my family was killed at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Ever since, my stepmother and grandma ranted and raved about how horrible the people of Afghanistan are. Taliban and civilians alike. Though I never bought much into their condemnations of the civilians, seeing the distrust and equal, if not more, dislike for them is comforting, which sounds weird to say. And I hope the meaning of that isn&#39;t skewed. I&#39;m not pleased about their suffering, not in the slightest. But my family always talked about how thankful the people of Afghanistan were for the Taliban. And in the story, they do cheer for the arrival of the Taliban at one point. However, their hopes for a brighter future were quickly dashed. Because they were duped. I know the book is fiction, but it&#39;s realistic fiction. There must be some truth to it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m an American blessed with opportunities and privileges I often disregard or forget. This book makes me remember what I have and should be thankful for. It also reminds me of the suffering of others in a place I know so little about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
