Crawford writes a coming-of-age memoir of her privileged life at an elite boarding school (St Paul’s School) in Concord, New Hampshire in the early 90s, where she suffered numerous instances of sexual abuse. It is fascinating for many reasons. She goes into great detail about life at the school, the routine, the traditions, the social hierarchy and how kids fall in and out of favor. \n\nOne thing that resonated with me was the classic social-culture of that time period. I grew up in the 80s and 90s so this double standard that I quoted really resonated with me. I guess it made me wonder, are we still in this same mind-set today? A lot of people avoid memoirs such as this, like Mary Karr’s The Liar’s Club, but I think they’re important reads. Just wanted to share and unpack.",
