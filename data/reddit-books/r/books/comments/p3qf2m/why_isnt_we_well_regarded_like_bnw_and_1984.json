The ending hit me like a brick, and the prose throughout does an excellent job of conveying D-503&#39;s thoughts and emotions as they change. The last chapter as it snaps back to that cold, emotionless tone it had at the beginning from the scattered, frantic tone in the middle was heavy. It really drove home the futility of the entire struggle, kinda like the end of &#39;1984&#39; with Big Brother winning.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows about the other novels I mentioned, but almost no one I know has read &#39;We&#39; and I was curious about why? It is an excellent book and very similar to &#39;1984&#39;, is it just not as well known or is there some other reasons why it&#39;s not as famous?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
