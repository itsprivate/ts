Why aren&#39;t YOU that person? Easy, they just work harder than you. LOL no. I love the opening chapters of this book because it gives you the familiar synopsis &quot;This self made man was born of poor immigrant parents, but through hard work, determination, and skill he became rich and successful&quot; Then the book deconstructs that myth of meritocracy. It points out how luck, something out of our control, plays such a massive factor in whether or not someone will become an Outlier of massive success. Bill Gates had 7 years of programming experience starting at age 14 by pure chance, being raised by a computer lab of which only a few existed in the world at the time! It takes 10,000 hours (roughly 10 years in a work schedule) to become a master at something and we see Bill Gates, the Beatles, and so many others get this opportunity. When you&#39;re born is equally as important, too early or too late and you can&#39;t take advantage of the opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the book made me feel a bit better because in our society we contribute success to effort and skill while placing a person who isn&#39;t successful as lacking discipline, and talent. There are a myriad of factors to becoming successful</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
