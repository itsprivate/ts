We went to a library book sale on our first date.  I proposed to her at the same library book sale 13 months later using a copy of her favorite book made into a book safe.  This is a woman who idolized Belle not for the romantic love story, but for her library and who wants (wanted?) a rolling library ladder some day.    </p>\n\n<p>But we&#39;ve basically come to the conclusion that we don&#39;t feel the need any longer to have a massive collection of books.  We don&#39;t need to own all the books we want to read.  We&#39;re going to start paring down, donating to our local mission for them to sell to fund their efforts.  We&#39;re going to catalog the books as we go so we know what we have/had and we&#39;re going to keep one-ish bookshelf with special books, books that changed us, signed first editions, etc.  The rest, we&#39;re getting rid of.  The entire Harry Potter collection, gone.  6 of the 7 copies of Devil in the White City, gone.  (she has a bad problem with buying that book every time she sees it.....)  Every copy except a &quot;reading copy,&quot; the signed copy, and book safe version of A Team of Rivals is out the door.  </p>\n\n<p>Now we just have to find a time to start.  I guess I didn&#39;t really have a reason for this post.  How about this; have you ever found yourself changing like this, going from collecting/hoarding/accumulating to dispersing and getting rid of?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
