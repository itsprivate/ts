I got excited as usual and read it, only to be disappointed. I couldn&#39;t understand a thing which was written and the characters weren&#39;t all well developed, especially Delphi.

Her origins was also very weird and unbelievable.</p>\n\n<p>I got sadder when I found out the it wasn&#39;t even written by JK Rowling. I personally think it was a useless sequal. So much stuff fitted into a medium sized book. So, my question is, are these events even canon in the wizarding world? Oh I hope not because it would ruin my childhood. What are your opinions on this book?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
