If you see someone say, &quot;I like reading books&quot; it&#39;s mostly girls who are obsessed with Wattpad. It&#39;s alright, a book is a book regarding the story, but I just want people to read. Most of us are addicted to a game called Mobile Legends, so they have no time to read. Maybe it&#39;s just because I have been an avid reader my whole life, but maybe I&#39;m just salty that I couldn&#39;t find a bookstore or library.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
