I&#39;m sure Slaughterhouse Five has been praised to all hell and I probably won&#39;t add much to the overall conversation, but I just wanted to give this book some praise. </p>\n\n<p>It had me laughing out loud at parts, and almost crying during other parts. It&#39;s one of the weirdest books I&#39;ve ever read, but not in a bad way. It&#39;s just not structured like very many books that I&#39;ve read. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know that Kurt Vonnegut was actually a POW in WW2 until reading this. The way he describes his time there is brutal and hard to read. There&#39;s a specific scene where Billy is watching a war film in reverse while waiting to be abducted by the flying saucer. The way the scene is written had me tearing it. It&#39;s a simple scene, but it&#39;s powerful. Also, the image of the train cars of POW&#39;s seeming like one organism to the guards is haunting to me. The idea that they just pass in food and out comes excrement through the vents. It&#39;s completely dehumanizing and that image will probably stick with me forever. There are many other scenes that come to mind, but I don&#39;t want to drone on. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously we all know WW2 or any war for that matter were absolutely terrible, but this book really drilled it into my head how lucky I am to have never went through anything like that. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short... I love this book. I&#39;ll definitely be reading more Vonnegut in the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
