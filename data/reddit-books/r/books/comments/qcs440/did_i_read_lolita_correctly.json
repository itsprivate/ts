Humbert Humbert was an egotistical, manipulative asshole, and I just don&#39;t understand how he can draw in real life people with just some fancy words. Apparently people have to constantly remind themselves that he&#39;s a pedophile/rapist. I, alternatively, had to constantly remind myself that he&#39;s supposed to be charming. Literally everything he said was just to cover up what he did with pretty wording and dry wit... Am... Am I reading this right? Like did I didn&#39;t miss anything right?</p>\n\n<p>ALSO, I was really not prepared for Lolitas ending. It kinda messed me up. Anybody got anything to say that&#39;ll cheer me up?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
