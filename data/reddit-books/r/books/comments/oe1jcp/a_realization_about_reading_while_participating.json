The characters are different from me, why would I pass up the opportunity of understanding how someone other than me thinks?”</p>\n\n<p>I’ve always prided myself on being able to see situations from different perspectives, but it wasn’t until I did this study that I realized I learned how to do that by reading books. </p>\n\n<p>It is very useful to be able to understand someone else’s motivations, even if you personally would have done differently. </p>\n\n<p>Reading has made me more empathetic of my fellow humans. :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
