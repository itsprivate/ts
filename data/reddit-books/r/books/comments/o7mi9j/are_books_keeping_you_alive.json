But now I started thinking- I don&#39;t have much of a social life, nor do I have lasting friendships. College is still underway, so I am not making strides in my career. Essentially, I don&#39;t have any billionaire-ish achievements in my kitty. I could but don&#39;t want to club/party and so I am content at home. But I do wake up everyday with the goal of completing all my other work till a predetermined time and finally get on with my book (s). Do you, like me, also feel this way? If you do, is it healthy to have this sort of a dependence (the friend in question told me, I think playfully, that I shouldn&#39;t be dependent on anything for my happiness)?</p>\n\n<p>Please just tell me I am not alone. This is not like a phase for me. It is really a therapeutic activity-reading. I feel the happiest when books surround me and I need to be engaged in the task to feel like I did something with my day. I mean I will get on with other things in life too, but I don&#39;t know whether as an old person, I&#39;ll be very different or adventurous or doing exciting things. I&#39;m happy and content where I am- cozy in my reading nook :D</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
