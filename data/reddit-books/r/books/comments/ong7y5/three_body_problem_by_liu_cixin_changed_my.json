These are people and I see myself in them, sometimes corrupted, insecure and confused. Living a human experience is a wild ride, we keep on failing, suffering, but we keep on thriving and surviving. Damn I wish I can tell more. </p>\n\n<p>For me, Three Body Problem is just an appetizer, Dark Forest is the dessert and Death&#39;s End is the main course.
