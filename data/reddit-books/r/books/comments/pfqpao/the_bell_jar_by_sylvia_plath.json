  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>RATING: 4.25/5</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am, I am, I am.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I heard of this book when I was 17, after which I slipped into a paralysing depressive episode and physically feared the power this book held over me. I couldn&#39;t read for the next two years. So I am glad that I picked it up again, thanks to my bookclub. I treaded carefully this time, understanding the importance to detach myself from Esther Greenwood. So finishing this book felt like a personal achievement for me, although I felt I shared a brain with Esther when I was 17, there she was and here I am, better than before, and healed. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Because wherever I sat-i would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The book is loosely inspired from Plath&#39;s own life, and her untimely death. It is evident, that Plath is writing about her struggles, through experience, rather than assumption of this illness. At some areas, her writing is so striking that it starts to get to you. I believe, that a part of her wanted to heal and live, just like Esther. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I saw myself, sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death just because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The book is broken in pieces, describing various occurrences of Esther&#39;s life , separated with the use of a news headlines, until she becomes one, the amount headlines being directly proportional to her mental state. Her narration has a distracted manner to it, often isolating her in social situations, while she relives her past, and in a way the entire book seems to give off a dazed effect, similar to anyone who often finds themselves dissociating in uncomfortable circumstances. There are lot of difficult themes discovered in the book such as, &quot;gifted kid burnout&quot; syndrome, the conversations around &quot;purity&quot; while being religiously bound from sexual exploration, the need for a women to be married and have children, and the ethics of shock therapy and lobotomy, making powerful appearances and striking much needed conversations. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The silence depressed me. It wasn&#39;t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And lastly , \nMuch love to Sylvia Plath for I feel like I owe her something.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
