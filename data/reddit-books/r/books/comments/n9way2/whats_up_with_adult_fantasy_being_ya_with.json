I am very interested in non-fiction books (about history in general, but also other topics that I find interesting), but have since started to miss diving and becoming attached to those universes I spent weeks and months in back then.\n\nI started using GoodReads to search for stuff to read. I haven't been in touch with the book community for so long I don't know what's good anymore, so naturally I've navigated a bit on the most popular books and the awards section for 2020.\n\nI tried my hands on a few books I found there, mainly fantasy. And god, they're bad. My latest try was with Sarah J. Maas' House of Earth and Blood, and I couldn't get past page 100. It seems every fantasy book I find is aimed at a young and unnecessarily edgy public. I don't need to see the MC swear \"gods-damned f\\*ing sh\\*t\" every 3 dialogues to get the impression that it is \"adult\". I also heavily dislike the fact that every female character is insanely hot and every male character is a testosterone-dripping chad who's clearly very toxic. Those reads are just so... unnatural and cringey.\n\nSo, how can I bypass this? What are some good places to find alternatives and/or better reads?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Since many of you are recommending books and series, I should add that I am not looking specifically for high fantasy. I'm interested in urban fantasy, sci-fi, low fantasy, cyberpunk and everything in between.",
