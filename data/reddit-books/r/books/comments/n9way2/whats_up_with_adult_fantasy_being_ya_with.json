I haven't been in touch with the book community for so long I don't know what's good anymore, so naturally I've navigated a bit on the most popular books and the awards section for 2020.\n\nI tried my hands on a few books I found there, mainly fantasy. And god, they're bad. My latest try was with Sarah J. Maas' House of Earth and Blood, and I couldn't get past page 100. It seems every fantasy book I find is aimed at a young and unnecessarily edgy public.
