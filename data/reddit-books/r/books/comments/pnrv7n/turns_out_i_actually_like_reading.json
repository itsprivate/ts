I haven&#39;t read an actual book in years, not since high school, so I wasn&#39;t expecting much from myself.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 4 weeks, however, I have now read 4 books and am currently on the 5th! I haven&#39;t read that many books in the last 10 years, never mind in a month. I started off with Born a Crime, by Trevor Noah. I know absolutely nothing about him but the book was well reviewed and seemed interesting, so I gave it shot. I really enjoyed reading about his experiences and I flew through it. There&#39;s something about autobiographies that hook me more than fiction. For some reason, I find it easier to immerse myself in someone&#39;s lived experiences, rather than something fictitious (and therefore somewhat arbitrary, in my opinion). </p>\n\n<p>What I realized is that I never liked reading when I was younger because I was always told what to read and when to read it by. It always felt like an obligation or a chore, not something you do for fun. But now that I am the one choosing what I want to read and setting my own pace, it&#39;s fantastic. I don&#39;t even play video games anymore, I just read!</p>\n\n<p>Also, I much prefer reading on an ereader to reading a physical book. No old book smell, no flipping pages, no having to read with a light nearby. Every book I could ever want is at my fingertips in a device that allows me to take my entire library with me wherever I want. If I see a book on this subreddit or Goodreads that I&#39;m interested in, I can have it in seconds. Honestly, this device has been revelatory and it&#39;s probably the best purchase I have made in a long time. I feel like I&#39;ve discovered a whole new world. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I just wanted to share my new found excitement for reading and thought maybe my experience would encourage someone to get back into reading as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
