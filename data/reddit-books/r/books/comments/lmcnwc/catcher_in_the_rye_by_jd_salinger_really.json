Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, A Tale of Two Cities, whenever I have tried reading these books I could hardly even understand them let alone enjoy it. However, I was recommended The Catcher in the Rye by a really good friend. It's her favorite and I trust her judgement so I gave it a try. It was amazing, I don't know if it was supposed to be funny but I found the way Holden narrated everything  annoying but hilarious at the same time. He  exaggerated everything  and made stuff seem so much more important than it may have actually been. I'm glad I gave this book a try. I also loved how true everything Holden said was, sometimes he was over the top, but I could always see what he was getting at and thought that he had somewhat of a point. I believe everyone should read this book, there's so much you can pull from it, and many different ways to interpret what actually happens to Holden.",
