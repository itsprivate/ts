I remember seeing a post on here - something along the lines of &#39;after the first 200 pages it really kicks in&#39; - and I couldn&#39;t agree more. This time last week I was 280 pages in after 3 months of on and off reading, and I&#39;ve just stormed through the remaining 1000. Granted, the sheer amount of characters and the way Tolstoy uses different names for them is confusing at the start, but it really isn&#39;t too hard to get your head around once you get invested in the characters! </p>\n\n<p>The opera scene and the Battle of Borodino may go down as some of my favourite passages in any book I&#39;ve read. Believe me, this book was not at all in my comfort zone, I&#39;d never usually read anything like this; but it just felt so <em>alive</em>, it&#39;s hard to put into words right now after just finishing. I might have to edit and add thoughts after I&#39;ve fully processed everything hahaha</p>\n\n<p>I find myself a bit lost now. I&#39;m used to having a &#39;challenging&#39; or &#39;behemoth&#39; of a book to read alongside my other book of choice. I&#39;ve got Infinite Jest, 2666, Gravity&#39;s Rainbow and Don Quixote all lined up on my bookshelf, but I think I may need a few days to give my brain a severe holiday before I jump into one of those.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
