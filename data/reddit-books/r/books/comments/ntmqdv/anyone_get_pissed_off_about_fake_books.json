He also admitted that that's exactly what he did in his office and has no intention of reading them. I don't know why but that pissed me off a bit. I personally refuse to own any books that I will not read. I have given away, such books in the past. I like to keep my bookshelf filled with books/things I treasure. I hate the idea of using books for just aesthetic and decor. It seems to lack character. And I unintentionally lose respect for the people who never read books and only buy them to decorate their house. Like stop faking a lifestyle that you are not willing to commit to. \n\nThanks for reading my rant, folks. Have a good day!",
