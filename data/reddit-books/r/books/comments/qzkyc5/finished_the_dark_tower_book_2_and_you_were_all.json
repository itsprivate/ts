The lobstrosities and their speech. The speech reminds me so much of another King character but I can&#39;t remember which one. I&#39;m thinking it was from a book where they are some kind of monsters/aliens buried in a pit. I can&#39;t remember the book for the life of me and I could be very wrong about which story it was. Can anyone think of which character I&#39;m referring to? I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m being vague but I read a lot of books so can&#39;t always remember the whole story. The speech they used was similar to how the lobstrosities speak.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
