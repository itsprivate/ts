In reality, it was on my list forever having read about how prolific a novel it is and I was not disappointed! Not only did it feel like an insane achievement to read that long of a book, but the world building and character development were second to none and perhaps my favorite of any book. Herbert really took his time unravelling a massive cast of characters and making Arrakis feel like a character in and of itself. I know it&#39;s quite the popular and important piece of literature, so let me hear your thoughts on it! Did you love it? Hate it? Why? Excited for the movie? Have at it!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
