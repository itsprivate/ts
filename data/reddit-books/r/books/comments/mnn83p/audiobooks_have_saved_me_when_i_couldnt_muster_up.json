Reading had become an unenjoyable chore. So I stopped reading entirely. Then one day I came across a trailer forNeil Gaiman's The Sandman audiobook adaptation on YouTube. Having already read the entire comic series I was intrigued and wanted to listen to it. So, I joined audible and listened to the book during the trial period and I actually enjoyed it. It was a dramatic narration with multiple Hollywood voice actors and excellent sound effects. I had 2 more free credits left and I bought Cixuan Li's 3 Body Problem. I'm a huge achieve fiction fan.I really felt comfortable listening to the book and slowly reading kind of became fun again. Now I'm listening to more and more audiobooks. I find that fiction is better suited for the audiobook medium. Most recently, I listened to the Dune trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nIt makes me so happy that, I'm finally able to enjoy \"reading\" again. I'm working on improving my mental health and to be able to read again is helping me out a lot. I just wanted to share my experience with you guys because, I feel like this sub understands what I'm going through and I hope that this might help people who are stuck like me.",
