And considering that I move around a lot because of university, it&#39;s the most cost-effective solution. Can I just say, thank you Amazon for inventing such a wonderful device. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve managed to read 1 book a week, because it&#39;s just so convenient! And the selections, oh my god, the selections. Every book I&#39;ve read the past weeks has been a 5 star read. I also have carpal tunnel syndrome, so reading physical books was really painful for me. I also have migraines so my Kindle has been really useful because it doesn&#39;t have the usual Ipad glare. </p>\n\n<p>I still miss the feel of a real physical book-- the smell, aesthetics, etc. I know I said I don&#39;t have to switch completely to a Kindle, but I think I&#39;m never reading a physical book again, unless it&#39;s gifted to me. </p>\n\n<p>And with regards to my dream of having my own home library, I guess in the future, when I&#39;m more financially stable, I&#39;ll buy physical books but still read on my Kindle. 😂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
