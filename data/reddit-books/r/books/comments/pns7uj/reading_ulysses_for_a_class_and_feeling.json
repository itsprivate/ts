I guess that&#39;s good for me. I&#39;ve just never felt this lost or helpless in a literature class, not with Milton, or Blake, or Woolf, or TS Eliot.</p>\n\n<p>I spent many many hours preparing for class this week, reading and annotating the assigned chapters along with the footnotes and outside sources, then re-reading the text. I&#39;m enjoying myself, too, and I find extra research enhances my experience of reading. I went into the seminar today a bit overwhelmed and confused about some things but mostly excited and ready to learn and discuss, but I left feeling totally discouraged and incompetent, humiliated even. I felt as if I hadn&#39;t read anything at all. Despite doing everything I could to prepare, could not answer the questions he posed with anything intelligible. It was as if I had been reading a different text. I&#39;m not really seeing the whole picture, or even beginning to see it. In the past, I was almost always able to at least ask the right questions or have some inkling as to the bigger picture. I always felt like I was having little epiphanies as the professor spoke. But somethings off now. I can&#39;t grasp at anything.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is good for me. Some humility. But if even after all that preparation, I am still this lost and incompetent, what does that say about me as a reader/student?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
