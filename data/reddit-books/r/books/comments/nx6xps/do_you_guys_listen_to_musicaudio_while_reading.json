I am someone who is used to either listening to music or T.V. in the background of almost everything I do, including sleeping. I often find myself distracted by these while reading, so I have just been reading in silence. \n\nSomething about sitting in silence for so long in a concentrated state really bugs me, and makes me quickly switch to something else since I can't have that \"part\" of my brain occupied.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has this issue or if anyone has found an approach to listening to something while reading that works for them? I am thinking the next time I sit and read to try some \"ambient\" music or maybe some white noise/background sounds. \n\nThanks all",
