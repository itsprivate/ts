Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Fredrik himself will be joining us for an AMA<strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people\">Goodreads</a> (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking at real estate isn&#39;t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. [...]  </p>\n\n<p>Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in a motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>!Content Warning! (potential spoilers) - <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Suicide</span></p>\n\n<p>You may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Don&#39;t worry about joining later on in the month. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up and you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to view any past book club selection or want to see how things work, you may find the complete archive <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/bookclub\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you that are viewing reddit on the redesigned desktop version you will see an option on this post to &#39;follow&#39;. If you &#39;follow&#39; the book club post you will receive a notification when a new post, a discussion thread for book club, is added to the collection. It is still being tested, so it may not be perfect, but perhaps it will make it easier to join the discussions when they go up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
