I picked it up since I never really read it and it kept mentioning Watership Down so I decided to read that next. Watership Down was a great book and I'm glad I got to read it on my own terms and I don't have to analyze it in a certain way. To me, that makes it so much more enjoyable. I don't know what it is about Richard Adams' writing, but I love how there's so much description among the action. \n\nI was definitely expecting a lot more death and violence since I saw a few clips of the movie years ago. The book felt cozy and when I was talking about it with my brother, I told him how it kind of reminded me of Lord of the Rings. My brother said that that's why he would describe it as an 'epic.' I have more to say, but it would just be more rambling.",
