The history of the \"greatest country in the world\" ought not to have been doubted, criticized, or otherwise questioned in any form. There was only one \"true\" history of \"God's chosen country,\" and it was treated as sacred. If you grew up in a similar schooling system, you're likely familiar with this narrative. Something along the lines of a grand adventure, a noble rebellion against oppressors, of the installation of the greatest government in the world–supposedly designed for the benefit and empowerment of \"We the people.\" And about all the many different old white men who were really cool and had lots of great ideas or whatever. \n\nThis book turns that narrative on its head. It goes through everything, from Columbus all the way up to Bush Jr's election, but it does so from the perspectives of the people on the ground, the people who got the short end, who were exploited, who were caught in the cross hairs of America's chronic militarism. The people. It chronicles the hundreds of thousands of groups of millions of people spanning centuries, forming together and standing up for what they believed was right. Proper working conditions, human rights, civil rights, humane prisons, voting rights, basic human necessities. It shows how the country's history of war, conquest, and imperialistic tendancies do not make for a feel-good story of a country defending \"freedom\" and \"democracy.\" It lays out the sleezy relationship between the government and corporations, how the military budget has been steadily inflating all the while, to the point of insanity. These are all things I had virtually no knowledge of before this book, and I feel I am at least a slightly better person coming out of it. \n\nThe author addresses the \"skewed\" view of our history, how listing all worst parts of history can seem to be unfair. He doesn't worry about it. He notes that, while it is true that his personal views are made clear throughout the book, this is natural. Historians, unconsciously or not, imbue personal opinions into the record, simply by way of choosing which facts are included, and which facts are omitted. He explains how he felt compelled to write a \"new\" history–not in the sense that it is invented, but that it is the history of the stories either not told or quickly skimmed over. The book is intended to be a counterweight against the idea that America is the greatest country in the world, blameless with the exception of a few misteps here and there. The truth is that these \"misteps\" were calculated decisions that were made sometimes at the cost of hundreds of thousands of human lives, innocent people, and I believe it's important to learn about them, because the consequences of those decisions are still felt today. \n\nIt was a humbling, sobering journey. I am relatively new to reading, and am constantly/will always be learning more. I'd love to hear your questions and/or thoughts, even if you disagree! Thank you for reading :)",
