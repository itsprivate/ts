I am familiar with the more science fiction works by Le Guin (Hainish Cycle) and this was my first venture into her take on fantasy, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nFirst of all, this is a very simple story.  This isn't a book about magic and adventure, despite both being heavily present in it. It uses those elements to tell a story about self-discovery and self-understanding, of youth and the mistakes and pain that comes with them.  A coming-of-age story if you might say.\n\nI suppose that is a lot of Le Guin, and that's why she is one of my favorite authors:  She creates these expansive fantastical worlds as stages to tell the most human of stories. Her prose is so dang eloquent and profound without crossing the line into pretentiousness - I love reading it out loud.  I know a lot of fantasy and science fiction fanatics may not enjoy the slowness/\"lack of action\" that comes with her style, and that's okay, but personally I find her quiet narration to be so pleasant.\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea takes you on an adventure peppered with mysterious islands and wizards, but I'm not writing this to deconstruct the book, and I could say so much about it. But I'm writing this to process how Ged's story walked me through my personal journey with trauma. This wasn't probably Le Guin's intention, or what most people read into it, but it was very parallel to what I have experienced recovering from an unexpected and painful moment in my life.\n\n(SPOILERS) Ged is being hunted by his own darkness - scared to a shadow of who he was, and stifling his development and potential, as a consequence of the damage that a traumatic event inflicted in him. He eventually decides to stop running away and confront this darkness, and even then he does not know what to do with it when he faces it. The darkness now eludes him, and it was only until he was filled with determination to confront it, name it and accept whatever may come from that - that he is able to successfully defeat it by becoming one with it.\n\nAnd this is \\*exactly\\* how I've experienced pain and loss for the last year and a half: I felt like its has hunted me, chased me as I try to go on with my life, but whatever happens, it still looms somewhere in the borders of my mind. Now through therapy and support from my family, I am trying to chase my personal darkness, but I keep trying to fight it headfirst and clasping at air. Reading how Ged finally defeats it by becoming one with it made me understand something very simple and obvious: That everything I feel will stay with me to a degree - it is now part of me. I cannot run away from it, I cannot make it disappear. I can only accept it, and that doesn't have to be a bad thing. We are everything that happens to us. There is no use fighting that, not even the painful parts, which in fact may the most important of experiences. Because...\n\nOnly in silence the word,\n\nOnly in dark the light,\n\nOnly in dying life:\n\nBright the hawk’s flight\n\nOn the empty sky.",
