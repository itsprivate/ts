I rarely have time to just sit down and read an actual book, but I have tons of downtime while commuting to work and things like that which would be perfect for an audiobook.  A few years back I decided to give one a try.  \n\nI decided that for my first audiobook I wanted to listen to something I was already familiar with so I didn't have to dedicate as much concentration to it since I would know the storyline, characters, etc.  I decided to go with Harry Potter.  It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.   I listened to the books while driving to and from work (or driving anywhere for that matter), while going for a walk at lunch, while walking the dog in the evening, while mowing the lawn, and probably during some other times.  I flew through the first book and then finished off the entire series.\n\nSince then I've listened to dozens of books that I never would have actually read if I only had access to ebooks or physical books.  I'm sure audiobooks aren't for everyone, but I recommend anyone who wants to read more, but doesn't have time to just sit down and read, give them a shot and listen during those times where you can do two things at once.\n\nSome of the series I've listened to are:\n\n* Harry Potter\n* Chronicles of Narnia\n* Wheel of Time\n\nIf you're not familiar with Overdrive and Libby, check them our for free audiobooks from your library system.\n\nGood Luck!",
