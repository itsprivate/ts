His earlier trilogy, <em>Ambergris</em>, is obscure enough that it was mostly out of print until a year ago when it was released in as an omnibus. After reading through the trilogy in a couple weeks, I am convinced it&#39;s small following is due to a lack of marketing and readers constantly misunderstanding what they&#39;re getting into when they come to it.</p>\n\n<p>Vandermeer employs strange literary devices to describe the interactions of the civilians of the vivid, strange city of Ambergris. At the core, Vandermeer is writing pure literary works here. Stylistically he reads far more like McCarthy, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway than the typical fantasy fiction juggernauts. Content-wise, his stories are streamlined on characters, just like any literary work. The fantasy elements are included in deeply human ways that force the reader to grapple with the fate of millions and what it means to witness and understand history.</p>\n\n<p>The books are sadly impossible to market. His later work found critical success with <em>Annihilation</em>, which could be pigeonholed as a thriller for marketing. <em>Ambergris</em> still sits in the background, mostly unread and avoided, which a real shame. You can classify it as weird fiction but that label will send away most of the readers who will truly love it, as you don&#39;t really expect to see a mushroom-world in literary canon.  I&#39;m fairly well-read and I was constantly amazed as Vandermeer showed me time and again things I never imagined in a book. His later work is more polished and marketable but this early trilogy arguably has more heart in it. I wonder if one day <em>Ambergris</em> will finally pick up steam and be recognized for what it is.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
