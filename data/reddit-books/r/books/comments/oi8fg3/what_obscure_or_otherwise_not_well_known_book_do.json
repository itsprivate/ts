It&#39;s pretty much a fantasy epic but with deers. Not anthropomorphic deers, literal deers. It&#39;s set in medieval Scotland and humans do play a part, kinda, but it&#39;s mostly just deers and other woodland critters. It features a chosen one plot, and one of the few examples of one that I actually enjoy. It also features death. Like, a lot of it. When I re-read it a few years back I remember to have thought &quot;holy crap, this is way more violent than I remembered&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not gonna go in depth with the themes, but I really like this book and its spiritual successor, <em>The Sight</em>, set in the same universe but with wolves instead of deers. <em>The Sight</em> is even darker than <em>The Firebringer</em> and doesn&#39;t require any knowledge from the latter. I think some might like <em>The Sight</em> better, but I have a special place in my heart for <em>The Firebringer</em>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
