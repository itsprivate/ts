Even while on my 5 year hiatus from reading, I saw it. Because it&#39;s way too common. Now that I&#39;m getting back into it, I just see it too often. </p>\n\n<p>Usually not stated as outright opinions, but reflected in insults or passive aggressiveness towards a genre/book/author and the people who read them. </p>\n\n<p>I guess the moral here is to please try to understand that books are for everyone, it&#39;s not your place or authority to decide who is a &quot;fan&quot; or not. Just try to be less judgemental. But not just for books, for everything. Movies, games, food, careers, hobbies, fashion, etc. It doesn&#39;t hurt you if a 35yo is using this Reddit and all they read is dystopian YA. I promise you&#39;ll sleep better at night not worrying about these kinds of things.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m pasting this response to a comment I received. It&#39;s in regards to my motivation to making this post and I think it&#39;s relevant. I wish I had included this in the post to begin with</p>\n\n<p>As far as saying it&#39;s &quot;my issue&quot;, I get what you&#39;re saying, but that&#39;s not why I made the post. My overall moral of the post of not being judgemental (not limited to books) is one I think is important. Because people hating that I like a certain book or movie or whatever? I couldn&#39;t care less. But gatekeeping mentalities do make their way into power. Whether it&#39;s political or a workplace or even a Reddit community. And it&#39;s on those places where voices are silenced and people are hurt in very real ways. Encouraging people to be more open minded is something worth investing in, imo of course. </p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t live for other people. I couldn&#39;t give less of a f*** what people think of how I dress, eat, live, read, game, etc. I do me, very unabashedly might I add. The reasons above are why I made the post. Not because I let myself be pushed and pulled by other&#39;s onions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
