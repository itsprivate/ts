I recently lent my favourite book to a friend. This book was first published in 1940s and belonged to my great grandmother who gave to my grandmother, who in turn passed it on to me.

They tried to erase some scribbles but didn&#39;t do a good job of it and left creases on the pages. Maybe I&#39;m overreacting but I have always been explicitly clear that if I lend you a book, I expect it to be given back in the same condition I gave it in.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
