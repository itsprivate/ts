This was easily my best read of the year so far, and is instantly a favorite of mine.\n\n[Spoiler-FREE thoughts]\n\nThis book feels like all of the best parts of an epic fantasy series, except a standalone. It’s huge, just over 800 pages, but it doesn’t feel bloated. Every scene was engaging to me, and even though it’s somewhat slowly paced, it never dragged on like many other large fantasy books do at some points (looking at you, Rhythm of War).\n\nThe characters are brilliant. Ead is a wonderful ‘main-ish’ protagonist and one of my new favorites, and the the supporting characters are all amazing in their own rights as well. The friendships are heartwarming, the romance is both compelling and adorable, and every character/relationship gets their time in the spotlight. \n\nI’ve heard people say that this book is boring, and I can *sort of* see why, but I vehemently disagree. It’s definitely not action packed, but the politics, intrigue, and character moments were more than enough to drive the story for me. The action that was there was great, and there are some incredibly badass moments throughout the story.\n\nThis book doesn’t really feel like modern fantasy - it feels like a very refined take on classic fantasy that incorporates some great elements of modern fantasy. The end product is delightful, and I can’t recommend it highly enough.\n\nIf you really like a great, fleshed-out villain, you’ll probably be disappointed. This book is mostly focused on the protagonists and their stories. \n\nHowever, if that’s not a problem for you, I can’t recommend this book highly enough :)",
