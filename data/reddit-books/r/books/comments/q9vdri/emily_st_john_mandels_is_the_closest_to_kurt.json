In other books I always find the introduction of new characters halfway through the story tedious, since I&#39;m already emotionally invested with the prior characters and want to continue their story - but in Mandel&#39;s books every single character she introduces, even if barely have anything to do with the plot, is just instantly relatable. Within a few sentences she creates realistic human beings that you instantly care about.</p>\n\n<p>Did anyone here read her early novels? Are they equally good?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
