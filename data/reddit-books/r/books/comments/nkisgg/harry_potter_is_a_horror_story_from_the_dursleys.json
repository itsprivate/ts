I began to think of how strange he must have looked speaking this language to the people around them. Then I realized that he seems to switch between parseltounge and English without conscious thought. This is evident in the dualing scene with Draco in the second book.\nThis would paint the Dursleys in a slightly more sympathetic light, not by much but at least a little. While I would never treat a child that way I can see how it might be concerning if not out right concerning. Imagine you were at a family function and your adopted son started speaking in tounges, in this case hissing like a black metal singer, and stuff starts exploding. This would be horrifying and written with a different tone and a change of narrator we could have something straight out of a horror movie.\nNow imagine you are the Dursleys and your adopted nephew is walking around hissing and blowing shit up with his mind. You hadn't talked to your relatives for years and now you are in charge of their son. He shows up on your doorstep in the middle of the night one night along with a letter that literally screams at you. This is all before you even know your relative is dead. You raise this child of your estranged relative reluctantly. As he gets older it becomes apparent that when he is upset that your nephew is capable of things that defy explanation of natural law. You have no idea what these powers are capable of or how dangerous to you, or your child, they are.\nThis all makes the Dursleys dislike of Harry Potter a little more sympathetic, at least to me.\nTL;DR: Harry Potter is a Horror Movie from the Dursleys perspective.",
