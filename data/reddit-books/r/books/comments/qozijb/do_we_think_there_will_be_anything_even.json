The closest I can think of would be the mid 2010’s Game of Thrones phenomena, which was due in large part to the very successful HBO show. </p>\n\n<p>I know that the world was pretty ripe for those series in that time frame, and it was a combination of luck, the right audience, and a sense of “you just had to be there”, but it just really seems that anything else since has almost missed the mark. I mean, HP basically created the YA genre as we know it. I understand that we usually get at least one big series with an almost cult like following at least once a decade, but what’s going on? Was it just chance that so many books became that huge within one decade? </p>\n\n<p>Some people will say that kids don’t read as much anymore but I don’t buy that. Give them something amazing, on point, engaging and kids WILL read it. </p>\n\n<p>Am I just reminiscing about days gone by, caught up in my own nostalgia? Was it really the end of an era after 2012? Will anything ever have that much hype again? Be a household name? Have adults and teens and kids alike awaiting the next release? I really miss those times, to be honest. Again the closest thing was GOT but after the disastrous ending of S8, and GRRM probably dying before releasing book 6, nothing has really come across my radar as having even anywhere near that amount of traction. There are some dedicated fan bases for others series out there, but nothing like what we saw.  I think if there was a series of that caliber, we’d know. </p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
