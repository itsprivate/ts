Any book or series for me will have to be completed before I begin. I just can&#39;t have so many incomplete stories (kingkiller, gentlemen bastards, asoiaf,) and be left with the cliff hangers. Or am I wrong and hurting new authors for having their first book in a series be ignored because its only the beginning?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
