The main character is a catholic priest and the book is riddled with thought provoking and hilarious confessions. \n\nPs I’m sure that there are other great novels told in reverse order but this was the first of the kind I have read. Beautifully executed! And meant to be read twice I would say. 10/10 just go read it! I hope you enjoy (:",
