I just don&#39;t find enjoyment reading fast because I can&#39;t picture the scene in my head right or get the faces and expressions right in my head. I want to see everything and get the details. - though I hear people tell me that they want the exact same thing but they can still read fast. I just don&#39;t get it. What is this superpower you all have? Or maybe it is a superpower I have because the majority do read fast. Pretty useless power then ngl... whish i could read faster... </p>\n\n<p>An example is that I see these tiktokers and they read 27 (or even more maybe 30 idk) books in a month!! I can only read like 2? In a month? My reading challenge on goodreads is 15. But like everyone else have 100 or more. </p>\n\n<p>It is kinda sad because I feel like I will never catch up and it&#39;s hard to relate to others in the book community and I&#39;m scared of connecting to other book lovers because they will just view me as a slow turtle compared to them and we will never be able to buddy read cause it will take days for me while it will only take like idk 3 hours for them to finish a book...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
