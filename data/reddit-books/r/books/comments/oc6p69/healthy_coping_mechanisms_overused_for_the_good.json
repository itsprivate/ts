The section in the book involved the character pushing herself super hard as her way of dealing with all the shitty stuff going on (this book was set during WWII). I see this all the time in books and movies and it frustrates the hell out of me. Why is it that good characters always seem to use healthy coping mechanisms?Bombs are dropping everywhere and millions of people are dying and there’s not enough food, yet this character still somehow has enough physical and mental energy to get up early  and push super hard exercising? Everyone else is turning to alcohol or sex or cigarettes but not the main character. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t think this would bother me as much if it didn’t come up so frequently in books. Has anyone else noticed this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
