  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My pops died in a motorcycle wreck about fifteen years ago. He was my best friend, and I get my love of all things sci-fi and fantasy from him. The year or so before he died, I remember him getting a new book series from a work buddy. It was WoT. He devoured it. He would miss his sleep schedule (he was a shift worker) reading WoT. In fact, he was so consumed by it he quit playing World of Warcraft for months (fifteen years ago, you can imagine how serious that was). But he never got to finish.</p>\n\n<p>I still have his copies. You can tell where he finished from the tinge of tobacco stain where he would chain smoke Marlboros while he read in bed (it was a different time). I haven&#39;t had the heart to read them. Not sure if it was from fear of disappointment or avoiding old memories, but I finally picked up Eye of the World and started reading it to get ready for the series to come out.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, it&#39;s the fastest I&#39;ve ever finished a book of that size--even as an avid epic fantasy reader. When I finished Eye of the World last night, I wanted to cry. I wish I could share the joy this book gave me with my dad. I already know his response would have been &quot;it FUCKING ROCKS&quot; because that was just his way. But I&#39;m happy to share a piece of that smirk he always had wrapped around his cigarette while he read these. I have a feeling it&#39;s only going to get better from here.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s to you, dad.</p>\n\n<p>“The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.”</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr Finally read my dad&#39;s wheel of time books fifteen years after he passed. The experience is something I will cherish forever.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
