I hopped an Amtrak train and settled in to read. I tend to re-read my favorites often. One of my top favorite authors is a bit obscure but a staple of NYC culture. He writes fiction loosely based on some of his experiences based upon growing up in the city. As the train rattled south, I started to contemplate stopping at New York City for a few hours to get lunch and site see. \n\n\nI looked down at my book and thought how neat it would be to run into my author. Then my wheels turned. I picked up my phone and started searching for a public profile on social media. I finally found one, sent him a message about being a fan and if he was out and about if he would sign my book. It was a wild shot in the dark, and I figure it would go unanswered.\n\n\nTwo hours later, we pulled into Penn Station and I got off to go grab some lunch and maybe shop when my phone dinged. It was him. \n\n\nHe had written me back and agreed to sign my book. I couldn’t believe it. I said I’d meet him at a famous book store called the Strand  in the East Village to make it easy on him. I quickly hopped a cab to the book store and waited like a nervous teenager. Anyone that is a book nerd must go to the Strand once in their life. \n\n\nI recognized him immediately as he approached me. He asked if I wanted to get a burger and chat and he would happily sign it. Absolutely! \n\n\nWe walked to a burger place, all while stopping to show me places that were important in his books, or that held significance. We ate and chatted. We walked for a few hours afterwards as he graciously gave me a tour detailing the visions of his books until it started to rain. We popped into a pizza shop- he graciously signed my books, gave me his shirt, took a picture with me and got me in a cab back to Penn Station before the last train. \n\n\nThe lesson of the day was wonderful- I learned as much as I appreciated his writings, he appreciated how much I valued wanting to truly hear the origins and birth of it all. I promised to return to NY this year and return his shirt- and in his latest book released last year- my name is included in the forward thank you list of people — as a thank you for the burger.",
