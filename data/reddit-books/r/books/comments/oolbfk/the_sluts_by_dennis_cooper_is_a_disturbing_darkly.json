  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It is shocking to see a book that captures an experience that comes in so many different forms so perfectly in its fictional and often extreme account, but <em>The Sluts</em> manages that feat.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve been an active member in various online forums and communities since I was <em>seven</em>. Is that a terrible idea? Abso-fucking-lutely. I saw shit a child should not have seen. Someone posted Goatse to my innocent little cartoon chat box and some deep-rooted instinct must have protected me then, because for years all I thought that photo was was a man with &quot;lips&quot; on his butt. I have been a friend, a sexual partner, an asshole, and the worst nightmare of people who had no idea who I really was at all, let alone how old I was.</p>\n\n<p>As such, once I found out the premise and layout of <em>The Sluts</em> by Dennis Cooper, I was very intrigued as to reading the book for myself. I ended up finishing it in two sittings of an hour or two on the same day, a rare occurrence for me since I got my own Internet-connected devices to have in my possession 24/7  around the age of 12 and lost my remaining attention span <del>and sanity</del> with it.</p>\n\n<p>The basic story is about a message board for reviewing gay male escorts, and how one review for a young trick named Brad and the promise of &quot;unbelievable&quot; sex is enough to spark a chain of lurid, bizarre, and sometimes fatal events that are discussed, challenged, and theorized about. The majority of the story is written in the format of messages that are being exchanged by users of this message board.</p>\n\n<p>There are points where the stories of this teenage escort from people who claim to have encountered him and the Internet perverts from the sidelines really start to blur together and can easily confuse the reader. Looking over the book again as I read this, I&#39;m reminded of characters from the beginning that I can&#39;t pinpoint the fates of from reading it through. There are several unreliable narrators that we get to know - it may be frustrating for some readers, but I see it as a perfect representation of the Internet. Even if you haven&#39;t experienced it first hand, it takes is to go deep into some infamous Reddit stories/memes to learn that people on the Internet are liars, liars who can change their identity in a second and craft entire worlds that wouldn&#39;t make any sense to an outsider.</p>\n\n<p>If it sounds like a read that may be depressing or difficult, I can assure you that it&#39;s not. I think the different stories that the narrators give from the beginning about &quot;Brad&quot; made me realize that a mystery of sorts was unfolding, and my drive to uncover it was greater than any confusion. There is also some dark comedy in the story, including a guy who sets up a separate group entirely to focus on the sexual fantasy of killing Nick Carter, and his disappointment in the original group&#39;s hesitation to join him. </p>\n\n<p>(I originally took this as a &quot;the Internet is crazy lmao&quot; type of detail, but then realized that the Kill Nick Carter character could easily be seen as the story&#39;s separation of individuals with private, perverse sexual kinks and the real murderers and rapists - though behind a screen, who ever knows for sure which one you&#39;re dealing with?)</p>\n\n<p>Overall, <em>The Sluts</em> is one of the rawest and most authentic looks at the beast of the Internet that&#39;s come up in the past two decades. A world where people across the globe who would never have otherwise become connected find one another - a world they can drop in and out of and become whoever they want. This power - much like every other power I can think of - is a force of some of the greatest goods and the most heinous acts in the world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
