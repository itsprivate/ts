Walter Isaacson, the master biographer, brilliantly  shows us the life of a genius, whose interests ranged from planetary motion to as eccentric as \"analysis of a woodpecker's tongue\". You read that right. One cannot help but marvel at the genius of Leonardo and appreciate the calibre of his mind! Had he published his works, he would have deservingly been credited with the discovery of friction, Bernoulli's laws, Newton's third law, functioning of the aortic valve and the scientific method. He was centuries ahead of his time and his fascinating notebooks are filled with beautiful drawings of anatomy, which have been explained in a simple manner by Walter Isaacson. Science aside, I don't think I need to mention his world famous paintings like Mona lisa, the last supper and my favourite, Saint John the Baptist. He was as much as an artist as a scientist and had a intense curiosity about everything in the world. \n\nHere are  some key ideas I learned from the book which I'm surely going to implement in my own life:\n\n\t1)\tBe curious. Be relentlessly curious about everything. It can be as vague as  \"inspecting the tongue of a woodpecker\" and as serious as understanding the way light from the sun reaches the planets\". Just have a relentless  and a random curiosity about everything life has to offer and be a seeker of knowledge.\n\t\n2)\tSeek knowledge not to make a profit or boast, but for its own sake. Seek knowledge to appreciate and enjoy life. \"Not all knowledge has to be useful. Sometimes it can for pure pleasure\".\n\n\t3)\t Retain  a child-like sense of wonder. Don a mask of simplicity and like a child, look at the world as a canvas full of colours and scenes to be drawn upon.\n\n\t4)\tAlways wonder about why things are the way they are. We may appreciate the blue sky, but we never reflect on why the sky is blue. Leonardo did. And so did Einstein.\n\n\t5)\tObserve! Observe everything and enjoy movement, silence and flow of nature around you.\n\t\n6)\tGo down rabbit holes that amaze you.\n\t\n7)\tBe fearless about changing your opinions as you gather new insights and let go of your past knowledge if new facts disapprove it.\n\n\t8)\tBe a perfectionist. Don't settle for  \"good enough\".  Delay projects if you feel they are not perfect. Leonardo carried Mona Lisa and Adoration of the Magi with him even during his final moments, always ready for a new stroke of the brush. Likewise, Steve jobs made sure the circuit boards of the first Macintosh looked beautiful, even though nobody was going to see them. \"Real artists care about the beauty of the parts unseen\".\n\n\t9) Create not only for others and for profit, but for your personal joy.\n\t\n10) Collaborate. One man can never surpass what 100 men can do together. Singular vision may be important, but execution is often best with a team.\n\n\t11)\tTake notes about things that inspire you\n\n\t12)\tBe open to mysteries. Not everything needs sharp lines and well definitions. Had that been the case, the beautiful Sfumato so vivid in Mona Lisa would never exist ( The renowned \"seductive\" smile of Mona Lisa is accomplished through a Leonardo special technique called Sfumato)\n\nThat's it. I hope you guys found this valuable. Have a good day:))",
