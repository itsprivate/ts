By the time she&#39;s in bed, my eyes and brain itch for sleep. Even when she did nap for a couple of blessed years, I&#39;d prefer to spend that time either doing chores or resting, too exhausted to focus on a book. When I did try, my weary mind would wander no matter how much I enjoyed the book, my eyes struggling to focus.</p>\n\n<p>Then, a couple of months ago, I got some Bluetooth earbuds and decided to pick up audiobooks. I downloaded the Harry Potter series as a venture into audiobooks as they are familiar to me. I&#39;m now on The Deathly Hallows, and I feel like I&#39;ve absorbed more through this manner than reading them traditionally. I listen when Im doing dishes, cooking dinner, driving in the car, weeding, or any other chore that doesn&#39;t require much deep thought. It feels like a sweet man, Stephen Fry, is sitting and reading the books to me, like I do for my own daughter. The events at the end of Half-Blood Prince (that I&#39;m being vague about to avoid spoilers) hit me harder than they ever did when I read them as a teenager, which I never would have expected.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just so elated to be able to &quot;read&quot; again, no matter how much my eyes atrophy or how busy I feel. I cannot recommend it more, especially for those dejected about the lack of time to do anything enjoyable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
