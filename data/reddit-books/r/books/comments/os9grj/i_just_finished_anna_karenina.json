I have witnessed some of the most real characters, in both their complexity and human predictability, to ever stem from a mind. I almost feel as though I have truly lived a life during my reading; I have experienced so much that has made me ponder, smile with glee, cry with sorrow, and simply feel satisfied with how easily I can understand the various characters (I could relate to each in their own way!), their struggles, and their place in society even though it was written so long ago—Tolstoy was a genius, a genius that could make you question and realize and think and feel more than you would be able to without his mind. None of his characters were without some unique insight into the spirit of the universe, the world, philosphy, psychology, Russian society, or the soul; and because all—at least the main characters—have pulled me alongside such a profound journey, a lasting impression of them on me is undoubtedly imbued inside my core, and will always be there. It’s also the perfect social commentary, and I can say with certainty that I understand the human condition to a greater extent than I ever have. Really, my life has been entrenched with such a new richness during the course of my reading—I cannot help but think that I have already reached my peak!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
