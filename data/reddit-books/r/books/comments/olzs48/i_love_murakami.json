By this I mean how easy they are to read yet it&#39;s not lacking substance. His prose is so simply elegant.</p>\n\n<p>Now concerning his portrayal of Female characters, I oddly find his female characters to be apart of that &#39;magical realism&#39; realm. Just like his male characters, are his female characters also that remarkable and distinguishable from each other? I&#39;d argue no. All his female characters are eccentric and so far removed from what you would consider a &#39;real&#39; woman that I interpret it as an artistic decision. Of course, I could be reaching there.</p>\n\n<p>So what are other people&#39;s thoughts? I&#39;m really interested to hear them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
