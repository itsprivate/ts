I&#39;ve always heard the phrase &#39;representation matters&#39;, but I never applied it to myself because it was &quot;meant for books for kids&quot; and I &quot;didn&#39;t need it.&quot; Turns out, I did. I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder a couple of years ago and it was devastating. Not for Prince Mushkin, though -- he just floats his way through life with a childlike sense of kindness and wonder <em>because</em> of his &#39;fits.&#39; </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m only about 1/4 of the way through the book right now so please no spoilers! This is my 3rd Dostoevsky novel and I love his beautiful and chaotic prose and storytelling. This is also the second of his books with a character with seizures (The Brothers Karamazov is the other). I didn&#39;t consciously realize it at the time but that character meant a lot to me too. What I went through wasn&#39;t a joke. Now I have a book that respects that. And now I understand how important it is -- for everyone, including adults -- for books to have characters that reach us for <em>every</em> part of ourselves. Thank you all for reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
