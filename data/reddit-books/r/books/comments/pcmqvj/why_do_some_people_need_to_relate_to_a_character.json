There are times when ive read books where i cant relate to any of the characters but the characters (whilst completely crazy and the opposite of me) are fascinating. Sometimes the draw for the book isnt necessarily the characters themselves but a more broader picture of how all the different pieces in the plot come together.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly think those who only look for &#39;likeable&#39; characters or characters they can relate to are narrowing their selection and missing out on a lot of great books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
