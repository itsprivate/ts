I cannot edit the title of the post, but it’s been pointed out that the title looks like a request while obviously the post is a recommendation. For a whole sub dedicated to people that read, lots don’t even make it past the headline. </p>\n\n<p>This sub has gotten plenty of love from Houssenis three books (and rightfully so, they are incredible), but I read “Fort of Nine Towers” many years ago to understand the Taliban rise to power in Afghanistan and was completely blown away. </p>\n\n<p>I am struggling deeply with what’s been unfolding for the last few months and have been driven back to this powerful autobiography. It is a first hand account of living through the absolute chaos and pain of the Taliban rise to power and what we can anticipate happens right now as they reclaim Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>I do not want this post to become political or a mud slinging campaign against the Afghan Army or people. Merely, my somber recommendation to pick up this book by Qais Akbar Omar and get ready for a powerful ride.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
