I wanted to share some of my favorites that I’ve been listening to and hear about your favorites too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marlon and Jake Read Dead People</strong>—The booker prize award winning author Marlon James and his editor run this podcast. The second season started this week! They discuss classic books and have really engaging discussion and banter. If you’re a fan of literary fiction or classics check this out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Top Shelf Reads</strong>—This is a newer podcast that does a great job of balancing book reviews and discussion topics about various reading topics. They introduced me to A Fine Balance, which I’m currently enjoying! Their episodes feel varied—not just recommendation after recommendation. Very impressed so far. They seem to focus on lit fiction, historical fiction, sci-fi/fantasy, weird fiction, and some narrative non fiction and philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bookshop Interview</strong>—This is a fun podcast to hear interviews from lesser known authors. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve heard so far. If you want insight on the writing process from authors, check it out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Literary Friction</strong>—Another podcast geared towards literary fiction but they do a great job of not making it a “thing”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Book Review (NYT)</strong>—A professional podcast that I listen to when they cover a book I am interested in. The Hamnet episode was great!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Book Riot</strong>—another professional show that has great hosts covering publishing and book news. Love their inclusive/progressive focus.</p>\n\n<p>Have you listened to any of these? What do you think? Did I leave off your favorite?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
