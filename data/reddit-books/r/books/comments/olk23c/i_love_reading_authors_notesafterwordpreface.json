Poor guy spent over nine years on this book, but he has good humor about it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>to quote Rolfe Humphries from the foreword to his translation of <em>The Aeneid:</em> [...] &quot;Virgil, one can well believe, having worked on the poem for over a decade, had reached the point where he felt he would rather do anything, including die, than go over the poem one more time&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paolini knows the book is <em>&#39;eh&#39;</em>, but he did it! He finished it! I got so invested when reading his note and I was rooting so hard for him to get the book published that by the end, I was smiling like and mad man and telling my family about his great accomplishment. It really changed my disposition, and I&#39;m excited to see what Paolini comes out with next!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>However, the top spot for my favorite notes goes to Niel Gaiman. Sometimes I find myself looking forward to reading those a bit more than the book itself. In <em>Good Omens</em> Gaiman and Pratchett have some funny banter. My personal favorite:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agnes Nutter scenes and the kids mostly originated with Terry, the Four Horsemen and anything that involved maggots started with Neil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What are some author&#39;s notes that you particularly like?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
