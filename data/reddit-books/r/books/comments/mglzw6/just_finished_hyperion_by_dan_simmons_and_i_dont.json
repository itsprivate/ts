The private investigator’s story was okay and the poets story I thought was kinda lame. So essentially, half of the book was amazing and the other half I rolled my eyes at the 15 sex scenes throughout. I mean, I don’t mind sex in books but it was a little much and not very well written in my opinion. But the ENDING made me mad. Holding hands and singing the freaking Wizard of Oz... are you kidding me dude. I don’t know, it felt so cheesy to me and I felt like I wasted my time. \n\nSo after I dealt with my emotions on the ending of this book, I look up reviews for the book and literally everyone is loving it. I seemed to be the only one who didn’t think it was the bee’s knees. It wasn’t the worst book I’ve ever read but it certainly wasn’t a 10/10. \n\nHow did you guys feel about Hyperion?",
