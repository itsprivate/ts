I would read at all times of the day. Eventually, I got into PC gaming, and less time was spent reading. I would much rather turn on The Sims or League of Legends than pick up a book. This went on for years, and I am sad I let it get as bad as it did. Well, recently my PC broke, and I don’t have the funds to fix it (thanks bitcoin miners) so I decided to read some of the books I had planned on reading, but never got around to. Such as “The Help” and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. I got hooked immediately, and finished a decent-sized book in 2 days, whereas before it would have taken me two months and not even a guarantee I’d finish it. I have felt much better with myself and began to feel fulfilled after I would finish a book. Especially after “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” I love expanding my knowledge, outlook on others' world views, how history changed over time and now I also have a new favourite book. At first, I was a little skeptical about reading it, as I hadn’t read many books in a while and it was written in a period in which the language was a little different but I am sure glad I did and I can now see why it is referred to as a classic novel. I would recommend it to anyone, and everyone I meet. That book made me cry, laugh and smile all at the same time. I am surprisingly glad my pc broke, making me read Huckleberry Finn and reminding me of my love for books and writing. Has anyone else had a similar situation? What rekindled your love for reading?",
