There's one book that's brought it back into my mind: I've recently been completely engrossed in re-reading Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire, which does have a lot of cross-referencing/jumping-around, and does require the reader to take some sort of active role in \"solving\" the story. It's not quite the same thing, but it brought these CYOA books back into my mind and got me wondering what the potential for this kind of \"interactive\" literature is. \n\nHas anyone read serious/literary novels that also have something like this? What do you think of it as a device, or of making the reader do some \"work\" in general? Does taking it to its logical extreme essentially turn a book into a really low tech RPG video game? Are there other things you can do as an author to make the reader a really active participant - I was thinking of the sorts of murder mysteries, where part of the enjoyment is trying (and probably failing) to beat the fictional detective to the elegant solution. \n\nJust curious.",
