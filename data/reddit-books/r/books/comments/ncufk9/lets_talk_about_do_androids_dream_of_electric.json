Empathy, evidently, existed only within the human community, whereas intelligence to some degree could be found through every phylum and order including the arachnida.\n\nI finally got around to reading *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* and realized it is actually set in January 2021, so it seemed fitting to be reading it in 2021. I have attempted to read it before, but it didn't quite grab me last time around. \n\nThe central idea behind the book is that \"androids don't feel empathy and that makes them different from humans.\" An android would sell out an other android without a second thought according to the some of the characters. What makes humans \"humans\"? Is it the ability to feel for each other? The idea that we can form groups and we are invested in other members of our group. It makes sense that that is what is considered to make us human, but PKD does make me question that throughout the book.\n\nDeckard is very much a loner, he doesn't quite seem to like other people, he doesn't even seem to particularly like his wife, and he doesn't really seem to have a connection beyond a professional one with any of the people he works with. Now it is very possible that he is shunned because he is a bounty hunter, but Holden seems to enjoy a level of respect in the department. The idea of group and a connection between people is mostly represented by Mercerism, yet Deckard seems reluctant to connect to that experience on a regular basis. When he undertakes \"the climb\" himself, he does so alone. The only time he appears to (try to) make an emotional connection it is with Rachael. \n\nFurthermore, the way Isidore is treated by other humans doesn't necessarily show empathy towards him. He is called a chickenhead by his boss and by Deckard. As a special he appears to have been placed outside of \"normal\" society and he is also a loner, to an even more extreme degree than Deckard. He even lives in an entire apartment building by himself. \n\nThe escaped andys on the other hand seem to stick together as a group and rely on each other to a certain degree. The Batys stick together and Roy seems to respond to Irmgard's death. Luba Luft calls other androids to help her when she is close to being caught and she actually receives that help, even though it makes the connections between the different andys visible. It would seem to me that the chance of not being found would increase if they didn't stick together, so splitting up would be a logical choice. While the argument can be made that they will have a greater success overcoming a bounty hunter together, it also makes it easier for a bounty hunter to find them. \n\nMost of the lack of empathy androids are supposed to have is related to the care of animals. PKD did include some pretty clear examples of androids not being able to relate to the suffering of animals: Priss cutting the legs of the spider, Rachael throwing the goat off the roof. Which also extends to the fact that the androids killed humans to escape Mars and flee to Earth. Then again, none of those behaviors would, unfortunately, be all that strange for members of the human race to display. So is empathy truly what makes humans unique, if there are also humans that lack empathy?\n\nI guess that is what I liked most about the book, PKD gets you to think about these things without really focusing on them overtly. The concept of Mercerism is very interesting, especially because I don't think the fact that it was \"fake\" is going to change anything for its followers. And that is also a bit frustrating about the book. I wish PKD would have expanded a bit more on Mercerism, and the discovering that it was \"fake\", and also on the fake police station. It probably would have interrupted the flow of the book itself, but there are some other ideas in it that would have been interesting to explore. \n\nI now have to rewatch the movie, even though it is quite different from the book.",
