Honestly, every year older my daughter has gotten has just been more and more enjoyable, especially now that she's excited about reading for herself. \n\n\nShe's seven now, and she reads on her own pretty constantly, but we still have the ritual of reading books before bed. I loved this ritual when it was board books with words she didn't understand, I loved it when they were rhyming books that she would memorize and recite with me, and I loved it when they were longer picture books, especially books I remembered from my own childhood. But in the last couple of years we've started reading chapter books, and I'm getting to share with her some of my FAVORITE stories, and it's the most incredible experience.\n\n\nWe read the first few Harry Potter books 3 times, because she always wanted to start again when we were finished. Each time she convinced me to read a couple books farther, until this year when we finally finished the series. I know there's a lot of content that she can't fully comprehend, but just sharing the story with her and seeing her get so into it (she was Hermione for Halloween 2 years in a row) is amazing. We've also read Ella Enchanted twice, one of my all-time favorite books from when I was a kid, and when we finished it the last time she said \"That is my FAVORITE book!\" \n\n\nThe books I'm reading with her were such a big part of my life, for years and years before she was even born. When we read them together it feels like we're creating a special bond that is separate from other parts of our mother-daughter relationship. It feels like she's getting to meet the 11 year-old-me who originally read and fell in love with that story, and it's indescribably cool.",
