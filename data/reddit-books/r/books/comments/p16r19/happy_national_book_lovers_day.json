There are few joys as a parents that top the feeling as catching your child read on their own and watch their awe and happiness as they turn the pages. I remember the excitement of opening &#39;the Hobbit&#39; the first time and diving into a world of fantasy and wonder, or reading Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s &#39;3 Investigators&#39;, reading books on the bus to school and to games, reading on the plane on my first big adventure to Yellowstone, finding belonging over a lunch table at college talking about our favorite writers, the comfort books provided as I served in the Peace Corps, how they make the commute disappear as I go to and from work, how they challenge how I think and make me more compassionate, understanding, and open. Today is National Book Lover&#39;s Day and I will celebrate by reading (as I do everyday) but on this day I will be especially grateful for all of those who put their pens to paper, fingers to keys, and minds to create, explore, and expand and to those in the industry that make them available to my home and life and my parents who have given me the gateway to 1000s of lifetimes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
