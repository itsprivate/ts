Maybe I’m crazy, but I have to think there’s more people out there who remember this series… right? Just hear my melodramatic self out.\n\nSo, these books were released throughout the entirety of the 2000s. They were up there with A to Z Mysteries, Bailey School Kids, and Magic Treehouse, at least at my library. Except this was straight-up fantasy, trying to rival the likes of Harry Potter but even younger target demographics.\n\nYou followed the standard 3 kid protagonists (Eric, Julie, Neal) as they accidentally stumble into an entire fantasy-based alternate reality through Eric’s basement. And then later on they get changed/corrupted/cursed over the long-term series in a weird choice of actual continuity for a children’s book series. I don’t think it ever went as dark as Animorphs, because who could, but it was closer than most. But there was a steady progression of plot and some weird twists judging by the short Wikipedia synopsis and my own scattered memories. Hella time manipulation, shapeshifters, wizards,  sorcerers, genies, dragons, evil selves, pillow people… I give up, there’s too much and half of it wouldn’t make sense out of context to list because, you know, fantasy.\n\nIt’s a bit of a fever dream to be honest. \n\nAnd the more I try to look into the series, the stranger it gets. Virtually every single book in the series has a 4/5 on goodreads; perhaps that’s normal, but I find it eerie. There’s a subreddit for the book series… with only 1 post. Ever. [And it seems to echo my sentiments here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/droon/comments/jb8i4c/anyone_else_feel_like_secrets_of_droon_was_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) There’s also only one thread on r/books when I search the title. The fanbase is nonexistent. If I didn’t know better, I’d say someone is purposely shoving Secrets of Droon into obscurity.\n\nSo, why am I making this post? I don’t know. It’s kinda cathartic I guess. I just want to know if anyone ever thinks about this series, remembers anything, perhaps a reason why it’s remembered the way it is (which is it’s not). Maybe I should just reread it myself. \n\nRegardless, thanks.",
