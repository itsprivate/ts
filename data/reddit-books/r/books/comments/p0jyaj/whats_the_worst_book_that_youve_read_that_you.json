It’s poorly written, characters are introduced and built up only to completely disappear later on, a major new story thread is started out of nowhere in the last quarter of the book, it’s politics are extremely suspect and the dialogue is like the author has never spoken to a real life person before. It’s terrible but also it made me laugh out loud more than once and I’ve recommended it (with qualifications) to everyone I know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
