Too many books, too little time to be wasted on something that doesn't grab you, etc. But, having just finished a book that I didn't like—I'm not going to name names, but the author and the book are both well-loved by a lot of other folks—I've been thinking about the arguments in favor of reading, at least some of the time, books that are not to your taste. Here's what I've come up with:\n\n1. Reading outside your comfort zone (or even pleasure zone) allows you to participate in more conversations. The author I just now didn't enjoy is an author that people talk about a lot. I may not get pleasure in that author's work—I think I can say that, at least provisionally, after having read seven of their books—but I do get pleasure in being able to participate meaningfully in conversations where that author's work comes up.\n2. Staying with something forces you to deal with it. It forces you to see what little pleasures might be there be beyond what first strikes you; it forces you to become a more thoughtful and active reader. Which puts you in a position to get even more out of the books you do like.\n3. Confronting what you don't like also forces you to think about and maybe articulate *why* certain things please you and others don't; it refines your taste.\n4. It's also worth noting that tastes change. And maybe a book you don't like at first can be part of the force that changes those tastes. Maybe you do leave the book dissatisfied but also a little more ready to like another book that's a sort of compromise between what you just read and what you usually read. Maybe that book can begin to broaden you.\n\nAs I say, for the most part I believe in reading what you want to read, and I have tossed aside a good number of books partway through because they just didn't feel worth it. I'm going to keep doing that. Life is short, etc. But sometimes—every once in a while—I'm going to push myself to read all the way to the last page of something that just doesn't work for me. And I'm going to be glad I did.\n\nThoughts?",
