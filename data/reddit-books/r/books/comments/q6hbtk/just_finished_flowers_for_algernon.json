I don&#39;t know why I put myself trough it because I was feeling so bad for Charlie throughout the entire novel. It breaks me, the way he’s been treated by everyone especially himself is the most depressing shit ever put down on a page.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t recommend this book to anyone since it&#39;s literally the worst reading experience of my life, this story is so cruel on such a fundamental level and seeing how Charlie descends into madness and the way he pushes out Alice in the end and how he never got to get anything more than a conversation with Norma. How this person who got so little in life could get even less, it breaks my heart.</p>\n\n<p>PS. Please if you get a chanse put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
