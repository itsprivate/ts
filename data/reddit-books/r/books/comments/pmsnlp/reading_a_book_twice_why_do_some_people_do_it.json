Everyone is different and has a different approach to reading. Once I&#39;ve read a book, I know what&#39;s in it. I know the story, or, if it&#39;s a non-fiction title, I remember the most important facts. Reading a book can take anywhere between 20-50 hours, and I would rather use what little time I have in general to work through more titles on my to-read list. I find it even more baffling when people claim to have read a book multiple times. I understand that we are all different, but don&#39;t you remember enough after a read or two? I&#39;ve seen people compare it to listening to your favorite songs on loop, but it&#39;s not the same, is it? A song is 3-5 minutes. I can listen to a song several times in an hour. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a criticism of people who read the same books multiple times. I&#39;m just curious to understand why they do it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
