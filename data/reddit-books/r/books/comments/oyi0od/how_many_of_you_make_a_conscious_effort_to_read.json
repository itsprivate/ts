Interestingly, I&#39;ve experienced almost no reader&#39;s burnout this year and I think that&#39;s in large part because of the diverse range of voices and stories I&#39;ve had the pleasure of experiencing.</p>\n\n<p>At the same, I&#39;ve also just had a three-book streak of books by white male authors and I feel strangely and irrationally guilty about it. Am I overthinking all this? Shouldn&#39;t I just read what sounds interesting rather than worrying about who wrote it?</p>\n\n<p>What do you folks think? Do you try to vary who you read based on their gender/sexuality/ethnicity or other factors? Does this have a bearing on your reading experience?</p>\n\n<p>**EDIT:**</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your insightful responses!</p>\n\n<p>Just as a disclaimer - I&#39;m not trying to be controversial with this post. Nor do I believe any author is a better or worse writer, or worth reading any more or less based on race, gender or whatever else.</p>\n\n<p>I definitely agree with a lot of your comments, and I&#39;d like to share my personal takeaways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Trying to read diversely can be fulfilling, enlightening, entertaining and can lead to your stumbling on works you may never have considered before, but end up loving.</li>\n<li>But reading in general is a wholly personal endeavor and you should read whomever and whatever most interests you most, regardless of external factors. Just read, damn it!</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
