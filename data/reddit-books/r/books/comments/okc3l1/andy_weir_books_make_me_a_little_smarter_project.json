  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I absolutely loved <em>The Martian</em> and was really excited when I saw a new novel, <em>Project Hail Mary</em>, by Andy Weir. I love the way he takes time to explain complex solutions to problems, aspects of orbital mechanics, and even just basic conversions for everyday units of measure; and make it fun! I feel like his books make me a little bit smarter.\n<em>Project Hail Mary</em> had me hooked from the start, and I really enjoyed such a unique and multifaceted storyline. If you liked Mark Watney for his personality, I believe you’ll find Ryland Grace to be of a very similar disposition and attitude. Sounds like Ryan Gosling will be playing Grace in a movie adaptation, which is exciting.\nSome elements of the novel had me wanting go back and rewatch “Arrival” which then led me to Ted Chiang books. So far those are incredible works of sci-Fi short stories.\nI also just discovered <em>Artemis</em> by Weir which was published between Martian and Hail Mary, so I’ll be tackling that one next.</p>\n\n<p>What other authors or individual novels have you read, that you feel made you a little bit smarter?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
