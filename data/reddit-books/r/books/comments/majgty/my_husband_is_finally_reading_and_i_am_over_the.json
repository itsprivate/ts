He's really smart and has no qualms with reading other than not having enough down time in which to do so. Each time I finish a really good book, all I want to do is talk to him about it, but can never bring myself to do so as I feel like I'm spoiling things for him, even though I know it's not likely that he'll ever read whatever book is in question. \n\nLast year I found an audiobook of The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel on YouTube and decided to give it a go. Hubby listened to the whole thing with me and even seemed to enjoy it, even though he's more of a sci-fi/fantasy person. I'm not much one for audiobooks and personally more of a fan of physical copies, so it was the first experience of it's kind that we'd had together. \n\nThen one of my favorite books got adapted to a TV series. It's called A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness; my husband found a used copy at our local thrift shop and bought it for me as a Christmas present a few years ago. I fell in love and finished the trilogy as quickly as I could get my hands on each book. I bought the first season and binge watched every episode in a single sitting. Then hubby watched it with me. He enjoyed the story and commented on how he could see why I enjoyed the books so much. \n\nAfter watching the season twice in a week I was more than ready for a re-read, and then it hit me: if he enjoyed the Cave Bear audiobook, why don't I just read this one aloud to him? I'm pretty good at it, even if I'm not great with voices and stutter occasionally, but it's something I've always enjoyed when I did it for school, reading to my siblings/our daughter, etc.\n\nLong story short, we are almost finished with the second book in the trilogy and he loves it as much as I do! All these years I've wanted to share this passion with him and we have finally found a way to enjoy books together. I couldn't be happier. \n\n(Posting this on mobile so apologies in advance for any formatting issues. Also, I'm no author so go easy on my grammar lol.)",
