I am LOVING this new way of presenting a fantasy world (for me). I've always liked heist stories, Oceans 11, you name it. To present one in a fantasy world with a unique magic system is very refreshing for both heist stories and fantasy. I'm loving not having the same old \"hero on a quest\" or \"legend predicted this\" structure. It's making me wonder what a novel with a fantasy setting that is also a murder mystery would be like. These genre crossovers are very fun, and I hope to stumble across more like this. What do you guys think, and is there any crossover you would like to see?",
