I think that he was angry because of his previous incident with the De Lacey family and when he heard the name Frankenstein from William he just had an excuse to do his deed.</li>\n<li>A friend of mine also said that the monster just wanted a companion and Frankenstein refused that also which forced him to kill more people, to that I would like to say that Frankenstein did try to make the companion but he stopped because I think he was right to fear that what if the next creature had her own free will and she didn&#39;t want to live with the monster wouldn&#39;t then the original creature get angry and then try to kill Frankenstein or worse.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am also not saying that Frankenstein was innocent, He was partially responsible for the deaths around him but to label him a monster is very extreme in my opinion in fact he was a deeply flawed human just like every other human that faced the monster in the novel and if that makes Frankenstein a monster I believe then every other person is also a monster.</p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on who was the monster I would love to know and I am not a literary genius this is my 3rd classic and if I have missed something do tell me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
