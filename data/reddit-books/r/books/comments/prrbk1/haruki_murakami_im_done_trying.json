I listened to The Beatles song, to get in the right mood and, yes, Murakami’s writing (or the translation of it) is delicate and has this evocative imagery that help you to get lost in this world. … Fast forward … </p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">So, the main character stays at Naoko place - the former girlfriend of his best friend, who killed himself. It’s her 20 birthdays. She drinks too much. He wants to go, but she does not stop talking. Then stops talking and she starts crying – but silently. He comforts her. Then he sleeps with her. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">“She made it clear that she wanted me to give her release” It’s really him sleeping with her – less a shared experience. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">It’s her first time. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">“Her cry was the saddest sound of orgasm I had ever heard” – even more romantic. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">After it ended, he asked her, why she never had sex with her former boyfriend.

Please call me soon. Happy Birthday.” </span></p>\n\n<p>This whole passage reads like the pinnacle of every bad tropes about women I’ve encounter so far. It made me feel so uncomfortable and not in an – I must question my beliefs – uncomfortable way. It feels hollow and sad. Fits the theme of the book, sure. Yet, I really can’t enjoy one dimensional female character. </p>\n\n<p>I’m here to surrender. I might never finish a book by Haruki Murakami, and it makes me sad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
