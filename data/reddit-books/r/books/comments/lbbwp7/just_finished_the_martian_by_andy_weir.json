I loved how much detail was provided when Mark Watney solved problems, and how he used a realistic tone to explain how he was feeling. The movie adaptation was entertaining, but I felt like Matt Damon was an odd pick for Watney. My only real criticism of the book as well as the movie, is that the end seems rushed. In both cases, a few more pages/running time would wrap things up nicely. Overall, I have to thank this sub for this recommendation, and I’m going to read Artemis next.",
