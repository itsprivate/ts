That said, I've accepted that I'm just going to not understand a decent amount of the book as I go through it, even with an annotated guide to follow along with, but with that acceptance I have been able to enjoy the ride a lot more. Joyce truly had a mastery of the english language that few authors before or after him can claim to match, and even in the stretches of the novel where the plot is exceptionally difficult to follow, the prose itself is enjoyable to parse through, as it's almost like putting together pieces to a puzzle. We'll see how long it takes me to finish the second half of the novel and what my impressions are of it after I finish, but as of now I definitely don't regret the time I have put into it.",
