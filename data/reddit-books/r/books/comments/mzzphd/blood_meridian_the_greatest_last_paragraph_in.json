I know it has its fair share of detractors, it’s too meandering, too violent, too philosophical, etc. To each their own, I cannot change your mind. Personally, I thought it was a masterpiece and one of the greatest works of experimental fiction that I have ever read. \n\nI think everything which is so powerful about this novel can be summarized in the last paragraph. I had never thought about what my favorite last paragraph was until reading this book. I have probably reread it six times since finishing and cannot help but be drawn back to it. It is one of the most harrowing passages I have ever read and it serves as a fantastic knot for tying together all of the larger themes, ideas, and meanings of the novel. Everything about it is simply perfect. The lyrical repetition in language, the vividness of imagery, the Biblical allusions, and the deeper metaphorical layers of “the dance”. I found it to be brilliant. The passage is branded into my brain and I know I will go back to reread it many more times. It is a great favorite.\n\nWhat were your thoughts on this final passage? If it did not resonate with you, which final paragraphs have?",
