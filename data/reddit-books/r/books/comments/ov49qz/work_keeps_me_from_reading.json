Once I return home I relax from work for half an hour but then have to do some cooking/cleaning some sports/training - showering - preparing stuff for the next day - laundry - dinner ect. This leaves me around one hour in the evening where I can read before I have to go to sleep. And I dont even watch TV. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I have even less time in the evening because I have to buy some groceries on the way home, meet with a friend, repair stuff, call friends/family ect </p>\n\n<p>Yet I hear from some people that they come home - drop everything and read for like 4-5 hours every evening before going to sleep. Like when do you do all the other stuff? I have to do most of the housework mentioned above or my apprtment would be a total mess. I &quot;have to&quot; meet up/keep in touch with family/friends or I would be a total loner. I simply cannot fathom to read for several hours after work because then I would have no time left for anything else and my life would be a total mess.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
