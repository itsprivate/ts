I literally had nightmares about this book. The fact that everything that went down in the book started with congress being assassinated and then reading this after the riot at the Capitol on January 6th made me very uncomfortable. This feels like something that could so easily happen if the wrong people came into power. The thought of having my freedoms and independence stripped from me law by law and leaving me just as an empty vessel forced to conceive or die is too much to bear. What are your thoughts and how did you feel after reading this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
