I could have easily believed that Vonnegut was writing about a *real* person.  And the plot! I admit that it took me a while to fully comprehend what was going on, but that’s a testament to Vonnegut’s ability to weave a complicated web that, by the end of the book, reveals itself to be a beautiful tapestry. I would be lying if I were to say I wasn’t emotionally affected by the end of it.\n\nI know it’s not as sexy as some other books out there at the moment, and maybe it’s not as “classic” as something like Moby Dick, but I can genuinely say that Slaughterhouse Five isn’t just the best book I’ve read in the past 10 years, it’s the best STORY I’ve read (or watched) in the past 10 years.  If you think it’s gonna be boring, or scary, or “lame” let me assure you that it’s anything but.  It’s endlessly quotable and searingly memorable, and quite possibly the best book you’ve never read (unless you have).",
