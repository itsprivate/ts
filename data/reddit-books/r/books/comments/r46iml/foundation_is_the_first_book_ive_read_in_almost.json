But sometime during high school I got out of the habit, and literally haven&#39;t read an actual book since then.  Got into computers and programming in college, so I ended up filing my free time with computer stuff and books just fell by the wayside.</p>\n\n<p>Flash forward to today (I&#39;m 47) and I&#39;m trying to detach myself from my cell phone somewhat.  Uninstalled Facebook, instagram, and a few others. We caught a couple episodes of Foundation on AppleTV, and I&#39;m not sure what it was about that show, but I found it fascinating.   Got it into my head that it would be good for me to start reading books again. And I&#39;ll be damned if I didn&#39;t read the whole thing last night.  What a quick read! And I have to say it felt really good!  Just the process of sitting on the couch with a book, and getting caught up in some other world was such a nice change of pace from the normal.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what exactly the point of this post is, except that I&#39;m kind of excited about reading again, and wanted to tell someone...😆 As far as the book goes, I was a little surprised that there wasn&#39;t a little more happening at the end, but I suppose it IS just the beginning of a very long story.  Amazon has a &quot;buy 2 get 1 free&quot; sale on those books, so I just ordered the next 3 in the series.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
