It was a good idea, not amazingly well written, but honestly the gripe is with the 19 year old, fresh out of school, girl, \"falling in love\" with her 30+ year old mentor, the end of the book and teaser for the second book implying it would be reciprocated. And I remembered reading a \"Newbury and Hobbes\" book a friend lent me and running into more or less the same trope and being skeeved out by it then too - the whole 'bright young woman falls for older mentor' business.\n\nWhy is this such a prevalent theme, especially, it seems, in fantasy? Maybe I'm just reading the wrong books. I appreciate these are relatively pulpy titles. You almost-never seem to find either genuine teacher/pupil relationships, M/F friendships or heck, an old(er) woman having an adventure in general, without some weird age-mismatched romance being shoehorned in. Am I alone in finding that sort of addition really - unpleasant? I felt genuinely dirty putting down 'The Paper Magician' - this girl has known this man not even 6 months, he's had endless more experience than her and it's treated like a sweet romance? There was genuinely no need for the romance at all. I'd believe she wanted to save her teacher because she liked and respected him *as a teacher and mentor*, not because she's \\*suddenly in lurve\\*. \n\nMaybe I'm too old for what is essentially a YA book, but being 35+ myself doesn't mean I don't want to read about magic and also - where are the women heroes my own age that I can relate to? Older men are magical heroes all over the place but they have to be paired with a younger smart-but-wide-eyed woman to Teach His Skills To and of course, fall in love. \n\nI appreciate the real world bleeds into these books and of course, older women are usually considered less attractive and/or busy having babies to have adventures (...mild /s, but also some truth in it...), but it's *fantasy*, come on, writers, live a little? Is there not a target audience of middle aged, non-child-having (...or even HAVING-children women who can do more than one thing in their life at a time or have invested in a child-carrying backpack) women who want an adventure? Not even a romance. Just a story with an older magical heroine.\n\nAre there any books I'm missing to disabuse me of this feeling that this is the only book around? Am I alone in feeling genuinely squicked by massive age-gap romance in what's not even, primarily, a romance novel?\n\nI'll be amused if this is downvoted to all heck since it's my first post and heyyyyy, maybe I am a bitter old woman. ;) But anyone feel the same in any way?!\n\nEh, I've got 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' on my list next so maybe that'll cheer me up. ;)",
