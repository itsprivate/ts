At first, I was surprised at how closely the two matched. Especially given the track record of Stephen King adaptations, I didn't expect a near one-to-one in some sections.\n\nMuch as I adore the film, the book got deeper under my skin. We see the beauty of little moments and small \"miracles\" contrasting a bleak setting. This is death row, so maybe anything can seem light when compared to what's coming next. Still, I found myself laughing and smiling at the descriptions of Mr. Jingles' antics. I had to, otherwise the rest of the book would've overwhelmed me.\n\nThe senseless and random tragedies of life fill most of the pages. The intense focus on Paul's experience keeps it manageable, but man, it still hurts. Percy Whetmore is a brilliant character, and I hate him. I loathe him with every fiber of my being, because I recognize him. The description of juvenile malice, the people who can't laugh at a joke unless it's mean, made me think of a few real world Percys.\n\nYet, it's a beautiful story. Even if the book-only conclusion is one of the most pensive and melancholic things I've read in a while. So many of the events and choices are drenched in a palpable uncertainty. Was this the right thing? Did any of it matter? This was the story I needed right now.\n\nDespite it's bluntness, it remains life-affirming. Even something as minor as a mouse doing tricks can be cause for celebration. A companion can make help ease that walk down the Mile. Part of me wants to be mad because I'll never write anything this good, but hot damn, Stephen King, you made a masterpiece. Thanks for breaking me down and building me back up. I loved every page.",
