And I've been sporadically looking at the author Liz Keller's other books such as Philippa Fisher and a Year without Autumn.\n\nIt helped me a lot. Reading those books about the power of friendship and making things better for everyone just helped me get through my feelings. Helped me realize things can get better.\n\nI'm feeling a lot better now. I still have moments of feeling down but it's nowhere near as bad as that one week. Those books gave me something to focus on. Something positive.\n\nLiz if you're reading this(Which I doubt) thanks for helping me get through a really rough time in my life and I think you're a super underrated children's author.",
