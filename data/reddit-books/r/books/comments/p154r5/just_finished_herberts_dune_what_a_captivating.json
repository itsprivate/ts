I started with Foundation trilogy, and it was very good: the time scale and vast number of interwoven storylines felt epic (although I struggle to imagine how one makes a TV show out of such a... saga). However, Dune completely outshone Foundation for me: the way it focuses on characters, how it depicts different styles of leadership and warfare, the integrity of the fictional world all made the story so real and gripping.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve only finished the first book and heard mixed reviews of other parts of the Dune series, but I&#39;m still inclined to give them a go. And I highly recommend Dune to anyone who is in the same boat as me, and didn&#39;t get to read it earlier for some reason!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
