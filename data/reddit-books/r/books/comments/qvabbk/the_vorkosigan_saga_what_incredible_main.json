I wish someone had told me about them a long time ago, I don&#39;t think the series is getting nearly the attention it deserves. At first blush they are breezy, page-turning, character-driven sci fi, but there is so much happening beneath the surface. The books delve so deeply into the meaning of personal identity and how to thrive in rigid, top-down society that tries to marginalize almost everyone.</p>\n\n<p>The series follows the members of the Vorkosigan family, one of the feudal ruling families on the planet Barrayar, and is loosely episodic, so you can read them in any order. Three of the books (The <em>Vor Game, Barrayar,</em> and <em>Mirror Dance</em>) won the Hugo award in the early 90s.</p>\n\n<p>The Vorkosigan family are the main advisers to generations of Barrayaran emperors, and have to use their wits and intellect to get the empire out of trouble and slowly push Barrayaran society out of its backward nature.</p>\n\n<p>Miles Vorkosigan is the main character in a lot of the novels, and is so incredibly likeable. He&#39;s a dwarf who suffers from several physical disabilities, but he&#39;s wildly brilliant, funny, and imperious, and is constantly throwing himself into danger to protect his friends and family (or just get himself out of a jam of his own making). His mother, Cordelia, is the main character in <em>Barrayar</em>, and if possible, is even more likeable than Miles. She&#39;s an off-worlder on a planet full of chauvinism and sexism, but perseveres through it all, and her relationship with her husband is so incredible - a real partnership rather than a power struggle.</p>\n\n<p>I think they&#39;re a perfect intro to sci fi for anyone new to the genre, and a refreshing read for any longtime sci fi fan too.  Can&#39;t recommend highly enough!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
