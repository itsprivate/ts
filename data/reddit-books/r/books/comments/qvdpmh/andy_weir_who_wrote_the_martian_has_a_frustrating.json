I felt a wiggle that time. My eyelids moved. I felt it.”</p>\n\n<p>“‘Holy moly!’ I say. ‘Holy moly’? Is that my go-to expression of surprise? I mean, it’s okay, I guess. I would have expected something a little less 1950s. What kind of weirdo am I?”</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My problem isn’t so much the substitutes for swear words. It’s more that his language is so basic-twee. He has so many phrases similar to: “so…I did a thing.” and “I want to go to there.” And “Oops…I made a swear.” And often his adjectives and adverbs are so bad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
