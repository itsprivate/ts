Persuasion needs to be mentioned more often! I loved everything about it, except the length, but I know that it was published after Austen's death.

Her musings on love and friendship are so moving and I just wanted to give her a hug the entire time I was reading. It was rewarding watching her grow as a person. She's definitely my favorite Austen heroine. Frederick also deserves a shout out. That letter at the end of the book even got me, who's not that big on romance, to swoon. \n\nP.S. Also watched the 1995 adaption with Amanda Root as Anne and Ciaran Hinds as Frederick. SO GOOD! THAT CHEMISTRY. THOSE LOOKS THAT PASS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.",
