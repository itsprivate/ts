I realized that most of the time that I did try starting to read, I gave up because the book was too difficult or dry for me stick with for a long period of time. I realized that I needed to build up my &quot;reading strength&quot;. It doesn&#39;t make sense to lift 300 lbs if can&#39;t even lift 150 lbs yet.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I picked up an easy, casual book on my kindle and each night spent 30 min to an hour reading it. It was about 250-270 pages. Some nights I did not read at all. Some nights I just read a little bit. Most nights I read an average amount. My goal was just to finish the book.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I finally finished it. Although one book is not a huge deal for most people in this sub, given that I have not read anything to its entirety since high school (I&#39;m 25 now) I&#39;m so happy that I didn&#39;t stop reading entirely cause I was bored or wanted to do something else.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, just wanted to share. Thanks :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
