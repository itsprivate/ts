Found the story very captivating whilst still having the inferable depth that makes sci-fi great! Before this had read Asimov and Silverberg&#39;s &quot;Nightfall&quot; so was already expecting good things from &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, and yet still my expectations were surpassed! Highly recommend for any fans of science fiction. I don&#39;t read much murder mystery but I&#39;m sure this book would be good for fans of them, not just science fiction.</p>\n\n<p>Am looking forward to my copy of &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; to arrive in the post so I can continue the series :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
