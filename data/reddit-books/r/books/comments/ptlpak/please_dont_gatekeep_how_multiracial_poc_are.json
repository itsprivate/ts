And while I do think some criticisms are valid, such as clear moments when authors that are not of that race didn&#39;t do their research, it&#39;s very frustrating when someone decides they aren&#39;t X enough because they&#39;re not participating in the culture of X  race.</p>\n\n<p>News flash, if the child grows up in America or Britain or any country that isn&#39;t their own, it&#39;s completely possible for them to grow up without cultural ties. As a first-gen myself, not only did I grow up without those ties, but what is considered &quot;cultural&quot; to my race is deeply tied to prevalent religions. Am I less representative of my race because I don&#39;t practice any of the major religions, and therefore don&#39;t participate in things the world has deemed the &quot;culture&quot; of my country?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that for many people, it&#39;s amazing when a character has your ethnicity. I feel that way too! I feel seen, I feel kinship just by the mere appearance of a POC. But if that character fails to be relatable to you beyond that, it doesn&#39;t mean the author has failed to create a person of your race.</p>\n\n<p>This is not knocking against criticisms for diverse character representations. Obviously a certain amount of research and respect is required. I&#39;m just asking to think carefully on where your criticism is stemming from. Because every time I read a comment knocking an American or British born character for not being <em>insert my race here</em> enough, I feel my own existence invalidated a bit more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
