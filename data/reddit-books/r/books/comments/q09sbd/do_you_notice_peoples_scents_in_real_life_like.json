For context: if you&#39;ve done a good bit of reading, particularly in romance novels, authors love to use a person&#39;s scent as a descriptor or way that another character identifies that person. For instance, I just read a book where the male character was obsessed with his best friend&#39;s &quot;peach-scented shampoo.&quot; This character went so far as to go and buy a bottle of peach shampoo to sniff when he missed her. When she would leave his home, he could still smell her &quot;lingering scent.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen this many times in books, but I just wonder if, in real life, anyone actually notices stuff like this. Yes, occasionally someone smells either really good or really bad, but I&#39;ve yet to find someone that has this consistently identifiable smell. Of course, different people&#39;s homes may have a smell, or you may remember someone like your elderly grandma having a medicinal smell. I just don&#39;t remember ever having some consistently highly identifiable smell that I associated with a person in a positive way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
