And I wonder if that would be enjoyable to read? What would make that kind of story a good read? And which books do this well? Would you consider these to be more realistic? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking about books where, say, the protagonist doesn&#39;t end up with &quot;the one&quot;, or they don&#39;t carry out their mission to completion, or they just end up returning to where/how they were in the beginning, what they wanted to do made their situation even worse at the end, etc... (Not ones where they accidentally die or something.)</p>\n\n<p>I assume the replies to this post will have spoilers so anyone who ventures below, please beware.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
