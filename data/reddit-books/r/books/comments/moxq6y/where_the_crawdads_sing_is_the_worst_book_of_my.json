It was not just a waste of time, but it was so horrendous, it feels like it took part of my soul with it as I closed the cover. I have literally NO idea why it is so popular. The more I think about it, the angrier I get. It was truly awful. How so? \n\n1. The slow pace of the novel, then the final 1/10 that was insanely rushed. \n2. The characters. Absolutely unrealistic and annoying. And I hated all of them. \n3. Far-reaching plot threads the reader is just supposed to believe. Sure, a CHILD grows up in the marsh by herself and then becomes a bestselling author and expert. Sure Jan. \n4. Stereotypical portrayal of Southerners.\n5. There is NO WAY any Southern Baptist church lady would allow a child to be raised alone in the 1960s. \n6. Alllllll the horrendous, gratuitous dropping of bad poetry. The main character escapes an attempted rape. And what does she do? Recite poetry. It’s cringe-worthy. I’m talking Junior-high type of cringeworthy writing. It’s like the author is saying “look at me! I’m so talented I can spin a novel AND write poetry! I’m a Renaissance Woman!” No. Plus, she shows off all her botanical knowledge talking in great detail about the environment and fauna of the marsh. Is this a novel or a natural science textbook?  All these flip flops took me out of the novel’s pace and felt disjointed and fake. \n7. The ending and “surprise” plot twist—ugggg. It’s not even a shock. It just leaves a bitterness in the reader because the author spent so much time convincing us this wasn’t the case...and then it was. It left me feeling lied to and conned by some half-baked con artist and now I’m just embarrassed I fell for it. \n8. Just to be nit picky...Kya lives in a MARSH, and has never seen a doctor or a dentist or even a regular shower. Yet supposedly she has men fawning over her and drooling over her incessant beauty. All I could think about was how she must desperately need a toothbrush and maybe a bar of soap. This did not conjure up images of sexuality or beauty. \n\nThe whole thing was such a disaster. I cannot imagine how people liked it. It makes me think the NYT was bribed to endorse it. It also makes me weep for the state of literature and literacy in this nation. If THIS is what  people think is the pinnacle of novel writing, we’re screwed.",
