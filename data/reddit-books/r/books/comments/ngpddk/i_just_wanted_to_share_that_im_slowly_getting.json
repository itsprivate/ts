I felt guilty about it because it meant I spent less and less time doing one of my favorite things: Reading. I would usually read some every day, whenever possible, but my reading rate slowly declined. At Christmas, I got about 25 new books! I tried to read some to pull myself back in, and that helped. However, I only read about half of them and in a short period of time. I still haven't read the rest. \n\nFrom the latter half of January to the first half of April, I read 0 books. The closest I got was Webtoons (that site/app is pretty good tho). finally, I decided to choose a book that was easy to read and I already knew, but not too well: The Class by Frances O'Roark Dowell. Not a particularly fancy book, just fun to read. There was another week or two where I didn't read much of anything, but then I remembered how fun and rewarding it felt to read and finish The Class.\n\nI decided to read The Hunger Games, an engrossing book and a favorite of mine. I dove into it and spent hours in one day finishing it. That felt really good. Now, *finally,* I felt like I was getting somewhere. I decided to read Catching fire (which I have read before) but only managed to get through the first two chapters. This discouraged me, and I stopped for about a week.\n\nNow, however, I'm reading a new book! The first book in the Wings of Fire series! I've already read them all and loved them. They're a kids' series but I don't think adults would mind it if they had to read the series.  I'm reading it because I joined an online school book club. I'm very grateful to this club for giving me motivation.\n\nI think that after a while of reading books I've already read, I will finally start reading new ones; I am incredibly excited for that.\n\nTL;DR The pandemic caused me to stop reading but I'm getting back into it one book at a time.",
