Train was packed. When Amir says „For you, a thousand times over“ on the last page (people who read the book might get it) the decision was made for me.\nCouldn‘t care less though: best cry I had in a long while. Wholesome tears.\nI‘ve never been to Afghanistan -they wouldn‘t let me in when I traveled along the border (mostly on the Pamir Highway) - but damn. Really broadend my horizon.\nWould recommend.\nObligatory excuse my engish. Feel free to correct me. Trying to improve.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
