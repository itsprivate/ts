I thought it was very well done how Jackson slowly pulls you further and further into Merricat’s world and way of thinking that you don’t even realize how deep you’ve gotten until you step away from the book at the end. Overall the book kind of reads like a pre ghost story of a haunted house or the legend of a witch, but in a very understated way which makes it quite powerful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
