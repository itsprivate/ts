It didn&#39;t introduce many new concepts to me, but Hesse explained these concepts so beautifully and simply, that it was as if I were hearing them for the first time. I&#39;m not an avid reader anymore- this is the first book I&#39;ve finished in 3 years, but I tore through Siddhartha in no time. I identified with Siddhartha&#39;s spiritual baselessneess, his quest for meaning in a place with so many lifestyles and philosophies, yet with no true answer to our suffering. The most poignant passage to me is near the end, when Siddhartha explains the difference between searching and finding, and if you search your whole life, you&#39;ll miss all the answers that were right under your nose. This was the best book I&#39;ve ever read- I will re-read it, I will suggest it to anyone who I think might find it applicable to their own life, and I will continue to ponder the lessons presented by Hesse.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: grammar</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
