  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As the title says, I hate sex scenes in novels. This is mostly it&#39;s because it&#39;s always so <em>perfect</em>. Even if it&#39;s the first encounter between teen virgins, they always feel each other&#39;s bodies <em>perfectly</em>, they&#39;re so in <em>synchrony</em>, every touch <em>has</em> to send a thousand electric volts through their flesh (and they use &quot;flesh&quot; a lot). There&#39;s never any awkwardness for first encounters. The woman always orgasms extremely vociferously, and the man always knows exactly what to do to get her to that state, and they <em>always</em> climax together. Every damn time.</p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s always described so prettily. &quot;She was hot and smooth, my knife to her butter.&quot; Yes, that&#39;s an exact quote. Other popular terms I&#39;ve seen are rhythm, stirring of souls, something to with stars or heaven moving, silkiness, being as one, you get the idea. And it&#39;s like...sure it&#39;s nice, but seriously? It&#39;s not pretty or poetic. It&#39;s a rather messy and sweaty activity, but somehow, <em>no one</em> ever talks about the smells or stickiness. No, they always taste like cucumbers or cherries or honey and they smell absolutely wonderful. I&#39;m not saying sex scenes in book should go into all the detail about the mess, but the ones I&#39;ve read try and make it sound so pretty and <em>clean</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You can probably tell this really annoys me. I get that you&#39;d want to sound nice and language-y, but this is just setting up unrealistic expectations and standards, especially for first encounters. It&#39;s such a minor thing compared to everything else that could be wrong with a novel, but it always breaks suspension of disbelief for me and makes me roll my eyes all the way to the back of my skull.</p>\n\n<p>Why, no, I <em>don&#39;t</em> like romance novels or even romance subplots unless they actively contribute to the story and aren&#39;t just excuses to shove in sweaty descriptions of perfect milk-white breasts and huge...bratwursts.</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add: I&#39;m not saying these scenes are in every book I read. I&#39;m not going out of my way to read romance novels. I read across the board, fantasy, non-genre, historical fiction, sci-fi, mystery, nonfiction (though I guess this category isn&#39;t really applicable), etc. What I&#39;m saying is that <em>when they show up</em>, if they&#39;re included at all, they&#39;re disruptive to my immersion. I&#39;m talking specifically about when a story&#39;s been great and intrigue-y up until that point, and then it takes a two-page long break in action to talk about bodily fluids. And it&#39;s not as if I can filter out these books, either, because how are you supposed to know that it has over-described sex scenes unless you read it? The sex scenes alone aren&#39;t typically enough to turn me off a book completely. They&#39;re just really annoying.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
