We used to play down there all the time so naturally I ended up looking through most of them. In one was this huge thousand page book with the old cover for the complete and uncut editon (The coolest cover btw). Around this time I had fallen in love with reading and wanted to get my hands on everything. When my I asked my dad if I could read it all he said, \"No, its way to scary.\" For years I always wondered what was so spooky about it. Eveyone I asked said the same thing and even when I got older I was still never allowed to read it. That is untill I got really bored and decided to read it stuck in my appartment during quarintine.\n\n**It really is that spooky -** Books have never scared me, but this one did. Usualy when you think of being scared you think of a jump scare of something like that, this was completely different. It is more like a long spiraling decent of a jump scare. When I was finished reading it I was unsettled for like 2 days. I have never been left with that sort of feeling durring and especially after finishing a book. What makes it worse is the cotent of the book and what is going on today. I could not have picked a better book to read durring this time and I am super glad I did. So for anyone who likes 1000 page books that are deeply disturbing and biblical and have all this really cool stuff, this one is for you.",
