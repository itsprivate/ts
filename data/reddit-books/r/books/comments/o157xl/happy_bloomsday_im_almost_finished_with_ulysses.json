I'd heard it's one of the toughest books to read, so I figured it would be an interesting challenge. I found a guide online to help me through it, and it's actually been my favorite book I've read so far this year! I'm in the penultimate chapter, and should finish in the next day or two.\n\nI'm wildly impressed by Joyce. He had an incredible grasp of language and history, and could write astonishingly beautiful prose. Language and style are like different hats he tries on for the various chapters; it's fun to watch him play in the language. His characters (Bloom in particular) are also so real and fully formed. He isn't afraid to gaze hard at the flaws of his characters (and they're deeply flawed), but that makes their redeeming qualities even sweeter and more precious. The book doesn't have much in the way of plot. It's more like real life. You're along for a journey without a clear beginning or end, but it ultimately is beautiful and meaningful despite its apparent formlessness. I've found this to be an absolutely profound experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone willing to rethink what a book can/should be.",
