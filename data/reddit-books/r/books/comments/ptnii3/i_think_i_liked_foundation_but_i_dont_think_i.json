The characters all started to feel the same after a while, like they were all speaking with the same voice. Its made me not really want to finish the trilogy despite the fact that, again, I think the premise is fascinating and I liked the core plot when it was all said and done. Have you ever felt this way about an author&#39;s work?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
