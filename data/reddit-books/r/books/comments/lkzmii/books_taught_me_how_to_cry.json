I recently found out that that was a myth, and wanted to learn how to do it again, to recover from the trauma that stopped my tears. It was hard. I told myself it was a manly, brave, and a strong thing to do. I&#39;ve cried occasionally over the last two years.\nLately I&#39;ve been crying more. I&#39;ve been reading emotional books: young adult literature 📚</p>\n\n<p>Crying with the characters from Perks of Being a Wallflower, How I Live Now, Anne Frank&#39;s Diary, and Solitaire is therapeutical and safe, and crying somehow makes coping with the you-know-what global situation easier. I appreciate my friends more and the world is overwhelmingly beautiful at times. It&#39;s largely due to this community that I&#39;ve been reading much more. Thank you all. Peace and love.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
