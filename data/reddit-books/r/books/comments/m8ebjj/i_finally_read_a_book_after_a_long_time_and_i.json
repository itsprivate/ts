I used to read a lot and I'm talking upwards of 100 books a year but as high school became increasingly hard, I had to cut down. Or maybe that was just an excuse because I found myself repeatedly turning to Netflix and Youtube for entertainment and I was never able to find that satisfaction that reading gave me. \n\nLast year I managed to read all of 4 books and that too only in the first few months as I had a bit more time on my hands then. This year, I hadn't read a single book completely despite the fact I got a kindle in the hope that I could awaken the love I had for reading. Last week however I decided that if I really wanted to read, I have to sincerely take some action towards it and I blocked Netflix and other streaming sites and decided that I was going to actively reduce them out of my life while increasing the time I spend reading. At first, I was ashamed by how hard it was for me to pick a book up even though I had nothing else to do. I'd prefer to sit bored rather than pick a book up. However yesterday I decided I would try to pick up a book that I had read many years before in the hopes that it would reduce the friction and it most certainly did. I picked up Russian Roulette by Anthony Horowitz and while I found it a bit childish now, I felt really nostalgic as I read it and most importantly it reawoke that passion I had for reading. \n\nI had forgotten how amazing it was to be obsessed with a book, so much so that I stayed up the entire night to finish it and when I was done, I felt the familiar satisfaction I had gotten from reading all those years ago. I intend to continue reading the rest of the year and while it might be a bit late for me to finish my original goal of 52 books this year (I'm in my last year of high school which only gets over in July), I most certainly want to give it a shot. To all those of you struggling to get back into reading, I implore you to turn off all other sources of distraction if you're serious about it and make sure you really try to get back into reading. You'll be amazed by how better you'll feel after.",
