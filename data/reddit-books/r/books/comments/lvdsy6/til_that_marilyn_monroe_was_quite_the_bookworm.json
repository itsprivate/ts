The whole thing was interesting, but the list that I found most intriguing was Marilyn Monroe&#39;s. Some of the stuff listed included:</p>\n\n<p><em>The Sun Also Rises</em> by Ernest Hemingway</p>\n\n<p><em>Ulysses</em> by James Joyce</p>\n\n<p><em>On the Road</em> by Jack Kerouac</p>\n\n<p><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Dostoyevsky</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always found Ms. Monroe to be a fascinating person. I tend to be drawn to tragic figures, so I always knew she was more than the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; image that was thrown at her. Still, there&#39;s a lot that I don&#39;t know about her, like her passion for literature. She apparently even wrote her own poetry!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On the screen of pitch blackness<br/>\ncomes the shapes of monsters<br/>\nmy most steadfast companions …<br/>\nand the world is sleeping<br/>\nah peace I need you – even a peaceful monster.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I did a bit more digging and became more and more fascinated. She shared her mantra for exploring various titles when a director caught her reading a copy of Rilke&#39;s <em>Letters to a Young Poet:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On nights when I’ve got nothing else to do, I go to the Pickwick bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard and just open books at random—when I come to a page or a paragraph I like, I buy that book. So last night I bought this one. Is that wrong?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She also dug Camus, Beckett, Tolstoy, and even had a first edition copy of Ralph Ellison&#39;s <em>Invisible Man</em> which, as an African American, I find very endearing, although she already had shown her support for civil rights so I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised!</p>\n\n<p>She also had a heavily marked copy of <em>The Little Engine That Could.</em> That book always struck a chord with me as a kid and I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t admit to thinking about it during some darker periods of my own adult life. I know Ms. Monroe struggled with her own sense of insecurity, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that book was on her mind as well (although that&#39;s obviously speculation on my part).</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, I just thought I&#39;d shed some light on another side of her that most people might not have been aware of.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
