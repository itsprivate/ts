The story was great and the story-telling was superb, it kept my interesting trough the whole story, and made Ender feel relatable and real.

Toward the end I was sure that there is a second book, because I thought there is no way they wrap it up in 50 pages, so it gave me a mind blown moment. Coming back to the game, to Peter, to his traumas and it all build up so perfectly toward the entire story, it&#39;s one of the most complete books I&#39;ve read.</p>\n\n<p>This book has ruined my standards and I know future books going to let me down now in comparison to this one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
