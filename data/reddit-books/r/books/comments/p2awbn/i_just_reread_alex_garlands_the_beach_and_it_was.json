I&#39;m 32 mow and I&#39;ve reread the book or the first time and I&#39;m shocked at how intensely naive and self centred the character is. Although he has some somewhat redeeming qualities to him, he&#39;s an extremely dislikeable protagonist. Though I can still see why my 20 year old self liked him, I&#39;m shocked at how much I&#39;ve changed in the time between reads and how that&#39;s altered my perspective of the character and the book in general. </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any examples of your perspective of a character/book changing over time?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
