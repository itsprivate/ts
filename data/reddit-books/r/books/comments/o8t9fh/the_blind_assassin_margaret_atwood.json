I&#39;d never heard of it (Or Margaret Atwood for that matter) but I looked it up and saw that it was mostly met with positive reviews. The biggest thing I read was about her style of writing, but I was in no way prepared for the way this woman tears through your soul. So many chapters ending with quotes that leave my hair standing on end. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s due to her being a poet, but I get goosebumps so often and I&#39;m only 200 pages in. I cannot put this book down.</p>\n\n<p>I think she describes mental health fantastically, without ever saying that&#39;s what she&#39;s doing. I knew after the first chapter that I&#39;d be hooked when she ended it with &quot;<em>Tell me where it hurts,</em> she&#39;d say. <em>Stop howling. Just calm down and show me where.</em>\nBut some people can&#39;t tell where it hurts. They can&#39;t calm down. They can&#39;t ever stop howling&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t wait to of finished this book and be able to share my full thoughts on it. Truly the only book I have ever felt compelled to write and talk about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
