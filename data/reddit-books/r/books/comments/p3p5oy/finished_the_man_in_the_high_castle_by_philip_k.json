Dick book, and so not by this one. Germany &amp; Japan have won World War II and the world is now in total fascism. North America is split between Japan &amp; Germany and there is kind of cold war going on between these two winning parties.</p>\n\n<p>Totally believable how he described how the world could have look liked if the fascist would have prevailed after the War. There are of course the mad things the fascists would have done, but there is also some justification for it why fascism has it flaws but is superior (in the eye of an fascist protagonist in the book). That side makes it kind of spooky and takes it away from the usual &quot;Nazis are super and clearly evil&quot;. This is of course all wrong, but you get an idea about what made fascism so fascinating and dangerous back in the 30s/40s. </p>\n\n<p>The writing of Philip K. Dick is just superb. It just has a nice flow, you can just read pages of pages without getting stuck and re-reading sentences. It also has a very, very good written &quot;scene&quot; where a person is drugged and does something in a kind of delirium. While reading it the text slips slowly into weirdness, when you read it is almost like you took the drug and experience it yourself through a hazy mist. Very fascinating written. Have to read all of Philip K. Dick, have to order his whole canon right away :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
