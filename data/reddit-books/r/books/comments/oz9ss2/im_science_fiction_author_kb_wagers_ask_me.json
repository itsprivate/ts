Wagers, non-binary author of the Indranan and Farian War trilogies from Orbit Books and the NeoG Adventures from Harper Voyager - including the recently released Hold Fast Through the Fire. I write about the Near-Earth Orbital Guard&#39;s Interceptor teams as they patrol the space in the solar system and participate in an interservice competition called the Boarding Games. My characters are highly competent professionals who also have terrible senses of humor and the near future world has a host of queernormativity because this isn&#39;t your father&#39;s military science fiction. <em>winks</em> I&#39;m a fan of whiskey and cats, Jupiter Ascending and the Muppets. I love plants and have about 70 of them ranging in size from four feet to four inches. I play video games terribly and have a slightly dusty 2nd degree black belt in Shaolin Kung Fu, ask me anything! You can find links to my books at kbwagers.com and hit me up on Twitter @kbwagers or Instagram @midwaybrawler for video game rants and plant photos.</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ri2wzqw2xef71.jpg\">https://i.redd.it/ri2wzqw2xef71.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
