To be fair it did pick up and get legitimately solid between around the 70% and 90% points, but everything before and after just felt very... bleh.  Not a terrible book, to be sure, but very, very far from the &quot;masterpiece&quot; I guess I was expecting.</p>\n\n<p>Is it just a matter of my expectations being way too high? Is there some kind of secret sauce I&#39;ve just missed that makes this book in particular resonate with so many people?  Or was this one of those works that was ground-breaking in its day but has now been copied so often that it&#39;s lost its original punch?</p>\n\n<p>Legitimately interested in hearing differing opinions... thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
