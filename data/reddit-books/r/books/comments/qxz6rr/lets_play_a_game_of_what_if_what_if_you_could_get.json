Would the new release be better? What changes would there be? </p>\n\n<p>This also got me thinking it shouldn&#39;t be a complete new book with the same premise it should be more or less a revised version. Maybe with a different ending or beginning or maybe with a different tone. For example one of my guilty pleasures is Ready Player One. I love listening to it on audible as background noise. I&#39;m probably on my 16th listen. Yet as much as I enjoy it the whole book is a cringe fest. I&#39;d love to has this book be rewritten by a different author one who does YA better with less cringe. </p>\n\n<p>So what book would you enjoy being revised and by what author?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
