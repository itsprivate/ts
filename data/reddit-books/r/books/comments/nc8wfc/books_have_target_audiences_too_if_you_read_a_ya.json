It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.\n\nThey aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on. Books have demographics just as much as TV and movies. An adult doesn't go to see the Wiggles and expect to have a good time (although they are surprisingly enjoyable) or critique their children's Saturday cartoons or their teenager's cringe  werewolf romance drama show for being simplistic and predicable. It's great to them because it's for them. It's crap to you because you're never expected to watch it anyway. That's okay. There's really no need to tear those things apart in a reddit post.\n\nObviously there will be some adults who will still love YA books, shows, and movies. If that's you, please keep recommending them to people. It's not your fault if someone neglects to notice the YA or TV14 tag and ends up hating it.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying \"you're not the target audience\" is an end all excuse so you can never say something is bad. Some books are indesputably bad. I believe that if you hold an opinion that contradicts what is widely accepted as true, then it's probably more about your personal preference than something being inherently bad. For instance, I hate Avengers movies and think they are full of crudely written dialogue and oversized casts where no character actually matters. Obviously the world disagrees with that opinion. I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.",
