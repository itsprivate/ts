Not knowing any better (at all), I compared the two series (I was obsessed w HP) and as a result, was bullied in class. Badly. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, its been really difficult for me to read the main series (I read the hobbit one summer for summer reading and loved it) and watch the movies, because it always brought my mind back to those days and reminded me of those who bullied me. </p>\n\n<p>Well this year I made the resolution to read all my TBR pile before buying any new books, and the LOtR books were a part of it. I decided to bite the bullet and get started. Well just over two weeks later I have 50 pages left of the Fellowship and plan to bring the second book with me on vacation to read on the beach. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so glad I finally gave this series a chance. I knew I was a stubborn, ignorant, shitty 6th grader, but man those girls were bitches. The story is so enveloping it&#39;s become difficult to put down and, when I finally got started reading, those triggering thoughts never came to mind. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry that I compared this to Harry Potter, and I&#39;m sorry it took this long to finally open these books, but I&#39;m just so happy that I did, and look forward to reading the next two. </p>\n\n<p>Sidenote, if it&#39;s important to know - I have watched the movies, but that was so long ago I don&#39;t remember any of them, and even then I still felt uncomfortable because they still reminded me of those darker times. I plan on rewatching the movies as I finish the books, so I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be in a better mind space to do so.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
