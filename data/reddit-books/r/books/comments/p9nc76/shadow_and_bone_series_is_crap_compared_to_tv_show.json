In the show they really go more into developing the deep profound friendship but in the books it&#39;s immediately aline secretly in love with him. Also they made the dynamic too hunger games gale and katniss. ALSO in the show Mal is so much fuller? It takes a secure and humble man to be able to step back and realize he isn&#39;t the main person, to not be insecure by his much more important and powerful counterpart, which from only one book and some spoilers I can tell is gonna be a problem for book Mal.</p>\n\n<p>Three, the backstory and development of the relationship of the darling is sooo much more believable in the show. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s such a  well written show based off a sub par book with great world building. There is so much more but I&#39;m already in love with the show and despite being fully ready to buy the whole world series, like six of crows, I&#39;m done after book one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
