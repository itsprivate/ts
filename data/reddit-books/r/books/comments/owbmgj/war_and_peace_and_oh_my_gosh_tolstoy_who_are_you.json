I had to reread a chapter once I realised Rostov was Nikolai and I’d managed to somehow make him an entirely new character in my head. Thankfully I have a (tiny and not overly useful) character list at the back but honestly, I’m a pretty adept reader at this point and I think either I’m being notoriously dense or that’s just Tolstoy. Got it figured out for the most part now though.</p>\n\n<p>I am really enjoying it so far, I have to say - I thought the description of the banks surrounding the Danube were incredible and this translation flows beautifully. Good choice of book on my part!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
