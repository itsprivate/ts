It may or may not speak to other folks, but I figured I would at least post my experience and see if there was any discussion folks were interested in having.\n\nFor so many years, my main book process has been\n\n1. Search online for genres I like.\n\n2. Look for popular or well reviewed books.\n\n3. Consume books contents.\n\nI liked this system. I read a lot of books I liked over the years and consumed all of the 'must reads' of the genres I enjoy.\n\nSomewhat recently, I decided to check out a single-shop used book store in my area. The guy who runs it buys all the books himself and chooses what he does or does not want to buy.\n\nI took a few hours and just browsed through the book store and waited until something caught my eye. What I realized is that so much of my book searching has been setting criteria and finding vs letting my mind wander and find a book that triggers a response in a specific moment. \n\nOver the past few months, I've found, bought and read the following types of books\n\n1. A book about Bog People. Bog People are bodies found in bogs around the world that are preserved in near perfect condition. So much so, that you can tell what someone ate 2000 years ago as well as their facial expression at death and what their hair was like.\n\n2. A book about womens manners that was published in 1880. What was expected, what was proper manners and what was the best way to live as a 'proper' woman. It was intensely interesting.\n\n3. A book about a guy who did a road trip along the Great Wall in 2007. He wrote about China, what it is to be Chinese and what the modernization of China looks like and everything in between. This book was enthralling.\n\nObviously COVID really limits what we do and what we should do in a public space now, but I really benefited from this experience and wonder if anyone else has anything to say about the process of finding a book to read.\n\nThanks!",
