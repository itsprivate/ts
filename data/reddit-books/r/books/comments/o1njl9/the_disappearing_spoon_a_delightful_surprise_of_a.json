I told my friend who was with me \"I don't wanna pick a science book because that's nerdy but I did horrible this semester and I want to learn SOMETHING, even if it wasn't from school.\" But this book was way more enjoyable than school, as you will see. \n\nThe book is a non-fiction science/history book. It is divided into chapters which focus on different elements of the periodic table and the stories behind the elements themselves, their discoverers, or maybe just their quirks and features. The authors writing style is less academic and more informal, but that does not subtract from how good of a learning source this book is. There are times in which you have to read over paragraphs again to understand what was being said about some particular topics, but for the most part, this book had me reading on and on wondering what would be revealed next about the scientists involved in discovering the elements (K .Fajans got a Nobel Prize revoked because he told a newspaper he was going to win one before the Nobel Committee made it official) or the elements themselves (there are only a few ounces of Astatine in the whole planet). \n\nThis book is great because it is not extensive about one very particular topic, but it bounces around in a coherent way. It has a myriad of stories that stuck with me perfect for when I want to sound smart around people I just met (aluminium was so hard to extract at one point, it was worth more than gold).  Speaking of gold, one time a whole village was torn down because there was gold in its concrete, pavement, and foundations. Back to the book, reading it I never felt like \"damn I've read enough about this, I wish he'd move on,\" the stories were perfectly concise and interesting, and the best part is I felt good about myself reading this because I was actually learning stuff, as I only ever read fiction. \n\nI'd recommend this book to anyone who is into obscure stories and facts and anyone who wants to learn a few cool things about the periodic table. This book is more lighthearted than academic so do not worry about not knowing much already about chemistry or physics, as it is explained quite nicely. Anyway, this is my first time doing a write up on a book since middle school, and I just wanted to show anyone looking for something to read a cool book :).  Also, if you have read the book I'd love to hear what you think about it! Have a good night/morning/evening/day!",
