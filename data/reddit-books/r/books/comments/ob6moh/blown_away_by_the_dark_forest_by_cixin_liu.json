Sure it&#39;s sci-fi, but it goes so far beyond that...I guess I don&#39;t want to ramble too long here, but if you want to read something that will absolutely blow your mind &amp; give you hope for the future, I want to give this my absolute highest recommendation! Just know that you will probably still want to start with Three Body Problem. Think of Three body as a necessary prequel, which lays the groundwork for the extra crazy stuff later on. Also, Three body Problem has its own share of crazy stuff, but the writing quality in The Dark Forest is somehow exponentially better! Has anyone else read this, any other thoughts on it? I realize it&#39;s less about the characters than the ideas, and so could see how somebody could fall off part way through, but I simply wanted to say the pay-off is magnificent. and seriously i never talk this way about books lol, but it really is that good</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
