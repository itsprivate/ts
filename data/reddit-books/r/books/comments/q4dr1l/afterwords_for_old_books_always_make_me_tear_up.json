I think my two favourite afterwords are one from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in one of the Sherlock Holmes anthologies I read, and one by Boris Strugatsky in Roadside Picnic. In the Sherlock Holmes afterword Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has a moment where he is very directly writing to a reader in the future, and I always found it very touching. For Roadside Picnic the afterword is a fascinating look at the hardships of publishing books in the USSR at the time, and the struggles of writing to the whims of other people. Afterwords are rare things, often a regular book wont have one, but I always appreciate how it&#39;s the author taking us away from the story, and instead talking about something they feel the need to talk about. It&#39;s more than the book you just read, it&#39;s more personal.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
