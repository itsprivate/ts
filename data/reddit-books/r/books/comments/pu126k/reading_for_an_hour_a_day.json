After finally finishing a book I&#39;d been stuck on for six months,I decided that from now on I would read for an hour a day. My system is basically read for a minimum of an hour a day and anything over an hour doesn&#39;t roll over to the next day,but if I miss a day I read for two hours the next day. So if I didn&#39;t read all week I would need to read for seven hours on Sunday. I&#39;ve been reading like this for a month and a half and I&#39;ve finished five books. This system has been good for me because I&#39;m not missing out on reading and I still have time for all the real life stuff. Does anybody have their own system?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
