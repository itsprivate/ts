Instead, Robinson grapples with every imaginable solution we could (and might have to) leverage in the next 30ish years to try to save our biosphere from total devastation. Pumping water out from under Antarctic glaciers to slow them down, solar radiation management to provide temporary reprieve from warming, direct air carbon capture and sequestration, even shadow government operations to *<strong>ahem\\</strong>* <em>disincentivize</em> carbon burners from doing what they do.</p>\n\n<p>There are certainly chapters that slow down into the weeds of, for example, economic policy that was way over my head, but it was still interesting and incomprehensible enough that I felt like I was learning about something new. I still can&#39;t tell you what quantitative easing is, but I know we might need to do it!</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve ever read anything else by KSR, you likely know he&#39;s an open socialist, so you can probably guess what his imagined future wherein we attempt to survive the climate crisis looks like.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re anything like me, constantly looking at the daily environmental news with abject horror as the situation grows worse, &quot;faster than expected&quot;, then I really encourage you to check this out. I&#39;m feeling more hopeful for my future than ever... and isn&#39;t that something science fiction is meant to do?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
