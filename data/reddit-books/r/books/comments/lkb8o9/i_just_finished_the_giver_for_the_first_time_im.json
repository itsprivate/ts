Tonight I finished The Giver for the first time after my best friend recommended it to me. I have never sobbed after reading a book before until tonight. I have never felt so much empathy for characters and so much heart ache after finishing a story. I am regretful of how many years I&#39;ve gone without reading, but I feel like this may have changed everything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
