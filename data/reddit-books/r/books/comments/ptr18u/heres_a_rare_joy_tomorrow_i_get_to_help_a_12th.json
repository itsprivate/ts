Since he&#39;s a D&amp;D player, I&#39;m thinking perhaps Pratchett might be a great place to start, or perhaps Garman&#39;s shorter stuff, or the Hitchhikers Guide... Oooh, or some of King&#39;s short stories? Hmmm. Could go Cyberpunk, and do Snow Crash, or Neuromancer...

Are there other qualities I should look for if I want to help a new reader have an amazing first experience?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
