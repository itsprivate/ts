Funny in a dry way, witty, deep understanding of human nature and the politics and schemes of his times. Love how Clavell wrote that man. Based on the historic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu\">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> I read.</p>\n\n<p>Found the beginning of the book a bit hard to get into but once you are in, you are locked in for good. I burned through the pages, fascinated at how the story evolved.</p>\n\n<p>Spoiler tag does not seem to work so I will just say that the death of one central character seemed a bit sudden, other than that no complaints.</p>\n\n<p>Also kind of crazy that Clavells horrible wartime experiences being captured and imprisoned in a Japanese war camp apparently produced a life long fascination with Japan and Asia and, among other things, this novel.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely recommended, a great book!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
