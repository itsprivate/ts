At the time, I put it down to menstruation being an \"inappropriate\" subject that simply couldn't be discussed in books aimed at young people. \n\nNow I'm starting to see the role that this plays in maintaining menstruation as a taboo subject. In movies and TV it's kind of excusable as stories are a lot more action-focused - you aren't shown so many mundane details of character's lives. In books however, where's your inside characters' heads all the time and know what they ate for breakfast and what their bedroom smells like, a hush-hush on menstruation becomes an elephant in the room. \n\nI'm not expecting teen novels to have deep introspection about what it means to be a woman, just the mundane acknowledgement that female characters menstruate. If she's roughing it in the woods for the night, she might need to improvise pads. If a 12-year-old girl is packing supplies for a long adventure, \"what if I start my period\" would almost definitely cross her mind. I feel like it's not really proper representation if something so integral is just...left out. \n\nDoes this bother you? Have you come across any Teen/YA books which handle it well?",
