It’d be like an aspiring musician that doesn’t listen to music—it just wouldn’t make any sense. Though, I was still reading at a very slow pace, most of my non work or writing time occupied with screen time. But then COVID hit, and my reading went through the absolute roof. I’ve read about 50+ books in the last year and I honestly can’t believe I never got into this before. There really is a magic about books that you can’t find anywhere else. Like an undiscovered treasure. I usually read between 1-3 hours a day, when before that time would just be occupied with numbing my mind. I turn on the PlayStation perhaps once every two weeks, and even then it’s only for about 40 minutes, just to keep our hands occupied while my friend and I talk. Otherwise, the TV is just a giant paperweight. \n\nI’m saying this to say that: reading is not dead, and while not nearly enough people are doing it IMO, it still has enough magic to pull someone away from the distractions of our modern world.
