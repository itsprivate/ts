I’m literally so hyped to start the next one.\nI hate Fudge. With a burning passion. He was always so nice to Harry and then suddenly at the end has a change of heart... what a prick. \nI loved the ending though; it makes me angry and excited at the same time because I know what’s to come. I can’t wait for when Sirius’ name is cleared and the order is reinstated :))</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the more I read, the more I’m enjoying the series. I’m starting Order of the Phoenix tonight. Hoping to finish all of them by the end of March. Then I can finish the rest of the books I have waiting for me 😅.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
