Since 2011, I have published over twenty novels in different genres, including contemporary to science fiction to fantasy. The main throughline for all of my books is that they are about queer people from all walks of life. In 2020, I released my first novel with Tor called The House in the Cerulean Sea. I also made my 2020 YA debut for Tor Teen in the novel, The Extraordinaries, a story about a fanboy with ADHD (like me!) who obsesses over the superheroes who protects his city, so much so that he writes fanfiction about them. Its sequel, Flash Fire, came out last month and will be followed by the third and final book in summer 2022. My upcoming novel, Under the Whispering Door, is about a selfish man named Wallace who dies and finds himself taken to a tea shop where a man named Hugo awaits. Hugo is a ferryman whose job it is to help souls cross to whatever comes next, but Wallace doesn&#39;t want to go, especially when he learns that the life he lived was not a good life at all.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2016, I have been writing full time, and while it was the scariest decision I&#39;ve ever made, it was also one of the best. I was fortunate enough to leave the corporate world behind to do what I love most. It hasn&#39;t always been easy, but I have never regretted this decision. Not many people get to say they do what they love, and I don&#39;t take that for granted. Also, working in a soul-sucking cubicle for an insurance company doesn&#39;t always spark creativity, so I was relieved to escape with my mind still mostly intact.</p>\n\n<p>Though I&#39;ve written in quite a few genres, I&#39;ve always felt most at home writing SFF. It&#39;s what I mostly read going up, and it&#39;s humbling that I get to contribute to the genre now. It&#39;s important for me to continue to help carve a space for marginalized voices in the SFF community. I love what I do, and I&#39;m so excited to continue telling queer stories with the backing of a great publisher who knows that our stories matter.</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/xe02bsb2rff71.jpg\">https://i.redd.it/xe02bsb2rff71.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
