It’s been almost a week, and I am almost finished (Happy dance), I found myself wanting to read more, and thinking “just one more chapter,” even though I really should go to bed. (just like I use to do as a teen.)\n\nI know myself well enough to know, that if I don’t keep working on it, I will just go back to getting books, I want to read, but in the end won’t get to read. I really do want to keep this up, so I have to thank you reddit, for giving me some will to try and find my love of reading again. \n\nThank You. \n\nAlso please let me know if you have redescovered books, and what helped you get back into it.",
