If you read them in that order I think it will give you a better sense of the era.  However, due to its length and other reasons I won’t divulge because I think you need to find out for yourselves, I give it a 3 out of 4.  I read it on Kindle, but I am going to buy the hardback as a trophy that I read it, which I never do.  Good luck.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
