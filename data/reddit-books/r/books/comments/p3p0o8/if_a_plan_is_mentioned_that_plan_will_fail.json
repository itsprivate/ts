But lately, I can&#39;t help but notice this trend across books, TV, and movies. If a character explains or mentions their plans, either outwardly to other characters or expressed as internal monologue to the audience, those plans will almost always fail miserably. On the other hand, plans tend to work perfectly when they are put into action secretly and the audience learns them as they unfold. </p>\n\n<p>Again, I know this is done to add a &quot;twist&quot; or surprise the audience with an unexpected victory or defeat. But now it&#39;s doing just the opposite for me. While reading, the instant a character starts to explain a plan or battle strategy, I make an immediate assumption that something bad is about to happen. It takes away some of my enjoyment of the story, because rather than paying close attention to the plan itself, I&#39;m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also frustrating because I&#39;m a writer myself, and I honestly don&#39;t have an easy alternative to offer. Am I the only one who rolls their eyes when someone starts explaining a strategy?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
