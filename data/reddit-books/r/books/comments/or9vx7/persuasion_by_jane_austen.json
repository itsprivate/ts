Personally I was deeply impressed by this book for a number of reasons. For one thing, I feel that it was a very meaningful satire on class and social inequality, written at a time when many people were even more classist than they are today. I also thought that it was very moving, without being openly emotional or manipulative. It is impressive how compelling the romance was, considering that the protagonist and her love interest barely talk for most of the novel - something which also reflects gender relations at the time. </p>\n\n<p>But most of all I was really impressed by the the language. I am aware that it’s not a minority view to say that Austen was a good stylist, but what strikes me is how beautiful yet easy to read her sentences are. It really is different from the way in which a romantic novel would be written today - it asks more of the reader in a sense, but it gives more too. </p>\n\n<p>I would certainly like to discuss the book further with anyone willing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
