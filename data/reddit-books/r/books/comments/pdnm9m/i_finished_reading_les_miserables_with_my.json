When she became older, reading Les Mis was always on the top of her bucket list as multiple of her friends were reading it and she wanted to read a novel that was based where she once lived. She finally got to it in her elderly years and was making great progress (she was about 400 pages in) when she had a sudden stroke and was rushed to the hospital, where she remained for some time. Once she was well enough to go home and live with a caretaker, I took it upon myself to help her finish what she had started and read Les Miserables to her on the phone whenever she was feeling well enough that day to listen. We finished reading it just yesterday, and I’m so happy that I could help her with a long term goal. She’s one of the strongest women I know and I’m so happy I could bond with her even more this way!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
