Because what the modern western love story has done is conditioned us to feel this way.\n\nMishima, in masterful fashion, demonstrated that there's more to the love story than what we've learned to expect. What seemed to me to be a declining genre was completely renewed. In only 181 pages, *The Sound of Waves* manages to convey the thoughts of so many authors, without the tropes i've come to expect.\n\nThere's so much more to this book, however. Without going into too much detail, the importance of ideals such as patience, persistence, and willpower are heavily emphasized throughout the text. Even some of the ideas of the coming of age story manage to find their way into the pages. *The Sound of Waves* manages to fit the themes of so many genres into so few pages, and i'm astonished at Mishima's ability to have pulled it off. I highly recommend this book for anyone who hasn't read it thus far.",
