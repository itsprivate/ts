It made me appreciate the freedom of choice that I have.\n\nIt's easy not to appreciate things in life, like having someplace to sleep, having something to eat everyday, having at least one person to call family.\n\nIt's easy not to appreciate the smaller things in life, like your mother saying good-morning to you with a smile, like the cup of tea and a good book that is just so perfect on a cold night.\n\nIt's easy to sit in the comfort of your home and mind and think you have it worse than everybody else and that you're more miserable.\n\nWhen I read a book, it's like I step *outside*. I step outside the comfort of my house with the food and the family. Outside of my life. I see how other people really have it hard, how it's like to have problems way worse than just my sick mind.\n\nI love reading. It is not just a hobby anymore. I get to live many different lives, see things from other people's perspective, live in the real world without stepping outside, and most importantly, get out of my head.\n\nI love it.",
