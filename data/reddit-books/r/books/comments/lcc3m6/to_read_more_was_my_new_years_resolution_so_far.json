This subreddit continues to motivate and offer up new books to explore.\n\nThe Iliad\n\nWanted to read it because I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Odyssey in High School. I felt it fell short in comparison. A great read if you like war and are interested in Homer but I feel it’s themes were too narrow. The battle scenes were long and drawn on and the listing of regiments was particularly odd. Overall a great read but I expected more having loved The Odyssey.\n\nPride and Prejudice \n\nI decided to read this because I’m a sucker for romance movies and wanted to see if a book had the same effect. The novel exceeded my expectations and delved into interesting themes of classes and sisterhood. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.\n\nThank you all!",
