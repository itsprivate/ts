It follows a young German soldier through his life at the front lines and paints some of the most emotionally charging imagery I’ve ever read in any story. </p>\n\n<p>The way he describes death, feelings, context of the war and other situations is incredibly poetic.  Sometimes I would finish a sentence or a chapter and have to pause and reflect on the points Remarque is making. </p>\n\n<p>The way the story ended was gut wrenching too. The story talks about the deeply vibrant feelings and emotions and experiences that a young soldier goes through, talking about deep philosophical concepts. Yet on the day he dies, the bulletin reads “All Quiet On the Western Front”, echoing the theme of the wastes of war and how it never considers the individual. </p>\n\n<p>Incredible.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
