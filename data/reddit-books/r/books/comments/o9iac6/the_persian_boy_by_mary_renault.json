The story follows Bagoas, a eunuch gifted as a servant to Alexander the Great not long after his great victory over Darius of Persia.  Bagoas is a real historical person who gets only occasional mention in the records of Alexander’s life.</p>\n\n<p>The book is a wonder.  The prose is accessible while also being lyrical and even poetic at times.  The scope is astounding, allowing the reader to see Alexander’s campaigns firsthand.  And Bagoas is a sensitive, thoughtful, and sympathetic figure amidst the cruelty and splendor of the ancient world.</p>\n\n<p>The portrait of Alexander himself is the real treat here though, in my opinion.  The book shows us a nuanced yet extraordinary character who is heroic, flawed, loving, and a visionary leader.  This is one of those stories in which knowing how it ends takes nothing away from the journey.  </p>\n\n<p>10/10</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
