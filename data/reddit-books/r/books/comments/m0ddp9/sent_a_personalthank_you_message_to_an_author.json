Reading a novel is such an elective enterprise—after all no one HAS to read a novel—that a writer is always gratified to know that his work has repaid a reader’s time.  I’m very happy to learn that Rider in the Rain has done that for you.\n \nYou might be surprised to hear, even in this age of email and social media, that novelists don’t receive very much communication from their readers.  Why this is so is anyone’s guess, but I suspect most readers are too shy or intimidated to write to an author they favor.  I suppose they’d be startled to learn that writers put on their pants one leg at a time just like everyone else.  For that reason I’m doubly grateful that you made the effort to write.  Also, I’m especially pleased that you’ve done so for Rider in the Rain, because this book is a personal favorite of mine.  Every now and then a novelist feels fairly certain that he’s gotten every pitch right over the plate, as I feel with this one, and so your generous remarks are especially meaningful.\n \nI’m attaching a photo as a little souvenir for you of your experience with reading Rider in the Rain.  This is the make and model of revolver that Madero uses in the final shootout.  There are many fine modern copies available (I have one and it’s a pleasure to shoot), but the gun in the photo is a fully operational original from the 1870s and is part of my collection.  The tally marks/notches, four on both grip plates, are very old and of unknown origin.  \n \nAgain, thank you for taking the time and trouble to write, and please accept my very best wishes and warm regards.\n\nSincerely,\nBill Altimari\n\n\n(Made my week. What a great, down to earth guy)",
