If you haven’t read his works- he’s the Michelangelo of words. </p>\n\n<p>I ordered a new copy of The Midnight Palace from Amazon. It was supposed to be delivered within 72 hours of purchase date. It didn’t arrive. There was no tracking number available through Amazon. I contacted the seller and was informed they didn’t have the book in stock and had to request the book from an international partner. They said to give it a week and contact them if it didn’t arrive. </p>\n\n<p>A week passed and I was preparing to request a refund. Low and behold, I get a text that it’s in the US and en route to my home, albeit late, but better late than never. When it finally arrived, I looked at the invoice first and saw that the book was listed “used-like new”. I was disappointed initially because I wanted an unread copy. I check out the book, examining for signs of damage or wear. There was a smudge on the first blank page before the title page. I flip that page and my eye is drawn to a blue ink scribble on the title page. I was upset- I thought someone tested a pen on the title page. Then, my eyes adjusted and examined the whole title page…</p>\n\n<p>… I received an autographed, limited first edition copy by sheer luck/happenstance. I’ve never been so elated as realizing that one of my literary idols held that book in his hands. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this if you did. I was just so happy, I had to share.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
