I finished it recently and it is one of the most challenging novels I’ve ever read.\n\nWhen I only read for a bit or tried to rush myself, nothing would register because of the manic writing style and jumps in the story. But when I took my time, I really got into it and it became a very funny book. I think this short passage illustrates it well: \n\n‘Nature instantly ebb’d again, — the film returned to its place, — the pulse fluttered — stopp’d — went on — throb’d — stopp’d again — moved — stopp’d — shall I go on? — No.’\n\nIt also feels astonishingly modern. It was first fully published in 1767, but it’s full of these jokes and characters that felt like something out of Beckett or a Coen Brothers movie. The main character sets out to tell his life story but doesn’t get to his date of birth until past the half-way point and his uncle is so obsessed with fortifications that he’s almost unable to talk about anything else.\n\nThe introduction by Christopher Ricks gives an interesting background: “Certainly the rise of the novel was a great achievement, but Sterne seems to have been one of the first to realize that a novelist, just because he was indeed creating, might be tempted to think himself endued with godlike powers of scrutiny. So instead of the omniscient, omnipotent narrator humorously deployed by Fielding, Sterne substitutes the vague half-knowledge and frustrated impotence of  Tristram.”\n\nTo finish with a quote from the novel: ‘L—d! said my mother, what is all this story about? - A COCK and a BULL, said Yorick — And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard’",
