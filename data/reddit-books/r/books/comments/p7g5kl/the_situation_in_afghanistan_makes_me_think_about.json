That’s how I spent my lasik surgery recovery at the beginning of 2019. </p>\n\n<p>It’s a fantastic memoir about an American woman (Betty) who meets and falls in love with a charming Iranian doctor (“Moody”) who is living and practicing in the US. They married and had a daughter (Mahtob). When Mahtob is four years old, Moody convinces Betty to come with Mahtob on a two week vacation to Iran so that his family can meet Mahtob. She agrees and upon arrival discovers that Moody has returned to his Muslim Shiite faith. Moody decides that they are all going to stay in Iran and Betty suffers the abuse of being a foreigner and a woman in post-revolution Iran. The book is the harrowing story of their experience in and escape from Iran back to America. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know much about the histories of Iran or Afghanistan, but I’ve heard that they have similar experiences. Iran used to be a very liberal country before the revolution. Women wore western clothing like shorts, attended university, were granted the right to vote and be elected to parliament, etc. After the revolution women lost these rights, were repressed beyond the loss of these rights, and had a strict dress code enforced upon them in which they were required to wear a chador and could not wear open toe shoes in public. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, while this book isn’t about Afghanistan I think it gives a similar but separate insight into what’s happening in Afghanistan and why Afghan women especially are afraid. If nothing else, it’s a great book that’s worth a read.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
