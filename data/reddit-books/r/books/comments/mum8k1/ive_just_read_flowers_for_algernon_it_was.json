Charlie’s descent into the inevitable end was as painful as it was predictable (an odd combination of phrases, I know,) and executed in a perfect hopelessness.

And more specifically, dementia. But more than anything, I feel dejection and an emotional tethering to this book. \n\nIn a short comment: the book in it’s entirely was, of course, fantastic as well.
