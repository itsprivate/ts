Of course I read other books, both for fun and for education purposes but my pleasure reading mostly consisted of YA. Recently though I was feeling stagnant. In a reading slump, if you will. </p>\n\n<p>Well recently I went on a plane for the first time and knew I was gonna be bored as shit so I downloaded a bunch of thrillery books (think Gillian Flynn) and basically just binged them all. It was the first time I felt truly engaged in a book in a while. The style/content/characters just clicked. Now I kind of feel like I don’t want to go back.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else experienced something similar? I would love to hear your stories!</p>\n\n<p>Also sorry for any mistakes, I’m on mobile and am the world’s most incompetent keyboard user.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
