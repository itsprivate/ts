Her writing of course is brilliant but I feel such heart ache knowing this happened. I live in Europe (a country not responsible for colonialism btw) and in school we don't look at the impact of colonialism, the fall out of what atrocities took place outside of Europe. I knew about the genocide in Uganda and the famine in Ethiopia on superficial levels; I even knew about the State of Biafra but as facts not in this deeply emotional contextualised way. I watched Adam Curtis documentaries \"can't get you out of my head\" and I see the same way now Nigeria was impacted by Britain making a departure like other countries, creating defacto rulers like in Iraq. But the difference with Ngozi's words and story is I feel such a deep sadness for the suffering described compared to historical and political facts. Her writing is so compelling I have been reading the context around the history, looking up maps of the different states and tribal areas of Nigeria. She truly connects her readers to her words I think.\n\nEdit\n\nThanks for the award :)",
