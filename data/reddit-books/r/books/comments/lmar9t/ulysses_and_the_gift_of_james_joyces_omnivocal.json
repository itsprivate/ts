Joyce has a kind of weird talent of being able to be all voices of all characters by eschewing the traditional conventions of narration and dialogue. I had not paid attention to it before but now I find it really interesting. \n\nJoyce seems to be using the voice of each character to reveal things about the other characters that he / she is talking to, while at the same time revealing the true voice and true emotional state of the character doing the speaking and observing and acting. It’s hard to even write about what Joyce is doing. It is pure duende, to borrow Lorca’s term. He is able to say almost all things at once, and even say things you don’t think he is saying, only to find out later, in having to go back and read it that he was saying those things and alluding to those things a long time ago. The internal monologue of the characters also seems to give us a wide range of bits of information about the geography and scenery around the character, which play a role as a character as well. Dublin seems to act like a narrator, in a way, revealing things through character observation that tell us a lot about history, ideas, culture and psychology. \n\nIt’s like looking at a painting and the effects of shading and light. Each little fragment of speech, or “thought bubble” that drifts up is able to display memory, action, intention, mood, and hesitations and motivations all at the same time. I remember reading some of these depictions in college, and now, about 15 years later, I look at them and think, “How did I miss some of this rich detail?” \n\nWould it be worth it to read Joyce’s letters to find out more about his positions on narration and fiction? Does he write much about it personally and reveal much to others about what he was trying to do with Ulysses? I am aware that he talked to Pound and Eliot about this a great deal, and I was wondering, beyond just any scraps of his letters or diary reflections in regards to those conversations, has any biographer done a decent job of exegesis on those? I am so far out of the university life that I never really tracked who his best biographers are, and I don’t even know if anyone like Howard Bloom even wrote about him, though I think Bloom really stuck to American writers, I thought. \n\nAny help Would be great: Letters, diaries, biographies of thE great man. I feel like so much of how he writes is present in the way we see cinema and art and fiction today. It’s such a fantastic book to sit and read during an entire afternoon. Thanks.",
