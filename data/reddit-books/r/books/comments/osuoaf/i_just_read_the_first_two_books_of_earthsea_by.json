First, no spoiler talk if you&#39;re reading this post but haven&#39;t read the books. The first, <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em>, didn&#39;t grab my attention as soon as I started reading it, as I felt like the storytelling was a whole lot of telling and very little showing, but I quickly powered through until I was eventually engrossed in the story. What made it click is when I realised that this book would be really good to read out loud to someone else. On the other hand, the second book, <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em>, grabbed my attention from the very start and I loved every single page of it. I won&#39;t discuss the third yet because I&#39;m not done reading it, but I really wanted to share my thoughts on the first two.</p>\n\n<p>From here on out, there be spoilers, may this be your warning.</p>\n\n<p>The tale of Ged, Sparrowhawk, became interesting only after he summoned the shadow, in my opinion. Before that, it was a lot of setup, but little substance. Still, Ged&#39;s character arc is well realised and he, as a character, grew on me rather fast after the incident. I really like how the conflict in this book rarely goes into combat, and even when it does it&#39;s rather brief and is never the ultimate solution to whatever problem is at hand. I interpreted Ged&#39;s conflict with his own shadow as representing his growth out of his juvenile arrogance, as at first, when faced with the consequences of it, he takes refuge from his shame in excessive humbleness, even giving up on his dreams, ambitions and talents, but ultimately the real solution isn&#39;t to destroy the shadow that embodies his past arrogance, but to embrace it, recognising that it was a part of who he is and learn from the experience going forward. It&#39;s not the most complex thing in the world, but I really enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<p>However, the second book is where things get really good. Ged may be a very likeable character, but he&#39;s not particularly complex or nuanced. But Tenar? I think Tenar is a great character, extremely well rounded and full of nuance, a lot of it unspoken, merely shown through her actions. Her tale gripped me from the very start and never let go until the book was over. Not all of her actions are good, but that&#39;s not a bad thing because we get to see the psychological burden that doing those things placed on her. Also, we really get to explore the effect on her mind and feelings of the indoctrination that she got from a very young age by being grown in a literal cult of death. Seeing Ged again is very welcome, but Tenar is the absolute star of the show. The mystery and suspence in this book are top notch. Tenar gets to be a very strong and yet vulnerable character, who is prisoner of her circumstances but eventually breaks free by realising that she can exercise her own agency through compassion.</p>\n\n<p>Thumbs up all around, especially considering the landscape of fantasy literature when she wrote these books. I can&#39;t wait to read the rest.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
