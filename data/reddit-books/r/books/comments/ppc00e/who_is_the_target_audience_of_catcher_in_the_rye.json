  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Today was the second day of my AP Lang class (I’m a junior in hs) and my teacher was explaining primary and secondary audiences. He started off with an example, asking us if The Catcher in the Rye was written for us. Everyone shook their head, but I raised my hand to disagree. When he called on me, I said “it could be,” but he immediately interjected and said it wasn’t. \nHis next example was asking if Romeo and Juliette was written for us as the primary audience, which I clearly agreed it wasn’t. He never did end up defining the two target audiences, only going as far as to say(/joke?) that Shakespeare er so I’m not sure what they wrote it because he wanted money. \nI wanted to argue that The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel that helps teenagers in finding a relatable character who has similar struggles with the confusing time of adolescence. When I read it (for school) two years ago, I found Holden extremely relatable and I really liked him. I know there are many teens and adults who despise him and think he’s annoying/selfish/you name it. To me, I think that he’s flawed for sure, but that’s what makes him such a compelling character. Is this not written for teens as the target audience? What makes a target audience in either case, and what’s the difference between primary and secondary? Who would be the primary audience for Catcher then?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I would like to clarify that I am not blaming my teacher for anything at all. He’s a well experienced teacher and is already becoming my favorite after three days of school. I’m sure a lot of the confusion in my post is my misunderstanding or misinterpretation, not his. We’ve only had two classes but I already really like how my teacher thinks and I’ve agreed with many of his opinions. I also didn’t mean to make him sound rude by cutting me off — I’m sure he had his reasons to. I think I’ll email him today, asking for clarification.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
