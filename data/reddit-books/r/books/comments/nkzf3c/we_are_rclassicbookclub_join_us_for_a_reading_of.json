We are a small reading community called [r/ClassicBookClub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicBookClub/), and we read and discuss a chapter of a classic book each day in a dedicated spoiler free discussion thread.\n\nOur readers nominate and vote on the books we read, and the winning book for our next read is The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. We are coming to the end of our current reading and will begin The Picture of Dorian Gray on May 31st.\n\nPinned at the top of our subreddit is the Announcement post for the Dorian Gray reading.\n\nOur first rule for books that we read is they must be in the public domain and we provide links to free versions from Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, and audiobooks from Librivox. We also have a link to a dramatic reading from Librivox which should be fun!\n\nReaders are free to choose whichever medium they want, and read in any language they are comfortable with.\n\nIn our sidebar you’ll find links for our current book, our rules, a link to our discussion archive, and links to our family of subreddits.\n\nWe just hit 1300 subscribers and would love to keep growing. So if reading one chapter of classic literature a day and discussing it with a group of fellow readers interests you, then come check us out.\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know, and I wish you all happy reading!",
