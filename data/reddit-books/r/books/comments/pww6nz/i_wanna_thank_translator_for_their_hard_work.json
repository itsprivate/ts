Sometimes it even adds up quality to the original book, specially when it was written in far different written system and specific cultures. Translator notes can add quite a bit of context that sometimes can&#39;t be expressed through the use of english that would be lost to some readers. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It comes to mind good translations of Arabian Nights(the translations from multiple arabic sources, not the french one that was spread around here in south america). I can&#39;t begin to imagine how life was around north africa and middle east in 2021, let alone hundreds of years ago. Context adds up so much value in such stories that it blows my mind. </p>\n\n<p>Also with languages that deviates from mine (I speak tupi[a native south american language], portuguese and english) so much that a direct translation proves itself almost impossible. Japanese is a good exemple of translation that requires lots of context because of its framework, so I am always pleased to read the implication of the use of kanji in setences.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post, I&#39;m just an indigenous Brazilian trying to learn about other cultures.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>tldr; we should value good translations and translators are MVPs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
