Cried about a dozen times. </p>\n\n<p>For context, I&#39;ve been in iso on and off since March 2020. I was a student at a foreign university before Covid hit, and I had to leave it all behind and come home. I&#39;ve mostly been alone since, and my country is currently in the middle of a terrible third wave. </p>\n\n<p>This book was so very sad, cathartic and beautiful. I came of age in the 2010s, when post-apocalyptic fiction was all the rage. But many such works got lost in the spectacle of destruction (2012, Divergent). They did not pay enough attention to the countless tiny unspeakable implications of societal collapse. </p>\n\n<p>Station Eleven, however, depicts an &#39;apocalypse&#39; (a pandemic that kills nearly everyone on earth) through the eyes of a handful of people who survived, died before or perished during it. Mandel reflects on the beauty and fragility of the societal structures we take for granted despite tethering our lives and identities to them. She shows their devastating collapse makes the case for why &#39;surviving isn&#39;t enough&#39;. Her characters make and enjoy art, they preserve beautiful things for no reason but their beauty, they create communities and hold on to their <em>humanness</em> amidst the post-apocalyptic desolation.</p>\n\n<p>During COVID, I lost time and joy and loved ones. This book made me appreciate and want to hold tight to those things and people that still remain.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
