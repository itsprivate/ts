The 14th book in the series is just about to be released and I highly recommend the series, it gets a lot darker and smarter after the first 3 or 4 books.\n\nAnyway. He also wrote this YA horror/fantasy trilogy and OH MY GOD. It is so much creepier than anything I've ever read by Stephen King or any other horror writer. The trilogy is called *Demon Road* and it's about a girl who goes on the run after she discovers her parents are demons who need to kill and eat her in order to uphold their end of a bargain with a  demon. It's smart, it's witty, it's scary and it has a ticking clock element as well as demons. I just think it's a piece of art and I love it and if anyone was looking for a recommendation this is my contribution",
