I came across it again about 3 years ago, and haven't been able to let go of it since.\n\nWhat works so well about it, for me, is William Gibson's stubborn refusal to describe any of the innumerable pieces of jargon and tech lingo for us, evoking a sense of why these things are there but leaving them purposefully vague. But I guess that works to the book's advantage because it seems to have dated so little almost 30 years later, keeping the future of 2035 mystical, and even bringing words like 'cyberspace' and 'matrix' into everyone's minds. The world he presents is so vivid - particularly the tactile imagery he's able to invoke.\n\nIt's such a forward-thinking book that its perception of how society may use AI could still be ahead of its time, even if we could share its Gibson's concerns of the tech being too smart for its own good. Perhaps we may be able to see parallels to plot points in the novel spring to life a few decades from now. Makes me think how early we all might be to see the action, to quote an exchange from the book: \"That what she wanted?\" \"No, she couldn't imagine what I'd be like.\"\n\nTo those who want to read the book but don't have much time to sit down with it, I highly recommend the [audiobook on YouTube, narrated by Arthur Addison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAmurh7HqWI). In its own way, the audiobook fits the novel's aesthetic, with the cassette hum and gli-gli-glitching of some words.\n\nI also wanted to share a [concept trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSYb4w7fBbc) I made for the novel to try and capture the impression it had left on me.
