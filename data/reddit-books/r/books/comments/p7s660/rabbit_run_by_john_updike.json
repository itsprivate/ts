I had been reading &quot;Moneyball&quot; by Michael Lewis, and at one point he mentioned that he wanted to write as well as John Updike. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing as how that book was about MLB, I got into my audible app, and chose the Updike title that had a basketball on the cover, foolishly assuming that I was on the trail of some kind of highschool basketball expostion. I thought at least it was sports-centric. </p>\n\n<p>I could not have been more incorrect. This book tore my heart out. </p>\n\n<p>Meet 26 year old Harry Angstrom, despicable fool, and protagonist of this emotional meat-grinder of an American novel. He is a former highschool basketball phenom, who grows up into a dead end job, a kid, and a young and intoxicated wife pregnant with the next. </p>\n\n<p>The story is essentially a morality tale that gets straight to the corruption, and inconstancy of the main character. He is a coward and a terrible father. Consumed in self interest and shallow regard for his wife, he just runs away... </p>\n\n<p>Without saying anything else about the plot, I just want to say how good of a writer John Updike is. He is the best American author in my opinion. Im American, live in CA, and i usually prefer English literature, but Updike might be the most naturally talented writer I have ever come across. His knowledge and expression of the human condition is unmatched. This book was perfect. It was perfectly concise. It&#39;s meaning was perfectly true and heartbreaking.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
