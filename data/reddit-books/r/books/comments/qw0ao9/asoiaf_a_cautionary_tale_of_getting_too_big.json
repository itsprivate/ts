After book 3, when there were still many plots and sub plots dangling, rather than tying up those loose ends GRRM introduced more, so much so i had to read a wiki page on all the major and minor plots going on. GRRM sometimes joked in interviews he may have done too much but now i&#39;m thinking it might be true. Its like the Hydra, you cut off one head and another appears well GRRM adding one more thing and two more things need to appear. You can only juggle so many things in a story before you can properly handle them. Its still one of the best series i&#39;ve ever read, and i don&#39;t regret reading them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
