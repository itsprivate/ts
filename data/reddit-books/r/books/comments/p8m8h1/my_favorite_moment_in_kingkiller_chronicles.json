In fact, my favorite scene in the series and one of my all time favorite moments in any book is in Wise Man&#39;s Fear. In chapter 7 Kvothe has been drugged making him emotionally unstable. This results in him hiding in his room, being emotionally tortured by the memories of his happy childhood. He&#39;s quietly crying when Auri makes a surprise visit and immediately understands that he&#39;s being overwhelmed by the emotions he&#39;s feeling. The ones he never dealt with or faced fully. </p>\n\n<p>The scene is short, and consists entirely of Auri comforting Kvothe while he&#39;s falling apart. He tells her he misses his mom, and shares a story of the two of them singing together when he was a baby, ending by saying that he&#39;s never going to see her again and fully giving into the ocean of grief in his heart.</p>\n\n<p>And the chapter ends with Auri simply saying, &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here. You&#39;re safe.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just such a quiet, beautiful moment which says so much about Auri and Kvothe. Auri knowing fully the grief that he deals with, and immediately comforting him the moment she realizes what&#39;s happening. Kvothe and the constant momentum of his life and story pushing aside the ability to grieve in any healthy way, making him emotionally stunted and withdrawn all the way up to the present day. It&#39;s a heartbreaking scene because the grief feels so real, and it hurts all the more knowing that Auri has likely suffered to at least a similar degree, and yet there&#39;s beauty in their friendship, and in the way they will immediately comfort each other, and help each other through their misery when it becomes overwhelming. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I loved it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
