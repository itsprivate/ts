At night, I&#39;d stay up way later than I should because I just couldn&#39;t stop. But as I got older and busier, I kinda... stopped. I&#39;m an aspiring screenwriter, so my attention turned towards films and TV-shows. My writing also became almost exclusively centered around screenplays. Now, I struggle to read books. I get bored quickly. So I thought my days of being a reader were over.</p>\n\n<p>But this book... for the first time in years, I couldn&#39;t put the book down. I read during meals, late at night, all the things I used to do as a kid. Suddenly, reading was no longer difficult, and I pretty much devoured the book. I don&#39;t know if this was the start of me rediscovering books or just an outlier, but regardless I&#39;m glad I got to experience this.</p>\n\n<p>This book is awe-inspiring. It gets the excitement of discovery across so well. It doesn&#39;t follow the typical story structure either. Most of this is just discovering new stuff and figuring out how it works, and it&#39;s perfect, even though it&#39;s so different from my usual style. I love sci-fi, but usually I tend to prefer soft sci-fi with lasers, space battler and giant mechs, or at least adrenaline-filled intense space movies where the main characters are always on the verge of death. And while there&#39;s some of the latter in here, it&#39;s really not the focus. Funny how <em>this</em> was the book to end my long reading hiatus.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, it gave me Outer Wilds vibes, even though it&#39;s a completely different medium. It&#39;s the only piece of media I consumed that was so exciting in how it treated scientific discoveries.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
