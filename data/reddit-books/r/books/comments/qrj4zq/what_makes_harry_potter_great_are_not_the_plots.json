Whereas the books, without any time and budget restrictions, can go in on much more detail.</p>\n\n<p>I was initially hesitant as an adult to give time to books meant for children and teens but my opinion changed early on. Not only do the books mature as they progress, they are also pretty fun to read. Interestingly, for me the plots and the magic/wizardry were unimpressive. Each book is a mystery where someone is trying to kill or hurt Harry and only Harry and his gang can solve the riddle. The magical aspect is mostly by the number and world building is okay. </p>\n\n<p>Where the books shine are during the mundane moments in between the bigger, plot-driving moments. This includes the class room lectures, the character interactions between the main trio, the Great Hall dinner scenes, the common room discussions, the banters with Malfoy and his gang, Fred and George being clever fools,  the train journey to Hogwarts etc. JK Rowling has written these characters well with nuance and interesting traits but not without their faults. </p>\n\n<p>The setting of Hogwarts is another positive. A huge castle which acts as a boarding school hidden from the outside world, with a lot of history as well as magical shenanigans aplenty. It makes you weirdly nostalgic for Hogwarts even if our school experiences are vastly different from Harry Potter&#39;s.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
