Especially about the not being able to comprehend oneself&#39;s death, even though it&#39;s an inevitability for us all.</p>\n\n<p>I have really enjoyed how Tolstoy takes completely mundane, normal characters and makes the reader so invested and interested in them. Even when nothing exceptional is actually happening to them. How he describes thoughts and feelings is so accurate that you can&#39;t help but relate, even if you don&#39;t actually like the characters.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear other people&#39;s thoughts and experiences on this story!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
