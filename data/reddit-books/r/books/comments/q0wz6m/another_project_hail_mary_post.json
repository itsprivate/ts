I think sci fi similar to historical fiction in a way. There’s a spectrum of extremely well-researched and detailed such that you feel fully-immersed, all the way to “that doesn’t even make sense.”  I usually struggle to keep my mouth shut during sci fi movies (I’m looking at you, Gravity and Life). There were just a few minor parts where I disagreed with Weir and one large science plot point. Basically, the book science porn. </p>\n\n<p>Next, the emotional aspect but from the point of view of a scientist. I see too many story lines where the scientist is driven by a love interest. I think that does a large disservice to scientists who dedicate their lives to science and are as deeply passionate about their subject as they are about their partners. I’m SO happy to take the journey of a story not because of a love interest. </p>\n\n<p>The characters. I see some criticism about many characters being one-dimensional. Sure, some ancillary aren’t developed. But Rocky. Omg Rocky. One of my favorite things about sci fi is that it can be a sort of mirror of humanity, with exaggerations where the author wants to draw attention to certain aspects of human nature. Rocky exemplifies that beautifully. Wier does a decent job of explaining why Rocky’s race has enough convenient similarities to humans to make a decent story line. </p>\n\n<p>I have never cried out of happiness during a book before.  I did that today when I finished the audiobook!</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the audiobook was great!  I especially loved Rocky’s voice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
