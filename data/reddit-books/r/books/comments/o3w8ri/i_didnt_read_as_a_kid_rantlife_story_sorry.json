I avoided reading at all costs until my 11th grade English class. \n\nWhen I was a kid I didn’t particularly like the books that my older sister and dad liked, and when I did show interest in a book they would make fun of me and scoff at my terrible taste in reading (I was 8 years old). I learned quickly that if I didn’t read books my “taste” in books couldn’t be criticized. I avoided reading like the plague. Through elementary and middle school my parents worried that I was illiterate and I got teased for being a slow reader, so I just cut it out of my life more and more. \n\nIt wasn’t until my 11th grade English class (no AP lit for me) that I found a love for reading. My teacher let us read any book we wanted and gave us the first 10 minutes of class to read every day. I started with youth books. It was a bit embarrassing, but it was what I was comfortable with. It was slow going at first, I didn’t know what I liked and there was some serious trial and error finding it, but when I did it caught like wildfire. I read 32 books that first year, probably more pages than I had read in my entire life leading up to that. \n\nI felt- and still feel- a lot of resentment and sadness over what I missed. I read Percy Jackson recently and I can only wonder how much more I would have liked it if I had only read it when I was 12. I have a section of my “to read” list dedicated to these books that I missed. I don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by reading them. \n\nDuring quarantine I lost momentum, but Harry Potter brought it back (jk Rowling’s Twitter meltdown happened right after I finished book 5) that year I read 59 books. Now in 2021 I have hit my stride. It’s fun to look back at the super rapid evolution that I underwent. From youth, to ya, to adult (and back to YA, lol), each book felt like the best one ever until I moved onto the next. I am overjoyed that I can truthfully say that I love reading. It was a long time in the works but I have made it.\n\nI’m even minoring in English for college and I’m an engineer! If I told my younger self that, she would never believe me.",
