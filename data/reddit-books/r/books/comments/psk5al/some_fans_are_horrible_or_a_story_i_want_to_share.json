I was just wrapping up the available Wheel of Time books and wanted another big fantasy series. I checked out the first book from the library, loved it, and eventually bought paperbacks for all the books; I read the series to completion after that. </p>\n\n<p>After some years had gone by and the series was concluded, I found myself moving across the country  and was paring down every thing, including my beloved massive home library. One of the things I sold was my paperback collection of Goodkind books. The lady who bought them told me this story about how her son was in the military, stationed halfway around the world, and he loved fantasy novels, so she was excited to get them for him. </p>\n\n<p>I thought, hey, that&#39;s cool. Lemme go share it. </p>\n\n<p>Social media was still in its infancy and only up and coming and self-published authors were on it. Most established and &quot;big name&quot; writers had forums on their websites for fans to interact. I headed over to TG&#39;s website, posted up this story, and went about my day. The next day I looked at the responses and wow...TG fans were mad at me. Like, really mad. They attacked me for &quot;stealing&quot; from Terry, not supporting him and his books by being a &quot;second hand dealer&quot; and so on. Even the site/forum&#39;s mod...a rather notorious assholes as I later learned...accused me of being a &quot;socialist thief&quot; and compared me to some of the villains in the series. Then banned me. </p>\n\n<p>That put a damper on TG and his books for me for awhile and then the more I looked into the whole Objectivist thing and actually bothered to learn about Ayn Rand...well, she wasn&#39;t exactly a saint herself. </p>\n\n<p>Well, there is is, good people of Reddit. Just an experience I brought up while reminiscing with an old buddy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
