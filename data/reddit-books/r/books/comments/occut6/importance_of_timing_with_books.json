For example one of my favorite books is The Catcher In The Rye, which I read at 19. I wouldn’t recommend the book to anyone much older than that, a lot of people don’t like the book “especially on this thread” and I get that. Another example is the first time I read “One Flew Over the Cookoo’s Nest” I read that at 16 and didn’t really get it. I re-read it recently and in the context of the world today understand williningly going into an asylum. I was wondering if anyone else had other books that can be hit or miss depending on the reader?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
