This genuinely perplexes me. I don’t mean this as a critic but why does that matter? Nor am I trying to blanket say that my taste is better but in none of my favourite works of fiction would I say that I identify with the characters (except in a few specific examples, and then only briefly). I do like the character of Odysseus for his cunning and charisma but also acknowledge him to be a blood soaked trickster and not a particularly nice person. Crash by J.G. Ballard is one of my favourite novels but I don’t actually identify with people who are sexually aroused by car accidents. Orlando in Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name is something of a spoilt and neglectful aristocrat entirely focused upon their own wants and whims and yet I love the book.\nWhy then do others feel they have to like and identify with characters?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
