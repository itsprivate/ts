I wanted to know how anyone who grew up reading Goosebumps thinks if it affected them in any certain way.\n\nMy school had a well equipped library and I did a lot of my initial reading there, where I mostly read Enid Blyton (famous five, secret seven) and a whole lot of goosebumps. I think I was around 10 - 11 at that time. As I have grown up, I have always been fascinated by the horror genre and though I am somewhat of an easy scare (I generally cower in fear during any tense scene in a movie) though I still am always excited to watch horror movies. Idk how much Goosebumps has affected this, though I think it prepared or even instilled the curiosity of the bizarre and unknown. I don't particularly feel they are too graphic for kids and don't think it should be withheld from kids. \n\nSo my question is whether you would want your kids to read goosebumps and how you think reading Goosebumps in your childhood has affected you in any way Or how it might affect kids in general?",
