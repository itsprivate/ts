It&#39;s as though Danielewski condensed terror out of literally nothing but anxiety. This, I think, is what makes it so scary, it&#39;s not a mythical monster, it&#39;s a real one, the one that sits in your gut as you read. </p>\n\n<p>At the moment, I&#39;m reading &quot;Heaven&#39;s River&quot; by Dennis E. Taylor, and it occurred to me that a VR environment of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves\">house</a> would be an amazing experience, good or bad.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear thoughts of others!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
