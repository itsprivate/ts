Kids will actually just seek out anything taboo, this is just free advertising!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t they understand the Streisand effect? This is guaranteed to just blow up as news and backfire on them!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Even at their best, comments like these are coping mechanism based on a just world fallacy, desperately wanting to believe that all will be well in the end, that human nature tends towards freedom, that censorship just simply <em>doesn&#39;t work</em> at accomplishing it&#39;s goals.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is... it obviously does work. </p>\n\n<p>We can all look at dictatorships that successfully prop up the regime&#39;s support rates, by denying negative information to their population. We can all look at school systems that provide more info on, for example, safe sex, will have will have measurably different outcomes in teenage sexual health.  </p>\n\n<p>More generally, the entire conceit of having a school system, is that <strong><em>obviously</em></strong> it can influence what kind of next generation we are raising. </p>\n\n<p>Even stepping away from the legal issue of censorship and free speech, to the realm of platforming, this applies. Big publishers <em>can</em> blacklist an author, stifle a genre, or promote a certain aesthetic style or even a political value. It happens all the time. Everyone who ever complained about &quot;cancel culture&quot;, deeply understands this. And of course so does anyone who advocated for boycotting or deplatforming something. (watch out, the two are sometimes the same people). </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Streisand Effect&quot; is not a scientifically proven pattern, it is an internet meme. Once under a blue moon, some really random incident goes viral, because someone screws up the optics of what book to burn, what book to legally ban, what book to blacklist, or even just what book to criticize, and gets an unintended effect. This doesn&#39;t mean that you can relax secure in the knowledge that this will always reliably happen. </p>\n\n<p>Relying on kamic justice to sort out what books people do and don&#39;t get to access, leads to apathy at best, and at worst you are being led on by somebody whose interest it is for you not to worry too much about <em>a certain type of book</em> getting banned, but still get worked up about their own favorite type of book facing the mildest possible forms of pushback.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
