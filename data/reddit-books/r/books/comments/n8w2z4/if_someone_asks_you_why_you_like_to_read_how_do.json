My Husband has literally, not read a single book since he was 14, and even then he can’t recall what it was.  He said he’s just never been into it and never found any desire to read anything. I told him he probably never had a desire because he never found any book, genre, author, or series that captured his interest/attention. Over the years I never let it bother me, but now I wish he would at least try a few books, or even audiobooks to see if he finds anything. He asked me tonight why I love to read. I tried to explain all the different reasons, but more so I have tried to explain that I want him to have the experience of finding one you can’t put down. The books where you literally can’t set it down until you’ve read until the end, the attachment to characters, the images and scenes you create for yourself, and just the overall emotions during and after a great book.\n\nSo for you book lovers, no matter the genre, how would you answer the question from someone who has literally never read a single book for pleasure, let alone as an adult.",
