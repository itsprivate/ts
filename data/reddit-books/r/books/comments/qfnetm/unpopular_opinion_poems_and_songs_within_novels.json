Maybe it&#39;s switching modes in my brain and it takes me out of &quot;story&quot; mode and into &quot;lore of yore&quot; mode (poetry edition!) -- something entirely achievable and less distracting in prose. Maybe it&#39;s just that it feels entirely too pretentious. Either way, I find it a bit jarring and when I see those italicized lines and I get a visceral reaction to them.  Maybe a bit dramatic, but I can&#39;t stand them even in the most venerable works.</p>\n\n<p>The one exception I can think of is the verse about the rings in LotR.
