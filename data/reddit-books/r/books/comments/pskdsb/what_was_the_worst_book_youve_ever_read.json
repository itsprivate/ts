The mysterious haunted house turned two straight guys gay. The horror!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also filled with sexist, racist, and antisemetic remarks. At one point in the narration she mocks a character&#39;s last name for being Jewish, and two different characters call him a Nazi. Oh, and he&#39;s also an abusive husband who&#39;s stingy with money and beats his wife, who they make a point to say is NOT Jewish, as if that makes her better somehow.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the scariest part of that book was the author herself. 0 out of 10, would not recommend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
