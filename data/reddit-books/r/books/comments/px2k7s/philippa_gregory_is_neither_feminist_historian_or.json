Honestly, all I got from her books was that women hate each other, women are motivated almost solely by passionate romance, and women are either bitchy shrews or epitomes of virginal goodness (the latter being a construct right out of medieval times.) She even went on a BBC documentary (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p015vhp1\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p015vhp1</a>) to repeat her <em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em> assertion that Anne Boleyn tried to have sex with her brother, because she was &quot;ambitious and ruthless enough for me to believe it&quot; (one of many gendered double-standards that this Feminist™ seems to embrace without any sense of irony). A little bit of dramatization or creative filling-in of gaps in the historical record are permissible, but not when the author takes it up to an 11 and perpetuates sexist and historically reductionist narratives, all while repeatedly claiming the mantle of scholarly legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a pity that all her novels are being popularized in adaptations (White Princess, Spanish Princess, etc.) that are somehow even worse. At least the novel didn&#39;t depict a fully-pregnant Catherine of Aragon doing something as stupid and reckless as charging straight into hand-to-hand combat with the Scots.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
