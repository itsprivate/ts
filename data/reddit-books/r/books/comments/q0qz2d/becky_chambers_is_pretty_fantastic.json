They tend toward short, highly enjoyable, character driven books. They&#39;re highly accessible with a fair amount of depth</p>\n\n<p>Most recently was A Psalm for the Wild Built which largely revolved around environmental themes. It was funny because I was in Yellowstone when I read part of it, and the book included a story which basically reflected the story of how when humans eliminated the wolves from Yellowstone the elk went into over drive and destroyed the environment. The environment ends up being a lot more healthy and diverse when the predators were there to keep things in balance. </p>\n\n<p>This book also had some conclusion about the meaning of life and tied it to the similarities between humans, animals, and the rest of environment. </p>\n\n<p>The Galaxy and the Ground Within was a bit before that\nThis one is part of the Wayfarer universe. A group of diverse species gets trapped in a dome on a transit station due to a crash in the satellite system. This had some strong quarantine parallels. The single best part of this book was the aliens discussing humans drinking milk. Simply hilarious. It&#39;s a great example of how Becky uses aliens to explore human habits and personalities by shifting everything just a bit. </p>\n\n<p>Before that was To Be Taught If Fortunate. I thought this book was going to be part of the Wayfarer series, but it wasn&#39;t, but I was like more than halfway through the book before I realized it wasn&#39;t going to link up with that universe. This one also had strong environmental themes. This might be my least favorite of Becky&#39;s books that I&#39;ve read. </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to more of her books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
