I liked it, it&#39;s well written, easy to read too, and I was quite captivated by the story.</p>\n\n<p>This is narrated by Kathy H., a woman who is going over her life and memories in an attempt to &quot;come to to terms with them&quot;. It&#39;s really hard for me to say exactly what I feel about this, not because it makes me undescribably happy or sad, just because it&#39;s causing a very specific feeling within me (or a bunch of different feelings) that I don&#39;t know how to describe. </p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed it. I think that, in many ways, it&#39;s quite scary and harrowing simply because of the world it takes place in. There&#39;s a certain element about this world that distinguishes it from our own, but I didn&#39;t feel like it was presented as an eventually big plot twist that would make you gasp. It&#39;s more like a slow realization and then a shock that you come to terms with and then leaves you thinking for a while about how inhumane it is. Raising kids for organ harvest, essentially.</p>\n\n<p>But it doesn&#39;t focus on that. Kathy instead focuses on her life, her memories, relationships, etc., and I think the reason why she does this makes a lot more sense once you&#39;ve reached the end. She&#39;s a clone destined for death, she&#39;s already accepted that and this story isn&#39;t about her and her friends trying to escape this. It&#39;s normal to them, this is just the wa.y things are and that&#39;s that.</p>\n\n<p>From what I understand now, she goes over her life and her various memories (and a lot of these moments are inevitably tied in to her fate) to maybe make it more real, to hang on it as much as she can, just to reminisce about her life. Even this I find super hard to explain, I don&#39;t know why. I think it&#39;s maybe really about that, just reminiscing and remembering her life, relationships, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I like that it doesn&#39;t focus on the cloning aspect of the world it&#39;s set in, it makes for something different. I&#39;ve seen a lot of reviews saying that this is THE big plot twist but that&#39;s it&#39;s a really disappointing one. I think it was never meant to be a massive twist. It&#39;s just introduced to you, Kathy talks about it as if it&#39;s a normal thing (which it is to her) and that&#39;s it. She doesn&#39;t talk about how shocking it is. It&#39;s just her life and that&#39;s that.</p>\n\n<p>I did enjoy this book, I liked the writing and I thought jt was very captivating. It was like sitting down with a friend and having a one-sided conversation or listening to their story. Something that I think I take away from it is that life is precious. People like Kathy are destined for death, and while we are as well, in a way, we have much more freedom with our own lives. It&#39;s important to make the most of them before we do die. I think that&#39;s what I can take away from this. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d really love to know what other people&#39;s thoughts on this are as I really am unable to formulate my own into words, for some reason. Let me know what you thought of this book!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
