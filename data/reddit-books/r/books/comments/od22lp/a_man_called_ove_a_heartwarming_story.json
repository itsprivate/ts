I heard that many people praised this book and thought I&#39;d give it a try too. Ove is a lonely, grumpy perfectionist who is still hurt by his wife&#39;s death and was always on the verge of suicide until an idiot with a Japanese car broke his mailbox. The book goes back and forth in time, Ove&#39;s past and present. The chapters of the past explain how he came to own only one car brand Saab, the injustice of society and his love. He starts out as cold and ends up becoming well respected and loved in the neighbourhood. The book ends in a very beautiful and sad way. This book beats Les Miserables as my new favourite book!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
