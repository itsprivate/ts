I had heard polarizing things about it (it seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of novel), but reading it in the aftermath of the <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">COVID-19 pandemic</span> and the various environmental crises in the news today made it hit really hard. Possibly moreso than if I had read it when it was written back in the 2000s, before the world felt quite so wildly off kilter. </p>\n\n<p>A few things that really stood out to me: the first was Crake and Jimmy&#39;s teenage years of trolling around the Internet. While I definitely wasn&#39;t exposed to anything as terrible as HottTotts or BrainFrizz, as a dude who spent way too much time unsupervised on the Early Internet (before Facebook&#39;s Walled Garden subsumed everything), I really identified with the casual sociopathy caused by seeing shocking content mediated by a screen. You see enough terrible stuff online and just kind of become inured to it which leaves you kind of feeling corroded and hollow inside after a while. </p>\n\n<p>The flashback sequence where <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Crake&#39;s plague takes over the world gave me vivid flashbacks to the early days of COVID. The lockdowns, the scramble for vaccines, the arrogance of pundits right up until the threat became real. It gave me a vivid feeling of &quot;there but for the grade of God go we.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, the looming backdrop of increasing environmental collapse that the wealthy people in the Compounds can avoid really resonated with my own climate-related anxieties. I&#39;ve been watching Canada and the PNW of the US get cooked by temperatures sometimes 40 degrees F higher than the usual average for this time of year, and the resulting wildfires and wondering &quot;is this it? Have we gone from climate change, to climate crisis, to climate catastrophe?&quot; Combine that with anxiety about California running out of water for good, and I&#39;m wondering if soon we&#39;ll all be eating SoyOBoy french fries and eating ChickieNobbs grown in tubes. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my rant about Oryx and Crake. On to Year of the Flood and MaddAddam, if the existential anxiety doesn&#39;t get me first. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else recently revisited these books? I&#39;m curious how people who first read them back in the 2010s might feel about revisiting them now that the predicted dystopia feels so much realer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
