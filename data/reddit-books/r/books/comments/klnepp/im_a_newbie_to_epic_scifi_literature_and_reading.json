Reading DUNE did not turn out the way I thought it would.\n \nI liked science fiction ideas in general ever since I was a kid. It was mostly due to the influence of films and thriller novels with light sci-fi plot lines with the exception of Andy Weir's *The Martian* which I loved. But I wanted to pick up some classic sci-fi works for quite some time.\n\nSo, this year, I decided to give DUNE a go as I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie that was supposed to come out this December. I started the novel in August. \n\nIt was going fine until the first couple of hundred pages, but soon the reading experience turned into a tough one. The world building was too complex, and the descriptions seemed to be too much.. of things, traditions, cultures, and whatnot. Additionally, I was having trouble creating the mental images of a lot of things.. example: all the equipment and machinery used on Arrakis.\n\nI don't know if this is how all epic sci-fi is written or if this is specific to particular works but the plot felt to be moving either far too slowly or moving in far too uninteresting way. I think the latter. It was never really exciting to me the journey of Paul and Jessica across the desert and how they get adopted into the Fremen clan.. and the Fremen rituals of Holy Mother and etc...\n\nUnfortunately, none of the things in the book made it a page-turner to me. I gave long break between readings. It took me months to finish this book. But I have to mention that I was reading the new paperback edition. I regretted not going for a kindle edition. That could also be a reason why I read it far too slowly.\n\nI also couldn't connect emotionally to any characters in the book which is strange as there are SO MANY characters. The villain seemed too typical and there are specific plot points that made no sense to me.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more. I came to DUNE with different expectations and minimal reading experience in hardcore science fiction literature which I believe to also be contributing to how I'm feeling about this novel. I was left fully exhausted by the end and didn't pickup another novel for this month.\n\n**EDIT**: *Amazed at the response and support I got here and very happy that I was proven wrong by you all who upheld a fellow reader's genuine opinion. Thank you all very much.*",
