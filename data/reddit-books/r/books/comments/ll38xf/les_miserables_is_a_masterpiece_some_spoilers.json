I love how you find the same characters in different situations and places and you find out how they are connected in some way or another! Victor Hugo is a genius!!! I really love the character Jean Valjean and his transformation from a criminal to a man who only wishes good for others. He is selfless and kind and even sacrifcing himself for the good of others like turning himself in, saving a man who was wrongfully accused of being Jean Valjean. The Thenadiers are dispicable and really good villains in the book. They made a desperate mother work herself to death for the sake of her daughter who was a slave to the Thenadiers. I really love this book!",
