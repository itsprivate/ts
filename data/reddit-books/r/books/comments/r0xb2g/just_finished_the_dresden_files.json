How the author laid out Dresden&#39;s thoughts, feelings, and decision process really connected with me. Dresden felt like a real human being. The conclusions the author comes up with about life, the right for others to make choices, and consequences of his actions. It&#39;s all very human and really relatable. How the Carpenter family is portrayed, along with the Knights of the Cross is phenomenal. I like how he illustrates how the Swords are to be utilized. His take on morality and good and evil... Just phenomenal stuff. I can&#39;t wait for more.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also Mab is a <em>fascinating</em> character.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
