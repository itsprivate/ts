I just inherited a <strong>TON</strong> of books from my late grandmother, and some of them are very rare and expensive. However, they come with a caveat- she was an insane pack rat. These books were full of 40 years of dust. I am getting the <strong>WORST</strong> allergy attacks. I normally do not have allergies. We are talking, just being in the same room as them closes my throat up and gives me sneezing attacks. It is brutal. I’ve been having nonstop migraines and although my sinuses appear pretty clear, I’ve got a really fucked up throat and I’m waking up choking on clear mucus. (<strong>COVID negative</strong> btw. First thing I checked.)</p>\n\n<p>God, why would you do this to me??</p>\n\n<p>I have tried using antihistamines, fumigating with baking soda, carefully leaving the books outside (not in direct sunlight. They’re much too old!) and feeling silly, and nothing has worked. I’m out of ideas. <strong>You cannot find these books on an E-reader. They are ANCIENT and very obscure. The younger ones are from the 30s-40s. I’m trying to be as delicate as possible.</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>What the heck can I do? I really want to read these! My grandmother was a fascinating human and her library was incredible.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
