But the first one I just finished was, &quot;The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck&quot; by Mark Manson.. I was looking for a self help book and the cover made this one stand out to me. It took me about a year (sad, I know.. periods of on and off reading/starting other books, and just having a baby and new home will deplete your time like no other) to finish, but I was able to remember all the stuff and I&#39;m just happy I finished a book since I can remember! </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m getting into a few more now (The Institute, The Silent Patient, Wherever You Go, There You Are etc.. whatever I&#39;m in the mood for) </p>\n\n<p>Just want to say thanks to you all for inspiring me to get back to reading. It was something I loved do as a kid( mostly Goosebumps lol ) And it&#39;s nice to be able to indulge in something that brings no negativity and I can just escape to. I am starting to find joy in reading again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
