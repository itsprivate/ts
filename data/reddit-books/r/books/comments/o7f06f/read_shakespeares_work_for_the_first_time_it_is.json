It was As you like it, It was a quick 2-3 hour read but then I started to analyze all these dialogues and plot. I thought it was very funny and amazingly sarcastic on the tone. Rosalind is a great character, and so is Touchstone. If I am not mistaken As you like it is a metaphor about how life simply has no greater meaning, it&#39;s ephemeral at best. </p>\n\n<p>Next I read A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream,  another comedy this at times did remind me of As you like it, I could see a similar notion about an entire different progression of story. I think out of two that I&#39;ve read I see love is a theme he uses constantly,  and also comments on what makes people fall in love generally beauty and appearance. There was more of a romantic input on this story then the other one which was more playful. I really liked the play within the play. \n- Also, I think I can see Puck being close friends with Touchstone, not going to lie. </p>\n\n<p>I think I will spend rest of my life reading and studying more and more about his work. I have found more of his book at a local bookstore.  And I have found Othello and Macbeth which I am going to read next.  I think Shakespeare is the foundation of many stories I have seen in my life before in various Tv shows and movies. It takes time but it totally worth it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
