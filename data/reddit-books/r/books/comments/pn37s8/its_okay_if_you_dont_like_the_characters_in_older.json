People read it and say something like “the book has interesting themes and good prose, but I just don’t care about the characters and they’re not likable.”</p>\n\n<p>I find it kind of amusing because I doubt it ever even crossed FSF’s mind to make them “likeable.” Considering the themes and what the characters represent, it would actually be pretty strange if they <em>were</em> likeable. </p>\n\n<p>The characters are often used to portray the themes in these types of stories. You’re not meant to like and get to know them like you would in a modern novel, that’s not the point; they’re crafted by the author to show the themes and ideas central to the story. I think that’s a large part of the reason why books like these are even considered classics at all- the themes. Each character in The Great Gatsby exists for a specific purpose; maybe that makes them feel stiff and unlikeable to some readers who are used to modern writing and character creation, but it can also be a really rewarding type of story too. No, I’m not saying you’re wrong if you don’t like the book - to each their own - but at least give it a chance from the perspective of what it’s trying to do. </p>\n\n<p>I just recently watched a video where someone gave The Great Gatsby a low rating because they “just couldn’t relate to all these rich people.” I don’t think being able to personally relate to characters should have any place in reviewing how good the story is. There are stories about all kinds of horrific events and people that the average reader couldn’t possibly relate to, that doesn’t mean they’re not great stories because they’re not relatable. Fiction can help us have understanding and empathy for people and situations outside of our personal bubble of experiences. That seems like one of the main <em>points</em> of fiction. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, one of the main things that make classics <em>classic</em> is the themes, and characters are often used to portray them in the narrative in a way that isn’t focused on making them likable or relatable for the reader.</p>\n\n<p>If this type of story just doesn’t connect with you at all, that’s totally fine too! I just think it can be rewarding to read these classic books with a bit of a different mindset and expectations.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
