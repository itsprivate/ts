I really enjoyed the book and the female lead, but saw so many reviewers calling her a Mary Sue. I thought she was strong and made good choices, while still struggling with the events that transpired around her and what to do about them. Does being competent and strong automatically make you a Mary Sue?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
