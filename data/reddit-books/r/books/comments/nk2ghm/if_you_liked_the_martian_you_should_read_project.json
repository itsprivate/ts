While it probably didn't have a lot of pure literary merit, it was unabashedly geeky, thrilling, fun and entirely deserving of all the accolades and the impact it made on the current sci-fi landscape.\n\nHis next novel, Artemis, magnified all the faults of the first while retaining none of the charm. Attempts to write a more complex plot left it a heavy, jumbled mess. The lack of real characters or character development in The Martian was excusable. In Artemis all attempts at it were forced and cringey. The science and long technical explanations went from seamlessly driving the narrative in The Martian to hampering it to the extent where you get actively frustrated by them. In short – nothing worked.\n\nProject Hail Mary is, in a sense, a return to the author's roots. Like in The Martian, the protagonist is a genius and witty scientist caught alone in a bad situation who must use his knowledge to fix things. The stakes are a lot higher. Instead of Mars, this time he is on a spaceship far away from Earth. Instead of saving just himself this time all of humanity is on the line. Oh and he has amnesia, so isn't able to remember the ship, his mission or even his own name.\n\nWhat follows is a saga of exploration, trial and error, mess ups, fixes, near deaths etc. as he inches closer to his goal. It's The Martian on steroids, and the author makes no excuses for it.\n\nSome of the author's faults still stood this time around. I'm putting some of them in spoiler tags to be safe, but they aren't really spoilers so read them if you'd like.\n\n* At 500 pages, it is a bit of a slog. There are a lot of repetitive parts and could have been easily edited down another 100 pages at least.\n* I found it harder to excuse the juvenile writing this time around considering the author is on his *third* bestselling novel. There is so much wrong with pacing, narrative structure, characters, exposition etc. that \"yeah, science!\" won't magically fix.\n* The science stuff – >!While the scientific explanations and overall plot in The Martian made some amount of sense, Project Hail Mary makes you take one too many massive leaps of logic. That isn't a deal breaker for a sci-fi book by any means, but the author's writing style emphasizes the \"science\" side while giving you a story which would fit better in The Expanse.!<\n* The protagonist – >!For both better and worse, the protagonist is Mark Watney 2.0. He is a genius at every possible science, has all the knowledge of the world at the tip of his tongue, is witty, commanding when he needs to be, selfless, empathetic...Oh and he has six pack abs of course. While Mark Watney came off as charming, this one is just..dull.!<\n\nWith sci-fi tastes as varied as they are, it's hard to predict how the average reader will feel about Project Hail Mary. There are a lot of fun moments, some thrills and a lot of faults. So I will simply say that if you liked The Martian, you will probably like this one as well.",
