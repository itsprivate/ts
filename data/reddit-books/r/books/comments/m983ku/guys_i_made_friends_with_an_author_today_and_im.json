This guy came to my work and when I was on break, he left me a signed copy of a book he wrote that’s one of my favorite genres (post-apocalyptic fiction), and sent an email with a FULL COPY OF HIS UNPUBLISHED BOOK ! \n\nI had a patient about 6 months ago who told me he was a writer, and we got to talking about our favorite authors/genres etc. Turns out, we’re both big fans of Stephen King, Clive Barker, H.P. Lovecraft and essentially any crime, mystery, sci-fi or horror stories. He ended up recommending a Weird Tales-esque book of short stories written by local writers from our state. Well, I checked it out and he turned out to be one of the authors! He hadn’t even told me at the time, so I read it, loved it and gave it a 5 star review.\n\nSo he came in for his routine appointment today and I mentioned the book of short stories, telling him how great it was/I was excited he has work in that particular genre. He ended up telling me about a book he wrote 20 years ago; a post-apocalyptic story relatable to The Stand by Stephen King and Swan Song by Robert McCammon. He also told me about a book he’s currently working on that is similar to R.L. Stine/horror for kids, so we exchanged emails and he told me he’d send me a little more info. Ended up sending me the whole thing lol\n\nI’d love to hear anyone else’s exciting author friend stories!\n\nEdit: unfortunately I can’t give the name of the author because I’d probably be breaking a HIPAA law",
