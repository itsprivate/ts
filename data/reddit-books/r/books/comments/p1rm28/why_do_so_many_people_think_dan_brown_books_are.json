Not every book will have beautiful prose and amazing character development. (If I remember correctly, the protagonist of most of all Dan Browns books reoccurs, so his growth wouldn&#39;t be seen in just one book, nor is it the focus of that one book)</p>\n\n<p>And as a quick disclaimer, I read the books a long time ago, and don&#39;t remember them word for word. I&#39;m not defending him as a good author, I&#39;m just trying to figure out what makes an author good. Especially when the point of the book isn&#39;t going to always check off a bunch of boxes (Prose, development, strong lead...)</p>\n\n<p>Thank you anyone who can provide some insight!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
