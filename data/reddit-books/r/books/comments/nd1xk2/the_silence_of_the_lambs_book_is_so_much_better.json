I don't know how it got there, since I had never read it, nor had I watched the movie, but I thought, \"hey, why not?\"\n\nBest decision ever. I can honestly say this book is in my top 10 of all time. It was amazing. I can't put into words how excellent it was, it was just *that* good. The storyline had me hooked from the very first pages, every single character was fleshed out, and I particularly have to highlight Dr. Lecter's characterization. He was written so compellingly that I found myself getting creeped out whenever he made an appearance in the novel (and I'm the type who *loves* creepy stories and never gets scared). This was the first time I've felt genuinely disturbed by a fictional character. Even if you're not a horror/scary fan like I am, this book is worth reading just for the masterful descriptions and plot.\n\nI heard that the movie was just as good if not better than the book, so yesterday I decided to watch it. I'll admit, it was a great movie and Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job bringing Hannibal to life. It deserved all the Oscars it received. However, in my opinion the book was miles better. So much character development, both from Clarice as well as \"side characters\" like Jack, was not in the movie. Many scenes I loved in the book got cut, which is understandable of course, but at least for me, it means the book is better.\n\nIf you're a fan of the movie, read the book. Yes, it's long, but trust me, you won't get bored. You learn so much more about the characters and their motivations, not to mention the exquisite writing.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way?",
