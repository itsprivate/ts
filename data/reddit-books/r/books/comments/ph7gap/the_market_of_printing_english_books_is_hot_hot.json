In my city, Mashhad, there&#39;s a dingy book shop called &quot;Ofogh Book&quot; that sells all sorts English, French, German, Italian etc etc books. These books are printed unofficially. And there&#39;s no other choice because due to sanctions, big Western publishers can&#39;t sell their books here. But printing houses won&#39;t accept that. They find the lithographs online and they print them and sell them at 1/10 of the price that they would usually sell for. Keep in mind that some book shops, like Pardis Book in Mashhad, sell original Western-printed books but these are for collectors mostly.</p>\n\n<p>However, most of the nation&#39;s book readers are moving to e-readers. There&#39;s this e-book reader called Fidibook that&#39;s selling like candies. Me and my cousin both bought one. It&#39;s kinda weak and is far from being on par with Nook or Kindle but it&#39;s also 1/10 of the price.</p>\n\n<p>So I hope you enjoyed this look into Iran&#39;s English book reading culture. I read this article on ISNA that &quot;the low printing volume of books --- 5000 or less --- is a failure for our culture&quot; and yes I agree. People are just not interested in Persian books anymore. Self-censorship runs rampant and Persian authors are far from being interesting... All modern Persian books are basically Angela&#39;s Ashes. Plus. Nobody wants to read about a culture they know about. They want to escape their mundane lives. And English books just provides them with  that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
