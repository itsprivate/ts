Bonus for including a &quot;wasn&#39;t it something last night&quot; card about a hotel in Malaga.</p>\n\n<p>Car manuals: these act as reviews of the car rather than the book.  If you can&#39;t fix it without you and the book getting plastered with black gunge you know what you&#39;re in for if you buy one.</p>\n\n<p>Erotica: this didn&#39;t happen very often but we got one collection of women&#39;s erotica with an extremely durable spine that had been left as floppy as a tissue from the owner holding it open at every single page.  And it was a thick book.  She must have got a LOT of use out of it.</p>\n\n<p>Rather alarming: a pocket surgery handbook, very neat design with each operation fitted into a two-page spread.  I think it was the gall bladder removal pages that got stuck together.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
