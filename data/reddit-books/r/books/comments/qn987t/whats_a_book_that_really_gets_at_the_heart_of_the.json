It was indeed quite comprehensive of the human condition, but not quite comprehensive enough; I feel like it skipped or censored through ellipses some more racier or dirtier parts of the human condition, and while it was quite psychologically and phenomenologically deep, revealing as it does even the most shameful parts of our psyche, I still feel like it maintained too much of a God&#39;s eye (or Tolstoy&#39;s eye!) point of view rather than the really human all too human one.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s a book that REALLY GETS at the heart of the human condition and what life and the world is really like, phenomenologically and universally? I want a book that explores almost every phenomenological state of mind and also almost every life event that almost every human being will tend to have in their lifetime. I&#39;m way too academic, theoretical, and philosophical and in the ivory tower. What is a book that, though of course no replacement to life, encompasses what life is? What would introduce an alien (like me, say) into Being Human 101?</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a big ask, so perhaps you may wish to answer more modest versions of the question: perhaps a book not entirely comprehensive of the human condition, but just somewhat so. Or perhaps a couple of books rather than one book which are indeed comprehensive.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
