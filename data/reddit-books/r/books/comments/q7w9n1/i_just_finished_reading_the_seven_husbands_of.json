I know a lot of people talk about really falling in love with characters in books and to some extent while I always liked certain characters, I never had that &quot;love&quot; for them that I see other people describe. </p>\n\n<p>But reading about Evelyn Hugo.....wow....I haven&#39;t met a character as real as her in a book, just like the main character in the story, I was completely enraptured by Evelyn even with all her flaws and eccentricities. I know she wasn&#39;t a saint but that did not stop me from wanting to know more about her. Major props to Taylor Jenkins Reid for creating such a complex character you cannot help but root for. The whole time I was reading I was completely sucked into her world and I enjoyed every second of it.  I really cannot put my thoughts into words after finishing the novel but I am happy that I got to read about her story through this book. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot wait to read more books and discover amazingly written characters such as Evelyn!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
