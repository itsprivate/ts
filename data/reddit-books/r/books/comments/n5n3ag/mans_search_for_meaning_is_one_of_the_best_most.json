Frank who’s an educated psychiatrist, also tells the reader about the horrific things he saw, and how he observed people and how they were trying to cope with seemingly impossible obstacles. Frankl’ theorized that people whom find meaning in their suffering, can best cope with the horrifying situation they’re in. Frankl himself found strength in one day meeting his wife again, which made him continue on his journey, through the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp. \n\nThe first part gives insight into how people in the most dire situations tried to find a way to ‘move forward’ even when it seemed as all was lost.\n\nThe second part of the book is dedicated to logotherapy - one which he himself developed. Logotherapy is based on the concept that the biggest motivator in life is finding a sense of purpose and meaning. Thus, we have freedom in finding meaning in what we as humans do and experience, and that life has meaning under all circumstances.\n\nMan’s search for meaning might be my favorite book. It’s short - about 150 pages, it’s absolutely horrific, melancholic and sends chills down your spine. It’s an amazing book, I’ve read it 2 times now, the philosophical rhetoric that finding a sense of purpose, is a key to moving forward has really stuck with me.\n\nGreat read, would recommend to anyone.",
