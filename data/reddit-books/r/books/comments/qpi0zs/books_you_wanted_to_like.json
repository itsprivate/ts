I bought it because it looked interesting and because she said it was good, and I didn&#39;t bother finishing it even though I was a hand full of pages left from finishing it.  That book had some bold choices that just made things awkward for me.  I also bought a bunch of Chuck Palahniuk books because I loved Haunted, but those also let me down and also had some bold choices.  So I was wondering if any one else was excited about getting their hands on certain books only to feel let down by them?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
