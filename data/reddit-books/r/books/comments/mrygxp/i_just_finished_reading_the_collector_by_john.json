We never really get to meet G.P and Fowles thought he had to use some filler so he used. The story would have been the ultimate guide book to all psycho-thrillers, had Fowles focused more on F and M's conflict in newer interesting, fresh ways. But again considering the era in which it was written, we can give some leeway to that.\n\nAll in all, it's what we need in our current thriller novels. Psychological unraveling.
