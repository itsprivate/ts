  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I couldn&#39;t put this book down, but I ended up being disappointed. Not necessarily because of the ending, but because of a lack of character development. \nThe protagonist stays painstakingly shy and self conscious for a very long time, to the point of becoming annoying. When she does gain confidence, it&#39;s to be harsh with the servants. \nShe remains incredibly devoted to Maxim without him giving her much reason to. No deep friendship or swoon-worthy moments between them.\nYes, I understand that Rebecca was a cruel liar and adulteress, but does that really give someone the right to murder her? I wasn&#39;t convinced. Sure, it&#39;s a crime of passion, but I wasn&#39;t moved to feel much sympathy for Maxim. He even said he feels no remorse and would do it again.\nI expected more to happen. More development in the characters and their relationships. It just fell flat for me after all that reading. I also wanted ghostly or spooky moments and they never came.\nFeel free to disagree! It&#39;d be so boring if we all had the same taste :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
