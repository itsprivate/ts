For the most part I was not bored but I was growing tired of it in the third book. \nRegardless, I really liked the series. I thought the ending was very satisfying. I really liked the direction the trilogy took regarding religion, Gods and afterlife. Although it was cliched at times it was a very good read. What are your thoughts? \nBy the way, this is the first book series that I have finished so I feel very proud.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I forgot to add that I really love the plot twists in this series because it&#39;s usually foreshadowed very slightly but very impactful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
