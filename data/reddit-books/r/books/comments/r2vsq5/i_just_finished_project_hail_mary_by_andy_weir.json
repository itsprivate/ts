I found a <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/the-read-down/the-best-books-of-2021/\">reddit link</a> leading to &quot;Penguin Random House&quot; &#39;s list of 2021&#39;s best books. I had just finished a few books and was looking for something good to pass my time. didn&#39;t think I would come in contact with possibly one of my favorite books this year (I finished it in two days).<br/>\nOf course, from the first chapter I recognized the same style as &quot;The Martian&quot; and kept wondering if it&#39;s the same author:<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">it is</span>.<br/>\nI don&#39;t wanna spoil anything. Practically talking about any aspect of it spoils the experience, but to give you the general idea: &quot;A man is in space&quot;. That&#39;s all you need and it&#39;s all in the cover.  </p>\n\n<p>The writing is incredible, also very easy to understand. the physics and math is well explained for people who forgot that kind of stuff, and practically a walk in the park for people who retained their highschool-level science education.<br/>\nCharacter building is sublime and you&#39;ll feel tethered to the main Character.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes; My voice sparked amidst a paragraph and scared me because I was so invested in the story. My mind used most of it&#39;s power to build the world around it.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t talk much about it. But if you&#39;re looking for a good experience. I dearly recommend this book as it ignited my passion for science and more importantly, for &quot;hard science-fiction&quot;. One thing I learned, The best science fiction books are the ones set in your own time-line. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t wait what else will come from my newest favorite author.  </p>\n\n<p>To the Author: Thank you, you&#39;ve made me a very happy person</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
