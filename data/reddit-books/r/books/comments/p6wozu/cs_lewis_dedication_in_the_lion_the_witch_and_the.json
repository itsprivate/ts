As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it.

Lewis&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The stages of liking, outgrowing, and returning to fairy tales is a comment that resonated with how I&#39;ve been reading of late. I have been revisiting the books that I read back in school, those that I grew up with. I realise that perhaps I could not have enjoyed these even a few years earlier, and yet, having reached a certain age (how wonderfully Lewis leaves that open-ended), I&#39;m realising that despite what is often said, these are, in fact, stories that I can return to, no matter how much my age may supposedly separate me from the maturity that these books express. Of course, part of returning is a way of feeding nostalgia, but I have also been feeling that these books still have things to give. They have not been exhausted.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
