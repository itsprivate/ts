A super prolific children's author ([Dr. De Soto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif), Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the [New Yorker](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg) (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).\n\nIn short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.\n\nCurious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:\n\n1. **Shrek has super powers.** He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.\n2. **The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.** I’ve never been a fan of “ugly art” a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is [something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg) are depicted. The art fits the theme.\n3. **The Verbs are great.** Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that’s in the first few pages.\n4. **It isn’t Disney-fied.** Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.\n\nAnd I think that’s the best part. Steig doesn’t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.\n\nIn the book’s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:\n\n>***“He faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.”***\n\nThen he marries the princess.\n\nSo Shrek has literary origins!
