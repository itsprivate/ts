  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was doing some reading about the history of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg\">Shrek</a> (long story), and learned that it was a children’s book written ten years before the movie came out.</p>\n\n<p>Not only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as 1. A super prolific children&#39;s author (<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif\">Dr. De Soto</a>, Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the <a href=\"https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg\">New Yorker</a> (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).</p>\n\n<p>In short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.</p>\n\n<p>Curious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shrek has super powers.</strong> He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.</li>\n<li><strong>The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.</strong> I’ve never been a fan of “ugly art” a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg\">something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence</a> are depicted. The art fits the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>The Verbs are great.</strong> Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that’s in the first few pages.</li>\n<li><strong>It isn’t Disney-fied.</strong> Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And I think that’s the best part. Steig doesn’t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.</p>\n\n<p>In the book’s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>“He faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.”</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then he marries the princess.</p>\n\n<p>So Shrek has literary origins! Who knew?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
