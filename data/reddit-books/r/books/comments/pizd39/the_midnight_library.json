Like Nora, I struggle with poor making decisions. I have opportunities in front of me but I always end up letting them go. I’m so caught up with my own shit that I forgot other people around me. I hurt everyone around me that’s why I’m also not happy. This book will help you realize that sometimes, it is us who makes things harder. It is us who makes things complicated because we are so focused on ourselves. We tend to forget about others who love us dearly simply because we don’t even love ourselves.  Also, self pity will just drown you so stop doing it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
