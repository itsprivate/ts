And I absolutely loved it. It is so well-written and even through there are just two characters and the story takes place in one location, something interesting is always happening. There were so many moments when I was literally on the edge of my seat and scared out of my mind. Some of those were when Annie squeezes the life out of the rat, the hobbling scene of course and when she kills the cop. These just sent my heart racing. </p>\n\n<p>Annie Wilkes is horrific and the way her actions, manners and thoughts are described, the way she keeps getting worse and worse gradually, it&#39;s just brilliant. I thought that it was a really interesting choice to tell the readers the story of Annie&#39;s past through Paul reading her Memory Lane book. It added to the horror and tension of the book and made it impossible to stop reading without getting to know the extent of Annie&#39;s horrific past. </p>\n\n<p>It was so good. No book has made me feel how this one did and I am looking forward to reading more of Stephen King.</p>\n\n<p>P. S. The reference to the Overlook hotel was so smooth man.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
