I don't know exactly how it works, but my state (and my tax dollars) pays for it and my local library gives me access to an absolute ton of ebooks for free. I'm sure many of you have similar systems available to you.\n\nAnyway, when I'm done with an ebook, especially one I had on hold, I don't like to let it expire on it's own. Now, for those of you who don't know, you can check out a book and keep it for the whole loan period, and when it's up the book is automatically returned for you - no interaction required. But the neat thing is, the system is able to estimate how long you'll have to wait to receive that book, based on the standard loan period. So, if three people are waiting in line for one book and the standard loan period is two weeks, it'll be six weeks before I'll get to check out the book.\n\nAnyway, when I have a book to return, I have this little ritual I do where I click into the book's page and I double check how many people are in line behind me waiting for that book. Then, when I go to my Loans page to return it, I get a little charge out of the fact that someone else, perhaps hundreds of miles away, is getting an email informing them that the book they've been waiting for is now available to check out. I imagine their surprise and excitement at being able to read this book a week (or more!) earlier than expected. It's a little, random act of kindness I can do once every few days that makes me feel a little better about myself, and a little more connected to my community in general and the fans of that book in specific.\n\nAll this to say, if you're in Wisconsin and you have Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series on hold, please return it early when you're done with it! I have to wait six months for each book!",
