I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to compute what I just read. I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery. \n🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. \nI also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls! \nI am not surprised in the slightest that this is the highest selling mystery book of all time!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all so much for the other recommendations. Once I’ve finished all the other books on my list - I’ve got 40 - I’ll get round to all these. They all sound amazing!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I’m so glad I convinced so many of you to pick the book up. I hope you all enjoy it and be sure to return to this post and leave your thoughts when you’re finished! However, I recommend starting on ‘The Murder of Roger Ackoryd’, if you haven’t read any Agatha Christie before - it’s a better introduction to her work. Then read ‘And Then There Were None’.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: some people thought i included a spoiler when it wasn’t so to shut them up i’ve removed it. and also, to the trolls - shush.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4 (god I’m doing a lot of these 😅): thanks to those of you recommended the BBC/Charles Dance adaptation. It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you’ve finished the book, you ought to watch it. Felt that it wasn’t as chilling as the book, but that might just be because I know the ending lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
