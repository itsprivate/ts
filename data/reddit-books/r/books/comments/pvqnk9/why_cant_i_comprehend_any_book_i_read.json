I am generally considered a smart person, however I have always had issues with reading comprehension. It is the same way for me when I am given an audiobook. I do not know what is going on most of the time. The only book that I somehow ever managed to make it through was House of Leaves bY Mark Z Danielewski, so I am capable of it, i am sure. I have no issues understanding and comprehending text in other situations, because I text my friends all the time and am able to understand them. I also write a lot and have written a short story of 40,000 words. However, even Harry Potter seems impossible and daunting to get through. I just do not understand what is happening, even with an audiobook. This issue seems to be affectIng me in other areas, especially schoolwork where I am learning subjects such as biology which are very text-heavy. If anyone has any ideas what Is going on in my brain, let me know. Or at least please give me leads to someone who might.</p>\n\n<p>It is just frustrating because I know people that can easily go through a book a day and it comes as naturally to them as simply writing. \nIt would help me immensely.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
