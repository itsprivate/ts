But I&#39;ve been wondering if the whole Dune series worth reading because I have heard many different opinions about this series. Some says Dune is great as a stand alone, some says the last 3 is not really worth it and there&#39;s also some says that I should read all 6 books.<br/>\nIf I can, I would get the first 3 books try it out and if I really love it I would buy the rest. But the delivery fee to my country is huge (52$ fee for 87$ books), because of that I usually have to buy at least 10 books at once. So I would really appreciate if you guys can give me some of your opinions.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing maybe you guys should know is that I chose Dune as my sci-fi starter because many of my favorite fantasy books is said to be familiar to Dune or have its influence.</p>\n\n<p>P/s: English is not my first language so please forgive me if I made some mistake.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
