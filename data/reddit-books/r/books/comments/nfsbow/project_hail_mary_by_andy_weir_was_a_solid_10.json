A very interesting plot - it took a direction I wouldn't have even imagined, and I couldn't put the book down till the end. The only thing that made me uneasy was the \"meburger\" lol. I loved the character development & story structure where it bounces from past to present. Very pleasant ending too, and I hope in the movie version they'll show us Stratt's reaction to receiving the beetle lol and whether he goes back or not. Super thorough characters too.",
