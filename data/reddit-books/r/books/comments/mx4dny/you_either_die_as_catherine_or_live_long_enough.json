  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve recently finished <em>Wuthering Heights</em> for the first time since I was 16. As a teen enchanted with the mid-2000s emo bands and overdramatic romantic platitudes their whiny lyrics offered, Heathcliff and Catherine’s tumultuous romance and frequent threats to cease existing without the other were pretty casual reading for me. </p>\n\n<p>Back then, I recall throwing the book down in anger when Catherine died. I rooted so hard for them, and thought Heathcliff such a dark, romantic figure in how his love for Catherine endured for years. My feeling was that Heathcliff was just so caught up in his missed opportunity for Catherine, and fell into a sort of maddened depression.</p>\n\n<p>But yesterday, as I finished a re-read, I could not get over how nasty and evil Heathcliff was throughout. Catherine too, but her death improved her character dramatically. I much preferred her ghost.</p>\n\n<p>As an adult, it&#39;s obvious how clearly toxic C&amp;H’s  relationship  was, how their self-centeredness was only thinly veiled as “passion”. They burned each other and everything else surrounding them, sparing thoughts only for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of them wasted time dignifying their respective spouses or relatives by treating them humanely, and it’s clear that they barely possessed the emotional tools to care for one another.  Bronte doesn’t seem to condone the pair’s behavior, hence the title&#39;s descriptor <em>Wuthering,</em> which was lost on me as a teen, but makes a lot of sense now. </p>\n\n<p>Heathcliff’s bad boy character has been copied so many times in bestselling “chick lit” (see <em>Twilight</em>, <em>50 Shades</em>, etc). And as a mom now who will sometimes dare to read things on <em>Reese’s Book Club</em> lists, such was my annoyance at recognizing this abusive Heathcliff archetype in “chick lit”, that I began to wonder what it was that attracted so many people to this kind of self-fueled passion (or selfish, insane behavior) found over and over in literature. There’s always a sad, tragic backstory for these <em>Heathcliffs</em>. Presumably, their love interest discovers the backstory and (shocker) loves the <em>Heathcliff</em> anyway, tolerating their rude, destructive behaviors long enough to change them. </p>\n\n<p>Have fictional women no free will?! Is it our literary responsibility to heal every damaged creature that comes simpering our way?! I was actually a little glad that Catherine was no angel in <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and Heathcliff was never vindicated, because it felt like neither of these spoiled characters deserved a sliver of sympathy. But there are so many stories (in books, movies, and TV)  that live in the fantasy that two people can treat one another like street trash and somehow end up together.  </p>\n\n<p>And then I realized my own transformation: from passionate, attached Catherine to the &quot;oh hell-naw&quot; nanny Ellen Dean, mature and disillusioned by the facade of “passionate love”- yet still somehow curious enough about it to be re-reading the book. And all the other books inspired by it, too. </p>\n\n<p>So I guess, somehow, Heathcliff prevails still. </p>\n\n<p>But my question to you, fellow Nellys, is why?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
