Like, my expectations were really high considering how much people seem to love Kaz and Inej and all the five star ratings. But yeah, I don't think *Six of Crows* really delivered. It is average at best. And I hate to say this, but... God damn was it boring for the first half. I thought a heist would be more exciting, but it was so dry. And people say that you don't need to read Shadow and Bone to understand the book, but I feel like I would've been even more confused if I hadn't. I feel like the worldbuilding could've been done a little better. Inej had sweet moments, but it makes me cringe when they call her the Wraith. I also aged up in the characters in my mind like a lot of people because it doesn't seem believable for them to be teenagers. Kaz and Inej seemed a little too perfect and too good at being criminals. Like, Inej became the most skilled spy in a year? Meh. There was a lot of telling and not showing. I think Kaz felt a little cliche sometimes too. I didn't find him charming. Jesper and Wylan deserved more development. I mean, I'm currently 1/3 through *Crooked Kingdom* because I heard it was way better than the first book. But I'm finding the same issues with pacing and stuff. Having said all that, I do enjoy the Kanej moments and I really wish there was more. And Kaz needs to care more for Jesper smh. Overall, I think there was potential to make it better but I'm sad I didn't love it as much as most people. I really am. Also, GORGEOUS cover.",
