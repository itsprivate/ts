It turns out this is book 3 of 3 written so far, because there are going to be 6 books. I'm wondering if that was the original plan. I doubt it because while I do enjoy the books, the second 2 definitely have a fair amount of filler with unremarkable scenes and repeated, predictable interactions between characters. This book could easily lose 150 pages. \nThis is not a new phenomenon. The other series that immediately come to mind are the Outlander series, in which each book gets less relevant as they go along, The Clan of the Cave Bear series, and quite possibly the Name of the Wind series (if it gets finished at all). I'm sure I'm forgetting others. It seems like once a book or author gets moderately popular the series start to get unnecessarily longer. I'm not saying that I don't like where the stories go, it's that they begin to take very circuitous routes to get there, where the middle 70% of the books are irrelevant to the story arcs as a whole.  I'll still read them, to a point, but I do lose some respect for that author. Do they think readers don't notice? I guess it doesn't matter, because I'm sure they do make more money this way, but it does make me less likely to begin a new series by the same author.",
