Seemingly unfiltered snark, hashed in with memes, and grand exaggerations of how bad the book was to the point that you think maybe it isn&#39;t actually so bad, but the reviewer just wanted to go viral on the platform and follow current trends. They all follow the same lines and basic setup, and it sounds more like a bunch of edgy 8th graders complaining about how much the book sucked rather than any cohesive analysis. Some of them don&#39;t even draw from examples in the text, they just complain without giving any context, and seem more focused on being witty than perpetuating any real discourse. Are all Goodreads book reviews like this? I think I&#39;ve seen a few complaints about the site itself around here, but I had no idea it was going to be something like this. I&#39;m very confused.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
