There could be much more to it.&quot;</em> I later realize that, while I love my grandmother, she was absolutely wrong in this case. You <em>should</em> judge a book by its cover, but not because that is what foretells how good or bad the content is.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m here to tell all authors, aspiring or not, that before you publish your book, you should make sure the cover is just as great as your story. It is human nature to judge what they see before reading. While it may seem shallow, I simply glance over books without an aesthetically pleasing cover. Not that I mean to do this, but because that is what grabs a reader&#39;s attention.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I&#39;m in the YA section of Barnes &amp; Noble and the covers look like it was produced by 12-year-old me on Wattpad, I will immediately be disinterested. But if I&#39;m in the fantasy section and see the cover of a beautiful Goddess, of course, that will pique my curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>The moral of the story: do not disrespect your hard work with a mediocre cover just because you believe that people won&#39;t judge a book by its cover. Most people, like myself, absolutely will.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
