It might be in part because most of my friends don’t read much, but I always feel shy about what I’m reading. Especially if it’s not something super ‘exciting’. If it’s a best-selling thriller or an exciting science-fiction novel, it’s easier for me to blab about it. But if I’m reading a contemporary coming of age novel or a nonfiction text on some transient niche interest of mine (this week it’s a history book, last week it was about music), I can get a bit shy. I’m curious what other people’s experiences are with this.*</p>\n\n<p>*Rephrased this question from my earlier removed post to encourage discussion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
