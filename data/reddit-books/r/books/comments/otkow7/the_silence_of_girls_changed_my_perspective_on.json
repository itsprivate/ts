They were gentle souls who in another universe, would have been soulmates. Patroclus depicts Achilles as headstrong, but caring. Stubborn, but loving. He depicts him as a man with a soul who is destined for greatness that destroys his chances at love. I couldn&#39;t help but feel Patroclus&#39; admiration for Achilles, and his frustration.</p>\n\n<p>When I read The Silence of Girls, that perspective changed. Barker describes him as a cruel and apathetic man, who falls much more easily into the role of a conquerer than the story told in The Song of Achilles. Her brutal depiction of sexual violence that occurs in the camps is unflinching, something that is sometimes glossed over in SOA. By the end of the novel, I felt sick even thinking that I had empathized with such a character. When I tried to reread SOA to compare, I found I couldn&#39;t get through it a second time, knowing how well Achilles was described.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else had a similar experience while reading the two books? Any other thoughts on the varying depictions of Achilles in the two novels? If one thing is for certain, the two completely different perspectives of the same character who has (essentially) the same plot and story in both novels, shows how talented Barker and Miller are at their craft.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
