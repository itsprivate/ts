I&#39;ve been reading for at least 1 hour every 4 out of 7 days. And in the last 4 days, since I have a few holidays, I&#39;ve reading for about 3-5 hours a day. At first I didn&#39;t think I would be able to read for that long. But now I&#39;ve read most of the Enderverse books, a few novellas and LOTR with The Hobbit and I&#39;m in the middle of reading a long fantasy series. I hope more people read books. I&#39;ve even able to get my brother interested in reading.</p>\n\n<p>Reading has helped my mental health alot too. I had some kind of mental disorder but now it&#39;s symptoms have kind of vanished. I&#39;m going to be reading a lot of books in the coming years and I hope to get my cousins interested in it too.</p>\n\n<p>I have got a lot of recommendations from the posts on this subreddit. And I think after completing this series, I&#39;m going to read The Count Of Monte Cristo. Which has appeared in a lot of posts recently.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
