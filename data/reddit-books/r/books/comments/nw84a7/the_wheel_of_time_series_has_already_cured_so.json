I have a career that requires a lot of reading, and it is hard to get motivated to read for fun.\n\nRecently, I decided to give it another try with the Wheel of Time series. I came in with low expectations on my ability to tackle such a lengthy series, but I read good things about the writing style and story telling, so I gave it a try. I finished the first book (over 600 pages) in less than two weeks. The writing does such a great job of slowly introducing potential danger only to jump out at you with immediate danger. The characters are likeable and relatable. For the first time ever, I find myself unable to put a book down. I tell myself I will read 10 pages or one chapter at night, then finally go to bed after 100 pages or more. I actually woke up this morning wanting to watch the next episode of this story, only to have to remind myself that it was not a show, but a book that I was able to picture mentally as vividly as if on screen.\n\nI am 200 pages into the second book (The Great Hunt) and cannot adequately express how enjoyable these books are. This may be a turning point for me with reading for leisure, and I can't give enough thanks to Robert Jordan, the author of the series. I know the later books were written by another offer due to Jordan's death, but if the rest are near as good as what I have read so far, I will read this whole series.",
