There were some bone chilling scenes and one or two that got my heart racing a little, as I said all of which were towards the end.\n\nThe book raised a lot of questions and I can’t help but wallow over what it *could’ve* been. I think the film did a spectacular job at bringing that mysterious and sinister world to life a bit more than it was explored in the book. \n\nHowever: it is a children’s book. And as a children’s book it is scary, but perfectly fairytale-esque, and the simpler writing style makes it easier for a younger audience to digest, which is completely sensible in my opinion. \n\nFrom that perspective the book is a good, short read that gives us a transient glimpse into an insidious and crafty fictional world—4/5 stars would recommend.",
