Because of these situations my inner child that hated to share is coming out. I never thought I could feel this protective of my things again until I let her borrow 2 of my books over a month ago. She still hasn’t given them back and I know she will eventually but man do I hate that she has them. She gave me 2 of her books to read in exchange but I returned them right after finishing them hoping she’d do the same - but clearly I’m the only obsessive one. She’s recently asked to borrow another one of my books and I got so triggered I didn’t even reply to her message. The audacity to want to borrow another book before even returning my other ones (one of them shes read and the other one she’s no longer interested in reading) !!! I feel like a child rn lol - it shouldn’t be that serious but I’m a little selfish esp when it comes to my books. I want them all on my bookshelf at all times. But I feel extremely awkward saying no U cannot borrow my books bc I don’t like to share my books. If anyone else feels the same or if you have any advice lmk lol I feel like this is something I should work on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
