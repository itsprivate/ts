With Covid restrictions and overall lack of enthusiasm for the holiday, my wife and I immediately ruled out trying to go out to dinner somewhere and spend a bunch of money. \nWe’re trying to build up our library and read more. My wife suggested that we go to the bookstore and buy each other books instead of unnecessarily buying chocolates and flowers and all the hoopla. We decided on picking one of the others choosing and one dealers choice. This is now my new favorite thing we’ve done.\nI share this because I figured I’d find some common practices on this sub and the overall love for buying/receiving new books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
