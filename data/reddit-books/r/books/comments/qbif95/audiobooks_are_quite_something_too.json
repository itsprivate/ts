Before that, I needed time and a suitable silent environment to enjoy reading. Chores which previously were occupying my time are now not only barrable but also not meaningful when I can listen to audiobooks in the meantime. Whenever I go a run, travel to places, or do boring but necessary activities I can use that time which I thought was wasted on obligatory activities. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t discriminate anyone who reads books, I myself still enjoy my free time with an excellent book and a cup of tea, but audiobooks allow me to change some of my miserable time into something beautiful and interesting.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
