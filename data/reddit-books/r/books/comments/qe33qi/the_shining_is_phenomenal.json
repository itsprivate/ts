It really creeped me out and I had a perpetual sense of unease while reading it. I felt like I was being watched for a long time after I was done reading the book. The characters were great. I loved Hallorran&#39;s character the most. \nThe thing I liked best though, was the way the stream of consciousness was written. In brackets with no line breaks or periods, it was a really cool experience. \nI look forward to watching the movie (I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s great too) and reading more of Stephen King&#39;s works.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
