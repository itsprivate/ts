  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time. We’ve all heard that liking this novel is a “red flag” and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel. </p>\n\n<p>As someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He’s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it’s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: “that kind of stuff&#39;s happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can&#39;t stand it.”</p>\n\n<p>I feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn’t this very obviously a trauma response to unspeakable suffering? The novel’s approach to sexual violence doesn’t even begin and end with Holden - it permeates the novel, from Jane to the sex worker Holden meets to the sexual violence/aggression Holden knows his peers enact against other students and girls he knows. </p>\n\n<p>It’s a really weird “flex” that people think dunking on Holden or readers who identify with him is impressive. Do people realize that CSA survivors, especially boys who are far less likely to speak up about their abuse, may see themselves in Holden? Are they aware that finding Holden annoying for whining or being pretentious or jaded or depressed just perpetuates the idea that the only good victims of abuse are the noble, palatable ones (ie the ones that don’t actually exist outside of movies)? What do y’all think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
