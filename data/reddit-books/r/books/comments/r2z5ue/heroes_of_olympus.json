I actually prefer this series to the Percy Jackson’s and want more people to know about it</p>\n\n<p>The books still include the regular crew, Percy, Annabeth, Charon but it introduces 5 new heroes, some Greek, some Roman! The Greeks are Leo, Jason and Piper. The Romans are Frank, Hazel and kinda Jason too (the book explains better than I could sos) </p>\n\n<p>These 7 are on the quest that the prophecy that ended the last Percy Jackson book. The people trying to prevent this are Gaia, the earth herself and her children, the giants. Gaia is trying to wake and shake the world of her back and the giants are eliminating anyone trying to lull her back to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Each book is considerably long with the shortest one being 500 pages and there’s five books but over those 2600 pages, it tells one of the greatest stories I’ve read in awhile. It’s a little bit dumbed down for the younger target audience but still it’s a great story. There’s a fair bit of romance in the books but it doesn’t intrude on the story and helps the characters develop together in a fantastic way.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to spoil much so im going to end it here but I seriously suggest you give the series a try</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
