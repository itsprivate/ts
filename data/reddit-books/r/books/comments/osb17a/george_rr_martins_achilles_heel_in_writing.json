He also claims he is a slow writer. And I disagree with that. From 1996 to 2000 he published the first 3 books, which are masterpieces.

He kept having branches sprout from the tree trunk of the central story and those branches started growing smaller branches. He should have been cutting off branches, not making new ones after book 3. &quot;I don&#39;t like to know where the story is going when I write&quot; I love you George, but sometimes you need to know when you have enough story. And you had enough by book 3.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
