The adventures the little prince go on talk about love, bonds, life, and shows “adult” behavior in the eyes of a child. The prince meets adults who do things that are absurd to him. For example: he meets a man who believes he owns the stars yet spends all his time counting them, for the sake of becoming richer so he can “buy more” stars. The prince simply wanders off after asking a few questions, commenting on how strange adults are. I won’t speak much more about the plot because I don’t want to just give my summary, but by the time I had finished the book I was in tears! Few books have moved me to tears the way the little prince has. It’s a very easy read and I cannot suggest it enough, whether you’re 9 or 90 there’s something to find in this book!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
