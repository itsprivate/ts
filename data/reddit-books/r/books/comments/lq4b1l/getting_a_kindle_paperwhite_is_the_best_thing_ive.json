I love how compact it is and that I can carry my entire library on one device with the sole purpose being for reading. It doesn&#39;t strain my eyes and being able to change the font and instantly look up words(which a real book can&#39;t do of course) is just so convenient to me and I&#39;ve also bought a cute case which allows me to position it to stand up on surfaces. I love this little Paperwhite with all of my soul, it truly makes me read a lot more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
