I did some research after finishing the book and I found out that it's based on historical facts, many things actually happened.  Without going into details I have to say that it's an amazing book, but it comes with a certain heaviness. I'm taking some time processing it. I had been told that it was strong (I lack a better word) but I didn't think it could be this strong. So in my opinion, it is one of those books that you have to read, but be careful, it could be too much and leave you with a very bad feeling.",
