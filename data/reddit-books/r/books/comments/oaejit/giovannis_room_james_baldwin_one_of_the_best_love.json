  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is the first work of fiction from James Baldwin that I&#39;ve read and I was very impressed with its restraint and emotional power. It tells the story of a young American named David who lives aimlessly in Paris among the clientele of a local gay bar. David develops a general loathing of everyone and cannot seem to find his place in the world or find love. Baldwin makes it very clear that his protagonist is bisexual, but the homosexual themes of the plot are almost secondary to the way his characters navigate the Parisian cityscape as vulnerable, culturally ambivalent wanderers with too much time and not enough money. David struggles between his desire to place himself in heteronormative society, and his desire to be sexually fulfilled by men. He finds himself torn between his New World sincerity and the ironic distance of the Old World. </p>\n\n<p>The second part of the book is definitely the strongest. Arguments are profound, but the quiet moments between the flareups also resonate with cinematic-like poetry. Characters grapple with their future, but the central dilemma of the novel continues to linger far beyond the novels&#39; scope.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it was a fantastic read and I am very interested in reading more fiction by James Baldwin in the future. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952068467\">WorldCat</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
