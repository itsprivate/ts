I absolutely loved that book, and it was amazing every page. I don&#39;t remember being frustrated by the hidden knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, I just started <em>Lake of the Woods</em> by Tim O&#39;Brien. This is not really a spoiler, since it happens in the first ten pages - the &quot;plot&quot; starts off when someone writes a hit piece that tanks the main character&#39;s political ambitions. I&#39;m about 60 pages in, and it is becoming more clear that the book is going to jump around the hit piece for the rest of the book, likely without revealing its contents until the end. It&#39;s already making me frustrated because I just want to know. Maybe my patience has gotten worse since reading <em>The God of Small Things.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I was just interested in seeing what others thought. It&#39;s a framing device that I could see leading to reader frustration, as the only reason for the mystery is an intentional plot device by the author. There is no built in explanation for why the reader wouldn&#39;t know it. But, in the right hands, it can be a wonderful framing device that sucks you in and makes you feel like you are learning a forbidden secret that the characters won&#39;t even acknowledge to themselves.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
