I plan and hope to make friends, but even with friends there’s only so much time you can spend before you just want to read a book and escape to another world for a while.\n\nI thought about the library but that’s a no go as there’s no way to return them, or even extend the rental from inside as internet and such is non-grata.\n\nSo I was wondering if someone had any advice? I imagine there has to be people with books they wouldn’t care to get rid of, I know when I read Game of Thrones I kept forgetting to bring it to work and I’d just buy another copy cause I couldn’t wait my whole shift to read the next chapter. I must’ve ended up with 2-3 copies of each book and probably four copies of the first one. That was years ago though when I was still working as a paramedic and could afford to buy a book just to avoid having to go all day without reading.\n\nOh how times have changed.\n\nAny advice, recommendations, or thoughts would be truly appreciated. I’ll be honest, I’m absolutely terrified at the idea of doing this but frankly I’m out of options and this is my last hope of getting things together.\n\nAlso, if anyone’s spent time in a similar setting I’d love to hear any advice or thoughts you have.",
