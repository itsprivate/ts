I grabbed a couple of books and as I was preparing to pay them, I see there&#39;s an October promotion where they give away a book if you buy for more than 25$. Sure, why not! So I pay for my books and the lady gives me a book, I put it in a bag and go on my way. Home, I realize that the book is actually an Advance Reader&#39;s Edition of a book that will be released in a few days. On the back it says it&#39;s part of a &quot;National publicity and marketing campaign&quot;.  It even states it&#39;s a hardcover but it&#39;s a actually a paperback, so basically not the final product. No barcode either.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I found the whole thing fascinating and was wondering whether bookstores do such things frequently with advance copies. It might be a very common thing I simply had not stumbled upon before. I just needed to share it with someone!</p>\n\n<p>The book itself is &quot;This is Ear Hustle : Unflinching Stories of Everyday Prison Life&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Edit : Thank you all for the responses, I learned quite a bit about ARCs today!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
