My love of reading has been rekindled thanks to this sub and others like it. Erin Morgenstern kicked off my year with “The Starless Sea” and I was absolutely infatuated with the story and her writing. Shortly after i read Madeline Miller’s “Circe” and was again blown away. I followed that up with The Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden and fell in love with the world she created in those three books. The sixth book was “And Then There Were None” by renowned author Agatha Christie and immediately saw why she was so well regarded. Coming in at number 7 was a book that was long overdue my attention, “The Fellowship of the Ring”. I grew up watching those movies every weekend, but there is something about Tolkien’s writing that almost feels religious. His writing paired with the beloved story I already knew created one of the best reading experiences of my life. Numbers 8-12 have felt like a strange fever dream, to think I had never heard of Discworld up until a few weeks ago is nothing short of a damn shame. Terry Pratchett has changed the way I think about literature, I know that sounds a bit over the top but it’s true. His style of comedy mixed with the philosophical ideas he puts forward come together to create something... magical. (Sorry)\n\nI have met my goal and I feel great about it, but what feels even better is knowing that I’ve found an old friend in reading. Thank you to this sub and others like it for contributing largely to my success. \n\nHappy reading!",
