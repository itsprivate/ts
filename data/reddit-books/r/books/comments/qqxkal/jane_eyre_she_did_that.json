The best part of the book is honestly her character because the boldness of her spirit, her passion, and agency really struck a chord in me — it felt so modern for a book set in that era. I can imagine how groundbreaking this must have been. I can totally see why her character and this book has resonated with so many readers. </p>\n\n<p>While I’m not a big fan of the Jane and Rochester relationship, you just can’t help but root for her to be happy in love and I think Brontë triumphed with really letting us in her head. She is unashamed to love, and the juxtaposition of her internalizing and how she speaks and acts when it comes to matters of the heart, show how she is so nuanced as a character. </p>\n\n<p>I also dig the gothic vibe of this with the environment acting as a parallel to the emotions, hearing voices through the wind. </p>\n\n<p>This is my second Brontë book after finishing Wuthering Heights recently, and I am very impressed. While I love the character work here, I also enjoyed Wuthering’s plot with all the complicated characters and extreme melodrama. Any recommendations on what Bronte book I should read next?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
