But now that I&#39;m an adult myself, I found myself wondering for the first time, what would Anne say if she knew so many people were reading her private thoughts? I recently reread some of my old diaries from when I was a teenager and they were so cringey to me that I wanted to burn them all!</p>\n\n<p>Anne&#39;s diary, of course, seems way more readable than my own (and way more historically significant), but do you think she would be embarrassed if she knew everyone else was reading it? Or maybe proud? I know she said that she didn&#39;t think anyone would be interested in it, but I wonder how she would feel to know that so many people actually are!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
