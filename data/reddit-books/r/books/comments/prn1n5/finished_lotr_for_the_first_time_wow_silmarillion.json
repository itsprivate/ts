I never watched the movies so everything was experienced for the very first time. God, it was quite an adventure and I laughed, cried, thought about the story every moment of everyday even when I wasn’t reading it. It is now a precious part of my bookshelf. I could talk about this forever but I need help about what to do next. </p>\n\n<p>So, I bought the next books of Tolkien’s work up to Unfinished Tales. I want to start the Silmarillion next but I’d also maybe like to take a break and read some other things since LOTR was a lot for me emotionally. With school too, the universe of Middle-Earth can be a little draining to explore for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>Is The Silmarillion something that I have to read with LOTR information fresh in my mind? Or is it completely separate and I can read it in a few months from now? My issue is that even though I want to continue to immerse myself in the universe, I might need a break and read some lighter novels. I just don’t want to go back into Tolkien’s world completely confused and struggling to get through his next books because I hear the Silmarillion is a tough read.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
