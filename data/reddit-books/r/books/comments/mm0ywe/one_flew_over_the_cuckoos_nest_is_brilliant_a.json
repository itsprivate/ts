I’m having a blast coming up with my own interpretations of it and reading others’ online. \n\nThe book was great, Kesey did a fantastic job with the characters and created one of the best “villains” I’ve seen in a book with Nurse Ratched. You can’t help but simultaneously hate her, but also understand that she’s just doing her job (which in her case can mean doing great harm to patients, but I digress). In fact, most characters in the book have a similar level of dimension to them; McMurphy is a sociopath but ironically is the glue that holds the group together emotionally, making them experience joy and live free of the often arbitrary rules placed on them by the institution. \n\nI also like how the book is about mental institutions on the surface, but the whole thing can be read as a much deeper metaphor for society. Ratched and the mental institution represent society and McMurphy represents non-conformity. It’s brilliant how seamless the metaphor fits, because the power structure of a mental institution at the time is similar to society depending on your perspective of the latter. I’m sure this explanation of the book has been worn over the last 59 years, so I need not go into detail here. \n\nAs a piece of social commentary, this book is some of the best I’ve read, up there with 1984 and Brave New World for me. As a side note, the movie was great too, Jack Nicholson was an excellent choice for McMurphy. All in all, as a zoomer who mainly watches YouTube and plays games, it’s been refreshing and extremely enjoyable to read such a masterpiece. It’s testament to how timeless the book truly is when some schmuck like me can pick it up over half a century later and still glean some meaning of modern relevancy from it.",
