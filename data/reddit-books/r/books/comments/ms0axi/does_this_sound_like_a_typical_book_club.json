Guess what, everyone (including the girl who suggested the book!) in our last meeting was complaining about the overuse of slang and cliche rom-com plot - well duh!\n\nLike I said I don't expect to read the War and Peace of the 21st century in this club, all I want is to unwind with an easy read and then discuss it with likeminded people. However, even though I enjoyed reading most of our books (even ones that are outside my comfort zone) after our meetings I find myself not liking the book so much anymore after listening to them tear it apart. I'm starting to think that the people in our club either don't actually like reading or are too pretentious for the books we choose, so in trying to please both parties we fail everyone.\n\nJust wanted to check with other bookworms if this sounds like your typical book club experience. Do book clubs tend to be full of criticism about the book or is it supposed to be more balanced?",
