Which is to say that I'm the author of eight books of fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. That includes my new novel [*How to Mars*](https://tachyonpublications.com/product/how-to-mars/) (Tachyon Publications)\\*—\\*my debut in the world of science-fiction. So, as far as writing goes, I've been at it for a little while, and, as far as sci-fi goes, I'm new around here. Either way, I'm looking forward to talking! \n\nI started writing *How to Mars* in 2015, inspired by news stories about the kind of bonkers [Mars One Project](http://www.mars-one.com/) (like the fictional organization in my novel, their plan was to send a bunch of folks on a one-way mission to the red planet and fund the whole thing via a reality TV show—but my (fake) organization actually did it!), and I was also inspired by that ongoing preoccupation with the human condition of mine. (Kirkus Reviews calls the book \"A poignant examination of what it means to be human.\" Which is very nice of them. The equally kind folks at Publisher's Weekly call the novel \"funny, fresh, and winsome.\") Crucially, Mars One and my organization both had the same ironclad rule: No sex on Mars. But my novel begins \"This is how I find out Jenny is pregnant on Mars,\" so you can see how that rule worked out.\n\nBeyond the writing, I also teach creative writing and literature at Georgetown University, and live with my family in Washington, DC. You can find out more about me at [davidebenbach.com](http://davidebenbach.com/) or on social media; I'm on Facebook (@DEbenbach), Twitter (@debenbach), and Instagram (@davidebenbach).
