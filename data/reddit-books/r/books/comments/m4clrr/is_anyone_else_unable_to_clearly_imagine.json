My mind for some reason is very stubborn with faces and refuses to imagine a face that it doesn't already know. When I try to make a new face based on the author's description it inevitably turns into the face of someone I've recently been thinking about. To avoid frustration I've settled on imagining most characters as actors that I feel would be fitting for the role. In this way, with every book I read, I end up unwillingly creating my dream cast for the movie adaptation.\n\nAnyone else have this? How vividly can you imagine faces? And are you able to create totally new faces?",
