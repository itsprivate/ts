I immediately bought a paperback copy of Strange & Norrell at my local used bookstore for $5.\n\nWhile I still have 300 pages to go, I feel compelled to share these references with you all now. \n\n1. A Conversation Between Strange & Norrell on the Possibility of Interdimensional Travel via Enchanted Mirrors (p. 484, Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.)\n\n\"This would not have ordinarily been a subject to please Mr Norrell, but he was so relieved to discover that Strange did not intend to quarrel with him about the library at Hurtfew that he grew quite communicative. 'Oh yes, indeed! There is indeed a path which joins all the mirrors of the world. It was well-known to the Great Mediaevals. No doubt they trod it often. I fear I cannot give you any more precise information. The writers I have seen all describe it in different ways. Ormskirk says it is a road across a wide, dark moor, whereas Hickman calls it a vast house with many dark passages and great staircases. Hickman says that within this house there are stone bridges spanning deep chasms and canals of black water flowing between stone walls -- to what destination or for what purpose no one knows.'\"\n\n2. Strange's Remarks to Childermass on illustrations made for his book, 'The History and Practice of English Magic', illustrations depicting \"great corridors built more of shadows than any thing else\",  a \"vast, dark moor\", and \"dark openings in the walls suggest[ing] other corridors appearing to be inside of a labyrinth\". (p. 698)\n\n\"Of course,\" remarked Strange to Childermass, \"they make these scenes altogether too Roman -- too like the works of Palladio and Piranesi, but they cannot help that -- it is their training. One can never help one's training, you know. As a magician I shall never quite be Strange -- or, at least, not Strange alone -- there is too much Norrell in me.\"\n\n\nTL;DR : Susanna Clarke clearly was affected by Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi long before she wrote 'Piranesi'. She references his work in 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell', paying homage to the fact that his art has had a clear and present influence on her own creative genius.\n\nEdit: Not sure if this qualifies as a 'spoiler' or not. Playing it safe.",
