He creates a world which is something more than it seems at first description. Every seems both a lie and the truth at the same time, does the main character really reverse death or was the recipient really dead, or merely wounded? Plus the world building is magical, Urth a planet with a sun so close to death the stars are visible in the daytime sky. It&#39;s fantastic. </p>\n\n<p>His fantasy works like The WizardKnight, and Latro in the Mist are beyond good as well. So if you&#39;re not down with sci fi a good Arthurian tale my be just what you need.
