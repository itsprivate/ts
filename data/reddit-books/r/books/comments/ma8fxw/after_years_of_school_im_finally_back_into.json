They became deadweight as we moved from city to city. A few months into my first real job, I finally found free time. I decided to get back to into reading. I wanted to get back into sci-fi. This was spurred on by the amazing movies of recent (Interstellar, Gravity, The Martian, and yes even the recent Star Wars movies) as well as the excitement over last year's NASA astronaut apps and all the Artemis/Mars missions.\n\nI picked up **Artemis** by Andy Weir about a civilization on the Moon, and it was so much fun. It has been years since I read a book fully (the last was actually The Martian) and it took so much time and energy to experience this book. But it was so worth it.\n\nI continued to reading **Ready Player One**, then the first Expanse book (**Leviathan Wakes**), and now I'm on the **Three-Body Problem**. My reading speed has picked up a bit, my endurnace too, and everything in my life seems to have changed. My phone time is down, my sleep is better, and I have more energy. Our toddler is also picking up books more I think cuz she sees us reading. But the best is that special feeling you get when you're completed immersed in a book. **That indescribable high.** Honestly, I haven't felt that way since high school, since I never read more than a book a year since then. That connection and compassion for the characters that even the best movies or TV shows can't do (well, The Expanse show comes close). It is such a special experience that I really hope my generation and Zoomers come back to books. You really can't replicate it through other mediums.\n\nMy advice to those whose reading careers have been stymied by their work careers is to find that time and keep reading! Even if for just 5 minutes. Forget having to make it difficult literature, just find something that is fun for you. It will be so difficult at first anyway. But keep at it. After a few months, it has transformed into a **brain massage**.",
