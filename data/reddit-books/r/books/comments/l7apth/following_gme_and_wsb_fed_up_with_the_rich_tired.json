Literally forced off their own land because someone with deeper pockets and bigger financial interests just wanted them out of the way.\n\nThis book is unfortunately the timeless American tale of how the rich will betray the poor and how the poor try to survive against impossible odds. It might give you hope. It might resonate with the resentment you already feel. It might give you a framework to understand or explain your reaction to what we've seen in the United States in the recent past. You might find Grapes full of shocking double standards, where the rich get a different set of rules (read: the rich have fewer rules). You might be stunned at how a novel from 80 years ago accurately describes what we still see today.\n\nGet radicalized with me, and read The Grapes of Wrath.",
