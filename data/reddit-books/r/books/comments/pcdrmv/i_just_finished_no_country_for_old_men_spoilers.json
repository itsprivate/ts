I&#39;ve been reading about 50 pages a day for the past few days and I just finished it. I am sitting here in a total daze, hardly even able to think. Not only was it an incredible narrative that, as cheesy as it sounds, made me excited to turn every page, but my sense from the movie was correct -- it was so thematically rich</p>\n\n<p>Moss is, I think, made out to be the main character, but Bell is the one who drives the story and the themes home. I am so glad the book followed him after Moss&#39;s death, Carla Jean&#39;s death, and even Chigurh&#39;s escape. It helped put the conflict of the book into perspective. It was a wonderful vehicle to explore what it meant, and reflect on what it means for the wider world. I love how the book paints this wide despair for an America slowly crumbling into immorality and crime, and simultaneously the slow breaking down of Bell&#39;s faith in humanity, yet at the same time looks at another side of Bell, this very personal, individual, optimistic, broken hope that he has to leave something better behind him than what he sees around him. He can&#39;t deny the horrors that surround him on a daily basis, but in order to keep some spark of hope alive, he sees those little, yet hugely significant things in his life. His uncle. His wife. The little carved out rock in the yard</p>\n\n<p>This book seems to be a perfect microcosm of growing older. Whether you mean just a person, or the world as a whole. Watching the world you were familiar with slowly transform into something unfamiliar and disturbing. Losing what you thought you knew and trying not to lose yourself along with it. I&#39;m beyond impressed with this book. I&#39;m sure I will read it again and again</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just wanna quickly mention that Chigurh is one of the most genuinely chilling villains I&#39;ve seen or read in anything. He is a Darth Vader level villain. And Javier Bardem was the absolute perfect casting for him</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
