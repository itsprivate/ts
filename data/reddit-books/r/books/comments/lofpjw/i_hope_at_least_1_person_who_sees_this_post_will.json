I  thought I should write this down before it's diluted by a night's sleep.\nFirst off, I'm not a fan of love stories, and I try to stay away from them as much as possible. So I went into TSOA without much expectations (after the endless nudges from every place I look for book recommendations). Also, I was pretty sure I'll leave it halfway through, because of the size of the book (my attention span is usually worse than that of a toddler). Yet, I have surprised myself and managed to finish the book at breakneck speed for the following reasons:\n1. The story is beautifully narrated by this very simple character, Patroclus; not a hero, not a demigod, and he certainly has no discernible skills to showcase. It's not like one of those stories where the the unassertive narrator is actually oh-so-amazing and there is some grand scheme brewing to reveal this. Achilles loves Patroclus for just being himself and not for some particular virtue of his. \n2. Achilles is painted in a much more colourful light than the usual hues of war and greatness. Well, he is definitely portrayed as a hero, but in addition to that, he is being observed through the eyes of a lover, who brings us things that neither a comrade nor a bard can do justice with.\n\nI would not call myself a \"voracious\" reader, and I'm sure there a million other beautiful books like these that I have not even heard of. However, I have written this hoping someone who's put off reading TSOA will get to it ASAP, and someone who has a weekend to spare will give this a try and see how it goes, because I really enjoyed every single bit of it. That's it. Peace out.\n\nEdit: I think I'm like Patroclus and the book is like Achilles. I'm madly in love with it, so I'm blind to most of its flaws. Those of you who have read it, feel free to point 'em out; I'm open to all kinds of views.",
