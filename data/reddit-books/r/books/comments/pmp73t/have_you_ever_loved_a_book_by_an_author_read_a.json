Midbook, I seriously thought I should just give up and read something else. However, there was a little voice in my head reminding me what a masterpiece the first book is.  Surely, the ending of the second book would be worth it and I&#39;d be glad for having persisted, right? So I persisted.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I hadn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m not sure if I want to read more books by her or not :( I feel so conflicted. I still love the first book. It clicked with me, but I kinda wish I could simply wipe the second book out of my memory. I don&#39;t want to read another book just to be disappointed, and at the same time, I wonder if I&#39;m missing a great adventure. I don&#39;t know what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Has this ever happened to you? Have you read more books by this author you loved-hated, or decided to give up? Do you regret your decision?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
