Before then, I&#39;ve always been one of those <em>&quot;I must focus on each word and nothing else or I will get lost&quot;</em> kind of kid. I could not afford anything else happening in my head other than my own voice saying the words or else I&#39;d lose track of what would be happening. But now, I have aquired this...hmm... would &#39;Skill&#39;? be too pretentious a word? I don&#39;t know but it feels like I&#39;ve gone to the next level of reading! </p>\n\n<p>So, it all started with the Grapes of Wrath which I finished a few days ago. Everytime I opened the book, the &quot;movie&quot; would start playing and it was so consistent and concrete.</p>\n\n<p>GOP felt like an entire film playing in my head. From page one to the last. I guess, with practice, I was able to envision how character would look, how they would sound, what the lighting of each scene would like, the location, the &quot;close up shots&quot; of certatain conversations and monologues and what music would be playing. All this as I read. It was..sooo...goddamn enjoyable!! I have have felt so immersed before.</p>\n\n<p>I also just finished the Raymond Carver short story - &#39;Preservation&#39; only minutes ago! And duuuude lol, It took me like 15 minutes to finish but it felt like a proper short film was happening right there in my head! I envisioned what the house looked like, their accents, their facial expressions, and of course the music!</p>\n\n<p>Now, I want to go back and re-read all my favourite books! I feel so happy right now lol. I&#39;ve always loved reading but now it feels like I&#39;ve aquired this next level love everyone is always talking about!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
