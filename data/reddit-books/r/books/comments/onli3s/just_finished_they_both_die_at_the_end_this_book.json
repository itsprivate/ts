It gets progressively sadder and it shatters your heart a million little times, there were some segments where I was just uncontrollably crying.</p>\n\n<p>This book has a much more difficult task to do because it has to keep you intrigued while you know exactly how it’s gonna end, and it does such a wonderful job sinking you in that you can’t even put it down, I’m sorry if I’m being overdramatic but I just can’t fully express how much I loved this book.</p>\n\n<p>I was going through a bit of a rough patch when I started the book and in the weirdest way, their tragedy made me get through a lot of stuff and appreciate my life a lot more. I connected to the characters on such a deep level that I don’t think I’m ever gonna forget Mateo and Rufus.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
