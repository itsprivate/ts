We are a small reading community called r/ClassicBookClub, and we read and discuss a chapter of a classic book each day in a dedicated spoiler free discussion thread. \n\nOur readers nominate and vote on the books we read, and the winning book for our next read is The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas. We are currently working our way through Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and will begin The Three Musketeers on March 22nd. \n\nPinned at the top of our subreddit is the Announcement post for The Three Musketeers and there is some info on translations in the comments if you would like to check that out. \n\nOur first rule for books that we read is they must be in the public domain and we provide links to free versions from Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, and audiobooks from Librivox. Readers are free to choose any translations they want, and read in any language they are comfortable with. \n\nIn our sidebar you’ll find links for our current book, our rules, a link to our discussion archive, and links to our family of subreddits.\n\nWe just hit 1000 subscribers and would love to keep growing. So if reading one chapter of classic literature a day and discussing it with a group of fellow readers interests you, then come check us out. The Three Musketeers should be quite the adventure! \n\nIf you have any questions please let me know, and I wish you all happy reading!",
