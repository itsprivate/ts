(The author has a PhD in Byzantine history.) </p>\n\n<p>However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to most people because the books are all basically travelogues; there&#39;s no real central plot or conflict to most of them, and in some ways it&#39;s like reading a novelized version of a game of The Oregon Trail. Day 38, sighted by pirates, chose to fight, managed to force them to flee. It&#39;s not that bad, but it&#39;s certainly not anything I&#39;d call suspenseful. </p>\n\n<p>So what are some books that you enjoyed, but you never get the chance to bring up in recommendation threads because they&#39;re too niche, too weird, too obscure, or just something that most people wouldn&#39;t bother to read?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
