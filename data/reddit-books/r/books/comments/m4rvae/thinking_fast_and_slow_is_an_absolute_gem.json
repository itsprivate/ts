Now I don't want to talk about the specific which I want people to find by themselves by reading this book. I honestly think this is the best non-fiction book I have read so far in my life and let me digress here for a moment and allow me to express gratification for being capable to read and comprehend English. I am going through a rough phase im my life right now and often wonder how things would have different had I not followed the set of actions that put in my current predicament but I seldom reflect on how even a slight deviation from the sets of action I followed might have resulted into a completely different being, prompting to wonder whether I really prefer to live a different life? So yeah, this book is one of those book that can make us fellow readers marvel at our own brilliance regardless of the circumstances. Also, owing to the practical nature of the book, it can help us being 'rational' in the truest sense and if not, it can atleast make us less ignorant and modest of the limitations of Homo Sapiens.",
