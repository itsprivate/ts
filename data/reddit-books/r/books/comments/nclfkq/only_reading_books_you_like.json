It bothers me when popular media demonizes this idea, like you're doing something wrong by working hard to read a difficult classic or a new genre that you don't particularly enjoy. Don't get me wrong, I think that leisure reading should be enjoyable, but I also think it's very limiting to only read books that fascinate you from the start. Some of the best reading I've done was with books I never thought I'd like or that bored me when I first started. Does anyone feel the same way?",
