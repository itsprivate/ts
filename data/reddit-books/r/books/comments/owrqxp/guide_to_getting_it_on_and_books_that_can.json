But it&#39;s a book that teaches that sex and sexuality are natural, enjoyable things; that nonetheless carry with them a weight of respect, responsibility, maturity and knowledge. Yes, it&#39;ll talk quite openly about the sexual act, but also teach people about consent, safety, risk prevention, respect for your partner, self-exploration, to enjoy giving and receiving pleasure, and to accept your sexuality and that of other people. All in a fun and open tone. <em>That&#39;s</em> where it makes the most good, imo. It&#39;d be extremely helpful for some people, given the atrocious levels of sex education most of us receive at home or at school, and for others, it might be life-changing.</p>\n\n<p>I think the book should be required reading for every high-schooler out there, and I have actually gifted it to younger cousins that are near graduation age. If everyone read it, the world would be happier and more responsible with their sexuality, which is a huge part of the human experience, even if we don&#39;t think about it that often.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t recommend reading cover-to-cover in a sprint, like you would a novel. The book is designed to be read in parts, or a few chapters at a time. And it can be read while skipping chapters. Just look at the index and read whatever chapter interests you. Even if you&#39;re not a teenager, and you&#39;ve been having sex for years, I guarantee you&#39;ll learn something new, or get a new perspective about something in the book.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s my epiphany with this book, and why I think it&#39;s important. I&#39;d love to hear comments about it, if someone else has read it.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to know if you have read any other books that, like this one for me, you believe can have a tangible positive effect in the world, when people read it, and why.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
