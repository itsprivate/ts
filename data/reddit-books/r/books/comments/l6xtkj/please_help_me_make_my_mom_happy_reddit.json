Since you're fans of stories, I'll let you hear mine.  \n\n\nMy mother is a wonderful person. She's the most giving, caring, wonderful person I know.  A lot of people claim that their mom's are the best, but my mom really is.  Growing up, all of my friends referred to her as their mom as well, because she was the ideal mom.  She had lots of fun, quirky traits about her.  Whenever I'd bring over a friend she hadn't met, my other friends would warn them that my mom was referred to as \"The Interrogator\" because she'd ask (often wildly inappropriate) questions about them. Not because she wanted to judge them, but because she was genuinely curious about them as people.  But, that's neither here nor there.  \n\n\nMy family is extremely large, although loosely knit. So large, in fact, that there's a historical book written about the family titled 'The Moise family of South Carolina; an account of the life and descendants of Abraham and Sarah Moise who settled in Charleston, South Carolina, in the year 1791 A.D.'  Quite a mouthful, but it exists and it's totally real.  My mother, being the kind and caring person that she is, loaned that book to her mother, who then proved to be the exact opposite of my mother, and ceased all contact with her and disappeared with the book.  As of now, we've given up all hope of finding this woman and my mother's treasured heirloom.  \n\n\nMy mother has dreams of handing this book down to her son (me), and then that book travelling through future generations to her grandchildren and grandchildren's grandchildren, and so on.  The only problem is, I can't seem to find anyone who actually has the hardback version of this book.  I've exhausted as many avenues as I can count, and I'm kind of at a last ditch effort here.  I've contacted the publisher (RL Bryan Company of South Carolina), every library that has a copy of the book, and so on.  \n\n\nNow, that's not to say it's been entirely fruitless.  A woman at the St Louis Library who works in the genealogy department was absolutely incredible and scanned every single page of the book and emailed it to me, and my mother has been reading the book every day since I sent her the copies.  Alas, it isn't the same for her, even though she's extremely appreciative of it.  \n\n\nI turn to you, Redditors, internet detectives, to be my saviors.  Please, help me find the hardback copy of this book so my mother can have her heirloom back.  \n\n\nThank you, very much, in advance, even if we don't find it.",
