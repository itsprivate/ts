He was taking a course that focused solely on Ulysses, and mentioned how ridiculously specific their sessions sometimes were - in one case, the professor spent an entire lecture discussing a single semicolon in the book. Now, I haven't even read the book yet, but I've heard this anecdote a couple times now and I'm really curious to know: how could one mark of punctuation inspire around an hour's worth of discourse? And is this a commonly debated feature in the novel? Would readers recognise which semicolon this guy was talking about? I'd be so fascinated to know, if anyone can suggest which quote/passage this could have been referring to. Thanks!",
