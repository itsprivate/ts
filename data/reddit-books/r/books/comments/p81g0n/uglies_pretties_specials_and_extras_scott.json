They introduce concepts of &quot;What is free will?&quot;, &quot;What is our place in the world?&quot;,  the value of friendship versus conforming to society and how interpersonal relationships change and develop. So for new/young readers who might not have run into these concepts often, this might be especially interesting to read.</p>\n\n<p>The setting is in the future where we follow our 16 year old female protagonist through conspiracies and some surprising twists. It&#39;s not too heavy on the SciFi, so if you don&#39;t like those kinds of book, this series shouldn&#39;t scare you off.</p>\n\n<p>The three books follow the same girl but she finds herself on different sides every book so you get multiple perspectives on the world she lives in. The fourth book has a new protagonist and is more standalone.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want something fun to read over a week or so, I&#39;d recommend this one for all ages.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
