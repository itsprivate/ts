But it&#39;s a very fond parody, which is something that the best parodies usually are.</p>\n\n<p>I was surprised by the framing device, with the authors digressions about the fictional author and the book he was adapting, his fictional family and the writing business. They were funny, original and interesting, but also surprisingly bitter at times, in a tone that is not that suited for child readers, like his loveless family (although I suppose most of it would go over their heads). </p>\n\n<p>If you have 30th anniversary edition my advice is to skip the 30th and 25th anniversary introductions, and the Buttercup&#39;s Baby teaser chapter. While they are funny extras, I think when considered as part of the book they are a bit too much, and tip the balance away from the adventure. The book works better if you think of those as optional extras and not as part of the main experience.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
