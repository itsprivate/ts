They want to intrigue you and make the plot look appealing and therefore they systematically reveal little twists (or unforeseen development) that I would have rather experienced reading the book. It's very comparable to movie trailers that spoil you big chunks of the movie by wanting to grab your attention.\n\nI won't beat around the bush, my main point is back covers spoil a book. I have been spoiled by back covers. I think most notably about \"An education\" (I had no idea what that little girl would grow up to be) and \"11/22/63\" (although it doesn't spoil anything major, it pitches stuff happening as far as page 400). And those are just the very recent ones that I accidentally glanced at.\n\nBy diving into a book not even knowing the time period it takes place in or the overall direction of the plot, I can experience suspense and curiosity right from the beginning. I don't have to catch up with the first hundred pages thinking \"Well, I know what he'll be deciding, the back cover filled me in\". Right from the beginning, I piece together what it is going to be about and I have never needed a back cover.\n\nI know many of you read back covers though, because you need them. Some of you probably wonder right now how I choose my books without looking at the pitch of the story. Well, based on a recommendation system : from Reddit, or friends or the Amazon/Goodreads rating. It's not a perfect system but it is a much less revealing one. It has rarely failed me to be honest. Or at least, when a recommendation hasn't worked for me, the back cover reading wouldn't have prevented it anyway. The back cover can pitch you a premisse and never live up to it. It's not a token of guarantee. For example, I saw this sub has voted 11/22/63 as the \"best mystery thriller book of the 2010's decade\". I didn't need to read the back cover to know I ought to give it a try. The only time I'd consent to read a back cover is if I'm losing interest for a book, to check if there's any future event foreshadowed that I could be looking forward to and that would spark my curiosity back.\n\nI was wondering if other readers were also making the choice of not reading back covers or is this an unpopular opinion ?",
