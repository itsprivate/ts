Specifically:</p>\n\n<p>- Students or teachers in academia these days: what did you think of the book&#39;s portrayal of college campuses?  As some one who graduated college in 2007, I found the scenarios they detail quite disturbing.  They describe a culture of students who deem opposing ideas &quot;harmful&quot;, hunting out the ideologically impure and punishing them along with anyone who sides with them, which sounds a lot like Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution, which they also reference in the book.  Or Twitter come to life.</p>\n\n<p>- Parents: What did you think of the book&#39;s depictions child-rearing over the years: how now there is less free play and way more scheduled, adult-supervised activities.  Do you see or feel this difference?  I&#39;m not a parent so I really wonder what it&#39;s like raising kids these days.  Not easy, I&#39;m sure!</p>\n\n<p>-Anyone and everyone else: any interesting points that I left out?  Any counterarguments to the book&#39;s hypothesis?  Or agreements?  I&#39;m all ears.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
