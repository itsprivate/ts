I&#39;ve been looking for something to get me hooked onto reading again and I&#39;m pretty sure this book&#39;s done it. As always with Weir&#39;s books, there&#39;s enough real science to make the story feel real and plausible while still maintaining a really cool sci-fi atmosphere. Something about his writing style just really clicks with me. Everything about Project Hail Mary from the science, the drama, and the humor just hit right.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s hard to talk about the plot without getting into spoilers, so I&#39;m gonna hold off on that for now until I&#39;ve had more time to digest the story.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
