Though it’s not impossible (see *The Good Earth* or *The Orphan Master’s Son*).\n\nI think in recent years the Pulitzer has become more open to depictions of American life from more diverse perspectives, and I think this year, considering the fact that many of the most critically praised books of 2020 were written by non-white and/or non-male authors, there’s a pretty good chance the winner will be written from one of those perspectives.\n\nSo here are my predictions:\n\nWinner: *Deacon King Kong*\n\nShortlist: *The Night Watchman*, *Interior Chinatown*\n\nI haven’t yet read *The Night Watchman*, but I’ve read the other two, and they’re both brilliant novels.
