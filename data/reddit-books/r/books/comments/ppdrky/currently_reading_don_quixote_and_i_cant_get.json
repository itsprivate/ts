I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but the humour appears way ahead of it&#39;s time, I definitely didn&#39;t expected that. I am currently at the beginning and I still found it funny enough to give me bellyaches. Especially, since the introduction of Sanzo, he&#39;s complementary to Don Quixote&#39;s buffoonery.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I just wanted to ask how was your experience reading it and does it get better or worse from here? Also, while we&#39;re on that subject, I wanted to ask why is it that Miguel de Cervantes made it appear as if Don Quixote was a real person and not just a fictional one, is it to emphasize the theme of parody of books about chivalrous knights at that time or is there a different reason for it?</p>\n\n<p>(Just wanted to add that I have John Ormsby&#39;s translation, so let me know if I should continue or avoid reading it).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
