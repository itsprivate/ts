Literally, when we were home from the hospital, we would lay in bed together in the evenings: baby and mama cuddled up together, and me reading to them.  We had no illusions that the babies were getting anything from the books themselves, but the family experience of being together with books was amazing.  That of course transitioned into reading them age appropriate bed time stories, and them looking at picture books during the day, etc.\n\nAbout six months ago I sat them down and told them I thought they are now getting old enough to enjoy and appreciate longer chapter books, and I had a few I wanted to share with them.  I read them the first chapter of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* and they.  Were.  Captivated.  We sat in their room reading, getting at least 2/3 of the way through that book over the course of an afternoon.\n\nWe've now read all of Roald Dahl's children's books; *Charlie* remains their favorite, although they loved *Matilda, BFG, The Witches* (my personal favorite of his) and really all of them.  Then we blitzed through a David Walliams collection; *Grandpa's Great Escape* was the stand out star, but again, they enjoyed them all.\n\nLast night I took a chance and started reading them *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,* easily one of my favorite books (and series) of all time*.*  I was afraid it might be a little old for them still, or possibly even a little scary; my 6 year old in particular is sort of anxious and nervous about anything at all scary.  Again, though, they were enraptured right away, and again, we've read a good portion of it now in less than a day.\n\nY'all, I get legit choked up whenever they react audibly to the books.  They both literally *gasped* *out loud* when Charlie finds the golden ticket.  They started clapping when the Pevensies found their way into Narnia - they had been waiting eagerly for them all to go together.  I'm not afraid of emotion, but it gets in the way of reading!  My heart absolutely overflows when they react they way I did (and, sometimes, still do) when reading these books.\n\nAnyway.  Sorry if this is too off topic, or if its inappropriate for the sub, but I don't have any other social media and I had to get it off my chest.  Anyone else have beautiful, life changing experiences like this you want to share?",
