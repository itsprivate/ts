It paints an optimistic view of the universe- that it&#39;s not a cold and empty void, that humans and their simple ability to overanalyze the universe could save the world.</p>\n\n<p>Real life science is hard, it takes years of research and pointless bureaucracy. But most people who pursue science do it for that bit at the end when you finally get the knowledge and understand the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Andy Weir has filtered that tiny bit out, and filled a whole book with it.\nYou just get a sheer joy from using boring, old physics to do monumental things, like saving the human race. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve watched the movies &quot;Arrival&quot; or &quot;Interstellar&quot;, or played the game &quot;Outer Wilds&quot;, you&#39;ll know what I mean.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
