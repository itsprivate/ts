The book&#39;s condition was listed as: &quot;Condition: Used - Good&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When the book arrived, I found that the seller, or previous owner, had stuffed three dryer sheets in between the pages close to the middle of the book.  Not only did it make the book smell like dryer sheets, which it shouldn&#39;t, it also left oily stains on the adjacent pages.  Again, I want to emphasize that this was an art book.  Very few words, lots of high resolution pictures.  Presentation was 90% of the reason for the book&#39;s existence.</p>\n\n<p>My reason for posting this here and not just complaining to the seller is because I want to discourage others from damaging their books in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Books are not meant to smell like Downy.  They are meant to smell like paper, ink, and biblichor.  Photographs printed in books are not meant to have oily saccharin smelling stains over them.  They are meant to faithfully mimic the subject of the photograph.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that you, dear reader, are merely a book&#39;s temporary conservator.  If you treat your books well, they will outlive you.  Or, at the very least, they will outlive your interest in them and you will pass them along to a new enthusiast.  Please take care of them for the sake of their future owners.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n\n<p>A. Collector</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
