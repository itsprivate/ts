So for the past while I&#39;ve been reading them the stories I loved as a child. We&#39;ve gone through Enid Blyton&#39;s Book of Brownies and the Magic Faraway Tree compilation, which they loved and were utterly absorbed in. So I figured that I&#39;d move on to Roald Dahl, who I loved as a kid. </p>\n\n<p>We started with the Twits, and as I was reading it I just kept thinking &quot;I don&#39;t remember it being this dark&quot;. Eventually, the kids told me they didn&#39;t like it and were finding parts of it upsetting, so we abandoned it for James and the Giant Peach, probably my favourite as a child. So far the kids are enjoying it, we&#39;ve only got to the part where visitors are coming to look at the peach in the garden, but I&#39;m finding it incredibly dark and disturbing. There is no way that James isn&#39;t suffering from a massively traumatic mental breakdown following the death of his parents and the mental and physical abuse suffered at the hands of his aunts.
