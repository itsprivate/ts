We drove almost 2,000 miles and I read all 455 pages of Dan Brown’s Origin aloud. My throat is a bit sore, but it was a fun vacation book to read. Brown is formulaic and repetitive, but after finishing Little Women, it was just what we wanted for this trip. We figured out the “who did it” mystery about 1/4 of the in, but still enjoyed it. </p>\n\n<p>Now the challenge of picking our next read!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
