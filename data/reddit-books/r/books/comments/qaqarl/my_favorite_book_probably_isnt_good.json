It&#39;s about a girl who has a fight with her boyfriend and the next day she gets broken up with. She has to repeat that day 7 times til she &quot;gets it right.&quot; Spoiler alert she ends up with her bestfriend and most of the stuff she did in the first day is altered. like instead of trying out for softball she auditions for the school musical. The whole book is super cheesy and cliché but that&#39;s exactly why I like it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
