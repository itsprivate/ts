I picked it up years ago when I decided to venture out of my YA Fantasy comfort zone. I wanted something I could learn something from. The tv series had just started and was getting a lot of attention for its commentary on feminism, something I didn’t know much about at the time but was curious about. It took me like 6 weeks to finish it because I found it so boring and uneventful, I really had to force myself to make progress. When I finished it, I was glad I could finally understand what this book contributed to literature and why it was famous, but I thought it was a slog fest. 2 stars on Goodreads. As months and years passed I noticed I frequently thought about it. I learned more about issues it addressed, I’d reflect on this scene or that and it’s message finally took root. It has helped me realize the importance of rights, autonomy and equality. Now, I realize how much it has contributed to my life, more than maybe 95% of the books I’ve read. Recently, I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. \n\nSo now I try to push through books that I think will give me valuable knowledge or perspective. I’ve realized a lot of the displeasure comes from my unfamiliarity with the genre or style or writing, which makes it hard for me to feel engaged.

Five years ago, I never imagined I’d be enjoying either of those.",
