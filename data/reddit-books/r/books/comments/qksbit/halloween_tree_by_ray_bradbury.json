I didn’t even know he’s written a Halloween book. </p>\n\n<p>I grabbed it to read, a bit each night, with my oldest two kids (12 and 8) and we LOVED it. </p>\n\n<p>It surprises me that it doesn’t have a bigger footprint when it comes to Halloween pop culture. The book is informative, as it presents different historical influences to our contemporary Halloween (Egyptian mummies, English druids, Mexican festivals) in an epic night of flitting across time and space. </p>\n\n<p>The book’s style is also quite singular. He uses a lot of alliteration and prose rhyme. Onomatopoeia. Songs. Polysyndeton. Fragments. Extended parallelism. Complex variance of sentence structure. </p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of inclusion of literary devices in really accessible fashion - I think it could be quite effective in class (teacher hat always on). </p>\n\n<p>The kids asked why we never read it before. My daughter, the oldest and reads voraciously, said she didn’t expect it to be to weird, in a wonderful way. </p>\n\n<p>This got added to our Halloween rotational anthology. It’s been a lot of fun!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
