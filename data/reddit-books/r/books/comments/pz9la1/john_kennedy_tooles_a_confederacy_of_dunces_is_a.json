It&#39;s an absolutely hilarious novel focusing on one Ignatius J Reilly and his interactions with the inhabitants of the city of New Orleans after his mother decides he has to go to work to pay off a car the two of them damaged. (I&#39;ll admit part of the reason I love it, is because I can see a lot of myself in Ignatius)</p>\n\n<p>How it was published is an equally interesting story. The author originally wrote it in the 1960s, but every single publisher he took it to, turned it down. Sadly he fell into depression and ultimately committed suicide through carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n\n<p>However, his mother found a smeared carbon copy of the manuscript and took it to a local professor named Walker Percy who although reluctant to read it, was impressed by what he eventually read. In the end, it was published in 1980, over a decade after it&#39;s author&#39;s suicide. The following year Toole became the first posthumous winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction which shows that you should never give up on that project you&#39;re working on.</p>\n\n<p>But enough rambling from me, has anybody else read it and what did you think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
