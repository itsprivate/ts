I love being surprised by mystery stories and hate completely obvious ones, this is a reason that keeps me coming back to Agatha christie&#39;s books. I completely ruled out Mrs. Hubbard as a suspect, but my jaw dropped when I found out, I guess you should not rule out the most unlikely suspect in an Agatha Christie novel. </p>\n\n<p>I would keep reading a bad story for the characters but a good story without characters I find interesting or I&#39;m attached to is a story I wouldn&#39;t be invested in. luckily this book had the best of both worlds, great characters and a wonderful plot and mystery that I did not grow tired of. I liked other stories of christie&#39;s like five little pigs and the amazing murder of roger Ackroyd but I was not attached to the characters and found the characters of the former book rather tedious. here christie balanced a large cast in a short book and kept them interesting enough in their short interviews and I have to say I appreciated the little map of the train that I went back to every once and a while to capture the setting of the train.</p>\n\n<p>The story was amazing, I had a feeling I would love it and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t watch the movie. The fact that they all agreed to look the other way for a justified murder was also a great end. This one is one of my favorite Agatha christie books so far. next to read is and then there were none.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
