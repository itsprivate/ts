There's so much plot choices that captivated me. I love the fact that there's almost no 'completely good' characters and the ones that are I feel are necessarily  to the plot, just like how there's no good without evil. There's not one character that takes the role of main character and I love that. I've read Crime & Punishment earlier this year and really loved it, but this is even better.",
