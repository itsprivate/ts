In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One thing I have always believed in is that for as long as civilisations exist, there <em>will</em> exist a medium, a tool, that will have the ability to control the minds of the masses. It is rather scary and at times (more often than not) this tool is used for bad rather than good, in a spread of misinformation rather than awareness. </p>\n\n<p>Media will always be present, power will always reside with someone. The one thing we can do is understand the media and how the powerful make use of it to manipulate us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
