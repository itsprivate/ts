Now he's also consulting with HBO to produce the House of the Dragon and the Dunk & Egg series so it's great that he's feeling optimistic. I think it's been said in a million times but I'm really hoping to see how this contrasts with what we've seen before in the show and I'm hoping to see the final few acts of the complete story fully detailed since DnD did a poor job handling that.
