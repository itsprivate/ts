Black Wings Has My Angel by Elliott Chaze is one. I found that one at a half-price bookstore, and even though I normally don&#39;t read much noir, it just felt like a book I needed to read. Hollow by B. Catling is another. I was browsing the fantasy section at my library and found it tucked away. I hadn&#39;t read fantasy in years and didn&#39;t know what I was looking for, but once I found that book, I knew it was the one I needed to read.</p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering what other peoples&#39; &quot;random finds&quot; were. This isn&#39;t so much a recommendation post as a place to gush about that one (or two, or five) book(s) that ended up finding you and that you&#39;ll never forget.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
