It&#39;s all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you&#39;re too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There&#39;s a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there&#39;s an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn&#39;t sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll take it a step further. I don&#39;t care if main characters are diverse. If it&#39;s a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it&#39;s pandering but litterally it&#39;s all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don&#39;t even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don&#39;t care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that&#39;s not based on actual things that happened doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t bother anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Quick notes because I got pretty overwhelmed with the response.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>when I say Asian I mean people of Asian decent in the story. Not litterally from Asia in a fictional universe. Like you&#39;d describe Asian coded people in your world like how the shu are described in 6 of crows. Not put Asian products africa in your fantasy world.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don&#39;t mean only Asian or black people. It&#39;s every miniority underrepresented people in fantasy. Gay, Indian, trans, Hispanic etc etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>saying &quot;but what if they changed black Panther white isn&#39;t a gotcha. It&#39;s a really cliché disengenous argument..</p></li>\n<li><p>Diversity doesn&#39;t ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn&#39;t ever have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people.</p></li>\n<li><p>representation is important. Just because you don&#39;t personally see the value of it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t valuable.</p></li>\n<li><p>yes I have read more than one fantasy book. The fact that people would attack me and gatekeep because I haven&#39;t read your favorite series is messed up. I&#39;m just as real of a fan as you.</p></li>\n<li><p>me making this post isn&#39;t forcing diversity down your throat.</p></li>\n<li><p>saying I don&#39;t want diversity I just want good stories is just telling on yourself. Firstly, wanting both is perfectly okay. Secondly, they aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.</p></li>\n<li><p>no, &quot;just imagining the characters as whatever you want&quot; isn&#39;t an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we&#39;re talking about.</p></li>\n<li><p>asking why people still care about skin color ignores how many people can&#39;t choose to ignore their skin color. In America people are still treated differently and have very different lived experiences because of their skin color. Stop saying that like it&#39;s a obvious answer it&#39;s not and it&#39;s off topic.</p></li>\n<li><p>no wanting more diversity isn&#39;t racist.</p></li>\n<li><p>I truly don&#39;t care about karma. It can&#39;t buy me anything. I never understood reddits obsession with karma. I didn&#39;t realize there&#39;s an unwritten rule about not crossposting after a certain date. So if that bothered you I&#39;m sorry. I updated the post with the bulleted thoughts because the intention wasn&#39;t to do that. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Look man all I wanted to do here was vent about how I wanted to see more diverse fantasy but yall one one. No one should be called racist because they care about representation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
