  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Happy Spooktober!</p>\n\n<p>Gaston Leroux&#39;s <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>. A classic that has been adapted into dozens of films and decades of stage productions. Horror beyond imaginable horror abounds at the Paris Opera House as the &quot;O.G.&quot; Opera Ghost wreaks non-threatening havoc and plays spooky pranks on the new managers, until he finds ~Christine~</p>\n\n<p>Christine is a young, beautiful understudy to the actual headliner Carlotta. One night, she has to fill in and is an instant hit because she magically sings better than anyone else! Turns out she&#39;s been getting free voice lessons from the OG himself. All he asks is that she <del>write his name on her thigh</del> simply love him! She obviously does, because she&#39;s the woman in this story.</p>\n\n<p>OG, whose real name is Erik, literally lives in the basement, btw.</p>\n\n<p>Raoul (who is important because his brother is a count?) once got Christine&#39;s scarf out of the ocean. When he <em>goes to her dressing room</em> and she doesn&#39;t recognize him, this is literally how he introduces himself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and pressing a fervent kiss on the diva&#39;s hand, &quot;<em>I am the little boy who went into the sea to rescue your scarf.</em>&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and everyone laughs at him. She tells him to leave because she needs some time alone (with OG, her platinum level patron).</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the book is about Raoul trying to prove to Christine that she should love him because he <del>got her scarf that one time</del> loves her more than OG does, because OG is ugly, and OG threatening to hurt other people if Christine doesn&#39;t love <em>him</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Christine loves whoever has most recently declared their love for her.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly think this book and story have staying power only because they tell the story of two desperate men, one is rich and the other is passionate but ugly, threatening and committing violence to win the hand of a pretty girl they know nothing about. And unfortunately, <a href=\"https://people.com/music/andrew-lloyd-webber-sarah-brightman-affair-memoir/\">that&#39;s relatable.</a></p>\n\n<p>P.S. Don&#39;t miss the casual racism that flows through the book, strangling the plot with a punjab lasso, a term Leroux himself came up with to make a noose sound more foreign and exotic.</p>\n\n<p>P.P.S. I actually do want to see a modern adaptation where a trust fund edgelord and a nefarious, basement-dwelling neckbeard go toe to toe in a futile effort to win the affections of a Twitch streamer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
