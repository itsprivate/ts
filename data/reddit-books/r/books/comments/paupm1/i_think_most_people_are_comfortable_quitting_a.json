It was looking like I was going to devour the first book in one day and move on to the rest, but somewhere after the first third it slowed down exponentially as far as plot goes, and even the dialogue/writing seemed a little worse. Gone now is the element of drama - characters just say what they mean and mean what they say, the main character is flip-flopping on her opinions or repeating herself multiple times to drill something into me as a reader, and I&#39;m finding myself skimming through info dumps. </p>\n\n<p>When do I now put down the book?</p>\n\n<p>When would <em>you</em>?</p>\n\n<p>This is pretty arbitrary to answer, so I&#39;m just looking for your opinions on when/how you realize a book has lost you after hooking you, and whether or not you push through it on the basis of the goodwill it earned in the opening.</p>\n\n<p>For me, I&#39;m going to give this book maybe about another hour of reading-time to get me swept up again before I put it down - though I&#39;m definitely going to check out the author&#39;s next works because there was a lot of potential and again, this is just a debut.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
