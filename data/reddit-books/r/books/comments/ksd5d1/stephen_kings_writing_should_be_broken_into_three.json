I've read (almost) every Stephen King novel, novella, short story, and non-fiction under his name - I'm missing the *Gwendy* works, the book about the 2004 Red Sox season, and when he puts out a short story as a part of a multi-author anthology.\n\nWhat I have come across is people voicing their opinion about how \"Classic King\" is better than \"Sober King.\" They can't stand works like *Insomnia*, *Cell*, the Bill Hodges Trilogy, etc. I think it would be easier to think of King's career as smaller careers instead of one big omnibus, which has been done for other artists, usually musicians.\n\nFor example, Aerosmith had a successful career in the '70s - early '80s, and had a separate career starting with their RUN-DMC collaboration remaking \"Walk This Way.\" AC/DC is broken up into the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras by fans. Most of this is done so that fans of the artist can explain what they enjoy more to other fans or newcomers.\n\nEra I - *Carrie* (1974) to *The Dark Half* (1989) - What is largely considered \"Classic\" King, including his releases as Richard Bachman. King was drinking and drugging *hard* through this era. In *On Writing*, he admits that he doesn't remember writing *Cujo*. This is when King was the \"King of Horror\" that marketing professionals the world over will never let us forget.\n\nEra II - *Needful Things* (1991) to *The Dark Tower* (2004) - This is when almost everything King wrote was pulled into The Dark Tower. This is where I think King's least-appreciated works lie. My favourite King novel is *Dolores Claiborne*. There are some stumbles here, too. *Dreamcatcher* doesn't need to be talked about and *Rose Madder*'s antagonist is so one-dimensional that [DoodleBob](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/DoodleBob) could do it better. What is lacking here is King's quality output regarding novellas and short stories. What he put out isn't bad in this time but the limitations and focus on novels hampered his creativity, in my opinion. \n\nEra III - *The Colorado Kid* (2005) to present - After finishing *The Dark Tower*, King had some shaky recovery work (*Cell* isn't his best effort). When the releases began to truly satiate King fans is debatable. For me, *Just After Sunset* and *Full Dark, No Stars* should be thanked for reminding him to exercise all of his creative muscles instead of focusing solely on one set. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for indulging me. I'm curious if you agree with the eras as I've defined them, and what your favourite book/short story collection from each era would be. Or, if you entirely disagree with the concept, I'd like to hear about that, too.",
