Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a romantic person but I just HATE how Austen has framed it where Elizabeth&#39;s mother/ best friend are shallow in their pursuit of security over romance and the only way to mark a &quot;good person&quot; is their determination that &quot;love is greater than money.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It just makes me so furious how Elizabeth is so judgemental of everyone around her who puts their own security over love. Elizabeth&#39;s mother isn&#39;t this vain dimwit she&#39;s made out to be for wanting to make sure her daughters are married off. She&#39;s a mother who doesn&#39;t want to see her daughters thrown out onto the street because that&#39;s what would happen if they don&#39;t marry someone who could support them. That doesn&#39;t make her mother shallow, it makes her a realist.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>edit: I&#39;m not saying you have to agree with me, but downvoting all comments who don&#39;t like the book kind of defeats the purpose of this thread. Book lovers, I&#39;m happy to agree to disagree, but where&#39;s the fun in downvoting all comments that lead to an interesting discussion! :)  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
