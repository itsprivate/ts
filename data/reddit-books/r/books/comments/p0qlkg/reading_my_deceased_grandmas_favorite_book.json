When they announced she didn&#39;t have long to live, I got the idea to buy her favorite book, <em>Tom Sawyer</em>, and try to read it to her. I had never read the book before, but growing up she would always tell me about how her school only had a few books in the library, and one was &quot;Tom Sawyers&quot; as she always called it, and she loved reading it behind the pot-bellied stove in the winter with some popcorn. </p>\n\n<p>I was able to get through the better part of two chapters with her before she passed. The copy I got has a ribbon marker attached and I have it right where we left off so I can eventually finish reading it to her and my grandpa when I&#39;m finally able to make it to their resting place. I have continued on my own, and although I have to take frequent breaks because of how chaotic my mind is with her passing, this book is bringing me so much comfort right now. It&#39;s making me laugh and chuckle, things I wouldn&#39;t otherwise be doing right now. But it&#39;s also helping me feel close to my grandma even despite her passing. I miss her so much, but I feel like I&#39;m keeping her memory alive in some small way as I read this book.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
