I know that she flubs the history or completely makes things up and while it makes me grit my teeth, I can get over it.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously, what I can&#39;t get over is her insane obsession with incest. That&#39;s what makes things bad for me, like wtf is her deal with incest? Let&#39;s take it apart piece by piece:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Other Boleyn Girl: George Boleyn is frequently depicted as intimately kissing both Mary and Anne Boleyn and then it&#39;s heavily, heavily implied that he has sex with Anne, his own sister. </li>\n<li>The Boleyn Inheritance: It is implied that Anne of Cleves brother has a sexual interest in her and likes to see her whipped because he gets sexual pleasure from it. Also, a 16 year old Katherine Howard tries seducing a 60 year old Thomas Howard, her UNCLE.</li>\n<li>The Queen&#39;s Fool: Teenage Elizabeth has a relationship with 40 year old Thomas Seymour, her step-father. I know it doesn&#39;t really count but it infuriates me that PG blames it on Elizabeth being a &quot;whore&quot; and not Seymour, who should be a mature man at 40.</li>\n<li>Constant Princess: Henry VIII is instantly in love with Catherine of Aragon, despite being 10 years old, and the biggest attraction of all is that his brother Arthur had her first.</li>\n<li>The White Queen/Cousin&#39;s War Series: Isabel Neville and George and Anne Neville and Richard III are all first cousins who marry which, while it could be excused, Richard III also has a sexual thing with his niece. Like wtf, the Hapsburgs and their incest are only an ocean away and we know it&#39;s a seriously bad idea when nieces and uncles get together romantically, so PG why would you do this? Are you blind to what happens when uncles-nieces reproduce together?</li>\n<li>Wideacre Trilogy: This one takes the cake for me. You have a brother and a sister having sex and reproducing two kids: a boy and a girl. Then, those two incest kids get together and reproduce again, leading to another daughter.  And nobody has any mental issues despite being the product of 2 generations of brother-sister incest. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t care how hot it is, I cannot get past the close incest. Like, at least 4 books have cases with brother-sister incest. Has PG ever had a sibling? Cause I do and my husband does and most people with sibling&#39;s I talk to could not stand them long enough to form some kind of romantic interest in them. In my experience, nobody gets you to crazy rage faster than a sibling does.</p>\n\n<p>Why is she so interested in incest?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
