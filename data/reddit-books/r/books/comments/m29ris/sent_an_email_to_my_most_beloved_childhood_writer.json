I am so glad to know that my books were meaningful to you, and especially that they provided consolation at moments when you needed it. I think I might need to actually print out your letter and hold onto it for those moments when I am struggling with my writing and questioning if it has a purpose (as all writers do, at some point in every book). I wish you the very best with your own writing, and I wish for you that someday you will receive an email (or many emails, or many of whatever else becomes the normal mode of communication in the future) from readers who feel that *your* work has had a massive impact.\n\nAnd happy upcoming 21st birthday! Take care during this challenging time!\n\nAll best,\n\nMargaret Peterson Haddix\"\n\n\\----\n\nTheir words, these authors', matter so much that 19,000,000 people want to talk about them -- but our words matter too, y'all. Let's never forget it.",
