I have heard about this book for years but never got around to reading it until now and was blown away by how relevant and timely it is to today&#39;s world despite being 25 years old.  </p>\n\n<p>He covers all the logical fallacies of which I have cards of.  He also came to the same conclusion I had come to, once discovering the condition of sleep paralysis, as being the probable explanation for most alien abduction experiences.  Towards the end the book swings more political and makes a very strong case for why the cancel culture (he doesn&#39;t use that term) that we are currently amidst is detrimental to our society&#39;s growth, where he quotes an English philosopher, John Stuart Mills stating that:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;...silencing an opinion is a &#39;peculiar evil.&#39; If an opinion is right, we are robbed of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; and if it is wrong, we are deprived of a deeper understanding of the truth in its collision with error.  If we know only our own side of the argument, we hardly know even that; it becomes stale, soon learned only by rote, untested, a pallid and lifeless truth.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I would highly recommend this to anyone who hasn&#39;t read it.  This just propelled towards the top of my most favorite non-fiction books.  Absolutely amazing. Great read.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Edits for spelling and grammatical clean up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
