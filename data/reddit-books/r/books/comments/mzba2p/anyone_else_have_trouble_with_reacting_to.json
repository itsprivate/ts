I've been chewing on it for a long time and I really want to know if this happens to anyone else and if anyone has advice on how to manage it. \n\nI'm putting this in books because most of the material I react to is written, but its all fiction, written, animated, real person acting with characters in negative situations. I was an avid reader as a child and fictional worlds and characters of all kinds were my escape from a lot of stuff. My life is much better nowadays and I don't use it to escape reality now, just for enjoyment but I feel like I was so intensely engaged with fiction when I was young that my brain just can't help but react as if the people and situations are real, that I've conditioned myself to react this way. \n\nI feel dumb even saying this. I know they're not real. I'm very firmly rooted in reality. But the emotional reaction can be so debilitating it makes me avoid reading/watching something that I know will throw my equilibrium off when I need to focus on studying/working/life in general. I can read something and days later be furious/desperately sad for the character that's suffering. Often I can't get past that part, can't read it at all, end up skipping whole chapters/episodes etc. Some I can't continue with at all. Just this week I've put down a book I was really enjoying because the main character had a bone broken by their boyfriend and their father joked with the guy. Horrible yes, but NOT REAL.\n\nIt's especially weird as I'm not prone to over the top displays of emotion in real life. I do have mild, well managed depression and a severe anxiety disorder, but this too is managed by medication and therapy when I need it. It's probably not helping but I don't think its majorly influencing my feelings. \n\nI hate this. I love fiction and I hate that this gets in the way of me enjoying it. Please tell me I'm not the only one and what you do to overcome it.",
