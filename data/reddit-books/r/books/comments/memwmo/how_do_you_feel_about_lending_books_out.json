But I feel like my reputation as an avid reader has caused some of my friends who are curious about getting into reading to see me as some sort of library, and like a library they don’t return the books for years, or sometimes ever. I often want to re-read books or value them for their edition, or because i’ve had a growing experience with them. Reading requires self discipline that a lot of people don’t maintain, so I am hesitant to lend books out now unless I have a reason to believe the person will return it in due time. Am I the asshole? How do you all feel about this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
