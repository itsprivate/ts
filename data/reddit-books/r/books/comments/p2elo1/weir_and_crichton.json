I&#39;ve been trying to find other authors that scratch that same itch and have mostly fallen short.  A couple of years ago I jumped into Andy Weir&#39;s The Martian and absolutely loved it.  I followed up with Artemis and again, loved it.  I just finished up Project Hail Mary and in my opinion Weir is 3-for-3.  </p>\n\n<p>I come from a science background and thoroughly enjoy the way both Crichton and Weir don&#39;t mind bogging down a bit on the technical side of things.  Sure they take some liberties, but it&#39;s a lot of fun to explore the ideas they present.  After making my way though most of Crichton&#39;s catalogue, I&#39;m really excited to find an author making new work that occupies a similar space.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
