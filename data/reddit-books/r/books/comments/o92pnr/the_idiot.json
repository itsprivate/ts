Someone posted in this sub that they thought the brothers karzmazov was the best book of all time. Naturally, I went out and bought the book, but I also bought the idiot (I wanted to read it as a warm up to the author). Dostoevsky has an ability in creating characters that I’ve never seen any other author have. His characters are emotionally raw. Many of the characters in the book are rich, and the way that they are written feels hilarious, but also completely accurate in context. So much happens in the first part of this book alone, and what was mind blowing to me was that it happened in only one day. My favorite characters are the prince (who I relate to) and nastasya filipovna. The way that nastasya brings out the disbelief, anger, and hilarity of the rest of the cast was a great read. I’m excited to finish the book soon. Do you consider these two characters to be some of fyodor’s best? Who else if not?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
