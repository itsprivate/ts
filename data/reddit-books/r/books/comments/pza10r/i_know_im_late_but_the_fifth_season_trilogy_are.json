I read the same first chapter or two a couple times and just didn’t find anything that grabbed me so would go read something else. Finally I finished a book in the middle of the night while trying to read myself through a bout of insomnia and finally got far enough along for the story and the writing to grab me. That first book had me so obsessed I would think about it all the time and read a little whenever I had a moment to sneak a bit in. I cried more than once and I’ve NEVER cried while reading a book before. I just finished the second book The Obelisk Gate and had to post to this group. \nI’m almost hesitant to start the third book because I don’t want to go through that sadness when you finish a book/series that you’ve loved so much. \nIf you have read this series, do right away. It’s fantastic!!!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
