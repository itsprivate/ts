I read books one through five and enjoyed them with no issues.</p>\n\n<p>Then I joined a book club and read different books with them, which I enjoyed. Then I tried my hand at reading Stormlight 4 and realized how many details I&#39;d forgotten from the first three books. I tried to push through, would Google stuff here and there that I&#39;d forgotten, and by the end of it I had a grasp on everything again I&#39;d say.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m trying Expanse 6 with a similar issue. I needed a refresher on a bunch of details and even some major plot points. I googled some book summaries, which were really long themselves, and I&#39;m currently trying to push through it and hope that I&#39;ll start to make sense of it all again as I continue reading. I&#39;m such a slow reader that I don&#39;t want to take the time to reread the books leading up this again.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, have you ever come across this? How do you handle trying to remember events from previous books? Especially when you&#39;re reading a series and have to wait upwards of years between books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
