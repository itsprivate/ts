Rather, it&#39;s a courtyard with a metal table and lawn chairs adjacent to the cafe, shaded by a bradford pear tree at all times of day. I can sit at the table, drink my house roast and smoke my Marlboro, while watching people stroll by. This time of year, it&#39;s beautifully warm and I enjoy placing the strangers passing by into whatever book I&#39;m reading. Today I finished East of Eden by Steinbeck, and while I was crawling over the final pages, someone was playing Für Elise on the public piano installed in the roped-off section of street for patrons of the surrounded cafes and restaurants. Between the slivers of sunshine penetrating the bradford pear, the sounds of the street, the aroma of coffee and cigarettes, and the pianist, it is the happiest reading spot I&#39;ve discovered in my little corner of the mountains. I&#39;ve thought about painting it. </p>\n\n<p>Have you found a public space that you enjoy reading in almost more than the books you read there? What is it like?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
