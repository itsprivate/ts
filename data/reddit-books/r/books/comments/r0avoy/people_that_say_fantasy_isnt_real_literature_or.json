I&#39;m from Bulgaria, English isn&#39;t my main language so forgive me if I make mistakes.\n I was at work and I saw an opportunity to read. I was reading Malazan Book Of The Fallen by the brilliant Steven Erikson and a colleague came and saw the fat book (Memories Of Ice, book 3 in the series) and first he said &quot;what are you reading, the Bible?&quot; and laughed. Then I showed him the cover and he then asked &quot;Is this some kind of thriller&quot;? (even though the cover clearly shows that it&#39;s not) and I said that it&#39;s fantasy. And he made a disgusted expression with his face and made a body motion as if to shake it off and clean himself of the word &quot;fantasy&quot;. I said nothing and he just went away. But it pissed me off. I&#39;m not saying people should like it, but the amount of disrespect the genre and the amazing authors in it still get is making me angry. Sometimes even people that don&#39;t read books, like at all, make fun of it. They just heard someone else say that fantasy books are not actual books and just repeat it. But their ignorance I can easily forgive. They are just stupid people. I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m ranting, but it&#39;s something that happens constantly. Sometimes, while I was still in school,many years ago, I&#39;ve tried to talk to some people and they pretended to seriously listen to what I had to say about fantasy, but I could see in their eyes that they take it as a joke. And these are people that never read anything in the genre.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
