In somewhat of a way, I began becoming a bit attached. I pictured her with a transatlantic accent almost, or with a Dutch accent when she would speak.</p>\n\n<p>Once I reached the end of the book, I was overcome with emotion. Although I knew of her fate, I closed the book, rested it on my chest and cried. I had forgotten for a minute it was August, and how it’s been 77 years now that she was discovered.</p>\n\n<p>I have always had an interest of Anne Frank, and I’m thankful to have read the real, definitive edition of her writings.</p>\n\n<p>☹️♥️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
