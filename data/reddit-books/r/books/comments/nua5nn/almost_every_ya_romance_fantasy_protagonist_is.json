It&#39;s always &quot;I don&#39;t belong here&quot;, &quot;everyone hates me&quot; or &quot;I hate everyone and everything&quot;. They think they are less worth than like idk the nobles or whatever but still ALWAYS THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. I don&#39;t know if they actually say that directly but that&#39;s surely the vibe I&#39;m ALWAYS getting and it&#39;s so annoying. Like I get it you don&#39;t like dresses, and makeup and whatever THIS DOESNT MAKE YOU BETTER?! And reading this over and over again in different books when the only difference between all those girls is maybe their  name it gets so boring after a while. \nSorry for my english but I really had to rant rn. 😔</p>\n\n<p>if you know any romance fantasy books that have a more interesting protagonist I&#39;d be SO THANKFUL!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
