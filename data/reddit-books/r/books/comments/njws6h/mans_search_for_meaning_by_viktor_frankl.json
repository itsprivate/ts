I loved how he emphasized on what kept him going despite his circumstances. How he didn't go delirious like most of the other prisoners. He says this beautiful quote \"I dread not being worthy of my suffering\". The book talks about how you should rise above your circumstances and how despite the same one always has spiritual freedom where he can find his solace in. And, I love how he said just proving to be useful does not give meaning to your life and how people these days only like successful,young and happy people. I love how he also said old people shouldn't be pitied . You can find meaning in loving someone and other ways which help you be beyond yourself.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.",
