Iâ€™m looking to find that feeling again of being really invested in a book so I turn to it instead of my phone when I have downtime. Some things I like (generally) \n- strong female leads \n- tame romance like room with a view \n- fantasy thatâ€™s not too heavy (think like the show gravity falls) \n- fairies, gnomes, sylvan spirits, etc \n- I love Japanese books \n- I loved lord of the rings, mainly for the cuteness of it (little dwarves going to pubs and finding ponies) \n- books about being alone in an empowering way (think Wild by Cheryl strayed) \n- outdoor adventure (like Jon krakauer books) </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance ðŸ’—</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
