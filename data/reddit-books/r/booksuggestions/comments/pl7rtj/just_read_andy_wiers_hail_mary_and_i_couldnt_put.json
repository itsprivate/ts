I loved the central characters and their flow to the dialogue. Just all around an extremely enjoyable reading experience.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;d like to find if anyone here can help me is investigative books with fast pacing with maybe some elements of sci fi and fantasy within them. I want something that is written well but doesn&#39;t forget how the experience is supposed to be fun. Maybe this is too specific, but I really enjoy reading experiences littered with discovery that doesn&#39;t come at a cost of great character work and themes.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Weir not Wier, sorry about that! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
