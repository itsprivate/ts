I hope it’s ok that I’m sharing here—I just feel like it would be great to have some members from the community join in! It’s going to be largely self-paced, and very low pressure (much like our happy group here). Our August pick is “Toil and Trouble” by Augusten Burroughs. Check it out on instagram and twitter @ GrimoireBookClub, or at grimoirebookclub.com and sign up for the newsletter! Hope to see you there 💕 🔮✨📖</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
