I&#39;ve read most of Jane Austen&#39;s works and I think them absolutely brilliant (what a surprise, I know :D), so I&#39;ve been looking for something similar. One of my favourite things about Jane Austen is that her books are undeniably romance novels, but still, they are not sex-obsessed. Austen remarks on the appearance of pretty much everybody, but they are aesthetic or factual remarks, not horny/overwhelmed with sexual attraction ones. I&#39;m tired of horny people, and I am tired of reading about horny people. I have tried writers like Georgette Heyer and Julia Quinn but they did not quite hit the mark. But, I am definitely ready to try them again since I haven&#39;t read all of their books (or gotten past the first few chapters) and there might be some of them which fit the bill. I&#39;ve also checked out quite a few of goodreads/similiar recommended book lists, but most/all of the book covers have half-naked people, or the blurb/reviews have things like &quot;instant sexual attraction&quot; or &quot;a scandalous night led to...&quot;, which uh, hasn&#39;t convinced me to try those books out. </p>\n\n<p>To sum up- set in the regency era, main focus is romance/romance is a very important factor in the story, there is no sex, there are no characters being overwhelmed with sexual attraction, characters do not constantly think about sex/have sex dreams/hump pillows while smelling handkerchiefs that the other gave them, there are no heaving bosoms or straining breeches, no one is unbearably horny, sex is not a component of romance. Preferably no sexual tension at all, but I&#39;m fine with tasteful sexual tension, for example &quot;his hand clasped hers during the dance, and while she had danced a hundred such dances in her life, and had had her hand clasped a hundred times, it was different with Mr. Such-and-such&quot; and that&#39;s it, that&#39;s where it stops. It does not continue with a heaving bosom. Wow this ended up the longest summary ever. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; regency era romance, no sex, no one is horny!!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
