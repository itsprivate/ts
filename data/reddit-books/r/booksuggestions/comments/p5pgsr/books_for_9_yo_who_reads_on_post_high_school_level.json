Since last year during the COVID-19 lockdown, she’s been devouring books faster than we can provide. However, now that she’s returning to school, she took one of those standardized placement tests. On the English reading and comprehension category, she scored on a post-high school level! I wasn’t sure how much I believed that when I had heard it, but after talking with her more lately I can definitely see it now. Unsurprisingly, she’s become frustrated with the books recommended to her age level. She’s even started writing her own short stories to make her own books. She’s already read most of the literary classics, and we’re already looking at getting her the Harry Potter books and the Chronicles of Narnia. </p>\n\n<p>So, what books can be recommended to a 9 y/o girl who reads on a post-high school level, while still keeping subject matters appropriate? </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any suggestions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
