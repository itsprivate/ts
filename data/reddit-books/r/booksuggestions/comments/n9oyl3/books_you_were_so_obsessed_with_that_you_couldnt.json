Read A LOT of Enid Blyton and went on to read Harry Potter and a lot of YA fiction , you know the whole hunger games , divergent , Percy Jackson stuff in middle school and a little into high school and I totally loved them all.  I read a bit in high school too , some of John Green , Murakami etc  Liked some of it but nothing to the point I would call an obsession like the Enid Blyton , Harry Potter and  YA fiction times . I read less and less frequently. Would never say I left reading Exactly but I was reading very less and didn&#39;t enjoy what I read. \nI just thought that I&#39;d lost my love for reading . Maybe all these shows and series were my way of entertainment now. Reading probably wasn&#39;t for me and I just kept trying to pursue it due to nostalgia but oh boy was I wrong . Recently picked up The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I was HOOKED. Finished it in one day not because I didn&#39;t have anything else to do but because I couldn&#39;t do anything else\nSo this is what I want. The kind of obsession where you can&#39;t put it down. You have to but you can&#39;t. You have a book hangover for days after . You feel bad you can&#39;t ever read it for the first time ever again. You HAVE to tell everyone about it but not many of your friends read. You want more and more of this world you can&#39;t have enough\nSo I want such books. Books you couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t put down. Books you were obsessed with. Please suggest !!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
