So I guess Im asking you all more experienced readers for some advice. I know Im looking for some good fantasy though, preferably High fantasy though I did enjoy Twilight (I know)....</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>To give a little context Ive always loved the standard fantasy in video games(Warhammer, Warcraft), Though Eragon wasnt a super good story plot wise, it had enough magic, cuteness and romance to keep me going. So I guess I got a weakness for the whole Fantasy action/romance. Ive also covered some Norse gods books in Norwegian. And Tolkien is Tolkien. :D However Ive had little success outside of this.</p>\n\n<p>Game of Thrones was ok, a little too slow paced, but Tyrion and a few other charas made it worth.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Books Ive disliked so far: Maze runner, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Been looking myself for awhile with little success, so would be awesome to get some from someone a little familiar with books in the genre.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
