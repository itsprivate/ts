She is also forced to stay at home during the holidays and look after this sibling, which I think she resents. She reads well above her age (18+ usually) and is very intelligent. She loves fantasy books, but I would love something that addresses the theme of being the least favoured in life (in whatever context) with the goal of bringing comfort.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that makes some sense</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
