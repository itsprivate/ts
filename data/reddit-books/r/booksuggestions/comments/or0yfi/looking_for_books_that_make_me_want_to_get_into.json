As a kid I would ask my librarian every day if a new magic treehouse book came in if I knew one had been released. When I was a little older I got into the 39 Clues series and read all 10 of the first set. Book 1 was the first book I ever read in a day and I think the into one I read a second time. Later I really liked Ted Dekker’s books Saint &amp; Showdown, The Circle Series, and The Lost Books. I don’t know why I stopped reading but the last book I tried reading was Harry Potter and I had a hard time getting through the 1st book and never finished the 2nd. Really I’m just looking for suggestions that would be like the ones I used to read as a kid but would also like now that I’m 24. I figured there wouldn’t be a better place to ask.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
