Most recent discussion is the Harry & Meghan interview, and I find it very difficult to argue my point without getting heated because I can’t believe my Dad’s side of it. I find this then cheapens my argument and I can’t think as clearly. I’m just finding it a bit harder lately, not sure why. \n\nI want to learn how to keep my cool and be understanding and respectful of the opposite opinion even if I disagree with it strongly. I know my dad cherishes these ‘arguments’ as we usually get a good debate going, and it is quality time we have together. I want to make sure they are respectful and productive. Are there any books to help with this?\n\nThanks everyone!",
