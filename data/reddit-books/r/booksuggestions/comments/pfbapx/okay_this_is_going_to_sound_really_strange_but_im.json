I know it my sounds crazy but if you look up on google images &quot;cottagecore aesthetic&quot; different pictures will pop up with plants, tea cups, nice country houses and stuff like that. The only thing closest to these things are basically the chapters in The Lord of The Rings that revolves around The Shire and even some Elves places. I don&#39;t know if the question is clear or not but I&#39;m looking for books with these atmospheres, calming and relaxing books I guess, but with this kind of setting. Since english is not my first language I&#39;ll understeand if I didn&#39;t explain myself properly so I&#39;ll try to be as clear as possible answering you if you&#39;ll ask for any more clarification.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
