It could be anything like waking up an older dangerous civilization, signaling some distant powerful alien races or maybe the artifacts themselves are enough threat in some mysterious ways that humans do not realize yet. Anything and everything will work for me.\nMy favourite scenario(not necessary for recommendations): humans have colonized a few star systems or at least our solar system in pretty much distant future and are highly-advanced civilization by our standard and then they find artifacts on some planets. Maybe some politics and power curves. Some psychos trying to gain dominance over by using this long lost newly found technology and then they piss off something really dangerous.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
