  "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nA couple of months ago we posted about a project me and a friend were working on, called librimood (librimood.com). It is an AI powered search engine for finding books based on your mood. For example you can search abstract queries like “a book that will make me cry” or “a book with a strong female lead” and get relative results! We got a very positive feedback from the community and we decided to keep working on it and improving it. Since then we have added the following features:\n\n\n- More books\n\n- Improved search results\n\n- Fiction / Non-fiction filtering\n\n- New mode: **Contextual Recommendations**. Get similar themed books for your favorite book. (click on the icon on the left of the search bar. It will switch recommendation mode, indicated by the blue color. You can then search your favorite title and get some recommendations back!)\n\n- Feedback mechanism . Help us improve the results by scrolling to the bottom of the results page and suggesting books that you would expect to see based on the query that you typed.\n\n\nWe would love for you to try it out and tell us what you think, and where we should focus on next!",
