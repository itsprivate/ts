She loved books and the two years she spent fighting cancer, we read to her every night. After months of grieving, my husband and I decided to continue the the tradition, and now we read a chapter or two together every night. Serena would have turned 7 on 21st October and to honour her we wanted to read something that reflects our experiences. </p>\n\n<p>So please recommend books about families dealing with children getting diagnosed with chronic illnesses and/or passing away from it.\nSomething which realistically depicts the feeling of sheer helplessness when you see your child dying in front of you. Even a book where a protagonist deals with the trauma of losing an adult son/daughter will do. </p>\n\n<p>No self help/ advice books please. Preferably fiction, but non fiction will also do as long as it doesn&#39;t get too preachy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
