Because of that I&#39;m basically open to all sorts of recommendations from finding purpose in life, to how to share your emotions with people. The only thing that I wouldn&#39;t enjoy is something along the lines of &quot; Think and grow rich&quot; by Napoleon Hill, since that just felt a bit too brain-washy for me personally.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: I guess self help books for a young guy lost in life?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
