Don’t get me wrong, YA/teen books are great it’s just that I’d like to relate to a character more of my age and that’s going through more of what I’m going through as an adult now. I really like fantasy/sci-fi fiction and I’m big fan of the Percy Jackson series and comic books in general. Every time I ask in a bookstore, I’m always told that there’s nothing wrong with reading YA and that adult books like what I’m looking for don’t really exist. :/</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all for commenting and validating me in my search for these books! I’m super excited to get my reading train going again 😁</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
