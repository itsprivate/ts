I read the FIRST CHAPTER of 4 of the books, and I&#39;ve already decided on getting &quot;A Fault In Our Stars&quot; but I&#39;m not very sure about the other three:-</p>\n\n<p>Turtles All The Way Down</p>\n\n<p>Looking For Alaska</p>\n\n<p>Paper Towns</p>\n\n<p>Turtles feels very personal. I feel like I&#39;m really gonna see this character go through her mental issues in great detail and get very attached to her, She&#39;s probably my favourite character so far from the first chapters. I also deal with mental illness so maybe that would appeal to me, I don&#39;t mind if the books feels sad.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think I read Alaska&#39;s first chapter, Amazon showed a different one, one where the narrator and alaska were laying down and talking while she was smoking. I really liked this part and the deep questions and topics they were discussing. I found it very charming and I&#39;d love to see the relationship between these two develop.</p>\n\n<p>Paper towns was really cool, the first chapter was so much fun and really interesting, talking about the guy who died and the girl being so intrigued by it and doing an investigation then coming back to tell Q. The book reminds me of &quot;I Am Not Okay With This&quot; in that I felt really comfortable if that makes sense, like a safe space, but I wonder how the story will go after the girl dissappears, and the story takes a big turn from what I read in the first chapter, will it still be interesting to me?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear what you thought about the story and why (without really spoiling) and also how you think I&#39;ll feel about it based on how I feel so far. Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
