Can you suggest some must-reads to get me started?\n\nP.S, I working through Game of Thrones right now which is great but also very detailed and dense. Maybe a couple lighter books to read in between those would be nice. George R. R. Martin needs to relax, the one I just finished had a 40 page long appendix XD\nSorry for the long post.",
