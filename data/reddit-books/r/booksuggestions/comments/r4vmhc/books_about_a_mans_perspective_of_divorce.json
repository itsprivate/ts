I love her very much and accepted the differences between us but she doesn&#39;t love me anymore, and is no longer happy, so we&#39;re splitting up. I&#39;ve moved out already. The whole thing is very sad for me but we are still friends and there&#39;s no resentment or blame or anything like that. This is the friendliest and most gentle break up/divorce that I&#39;ve ever heard of. There&#39;s nothing that can be changed to make our relationship work, we&#39;re simply just different people with different priorities. But my heart is broken and I was just wondering if you lot could suggest any good novels that are somehow relevant to my situation at all?</p>\n\n<p>I want to heal, and move on with my life. Maybe reading a relatable story and having a big cry will help.</p>\n\n<p>I would prefer suggestions of novels, not self care/self help type books. I&#39;m already quite well connected to myself and I&#39;ve done a lot of healing over the years, but this divorce just blindsided me, so I want fictional stories of men in a similar situation...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the suggestions and kind words, it&#39;s much appreciated!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
