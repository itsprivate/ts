Thing is, I'm really not wanting to support Jeff Bezos. He's filthy rich, and I'd rather not make him richer, especially given how selfish he's known to be with his wealth.  \n\n\nI've heard of Kobo, it functions much the same as Audible, however unfortunately their range of books seems to be doo-doo. Is there any other sites that people have used that are really good?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I’m in Australia guys so unfortunately Libro.fm won’t work for me, but I LOVE that movement! I downloaded Libby and my local libraries have audiobooks for days on there. Thanks so much guys!",
