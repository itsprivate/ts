She's been working hard on zoom for the past year (unable to retire due to finances) and I really wish she could catch a break!\n\nOne thing that's been getting her through all this is Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series on Audiobook, as expertly narrated by Davina Porter, but she's listened to it twice now and is looking for something new !\n\nShe says the Outlander series is a good mix of historical tidbits and intrigue, but also something you can semi tune out of here and there (not too dense or requiring a huge amount of focus). Honestly, to hear her tell it, it's been one of the very few things that has brought her real comfort during the pandemic.\n\nI think her admiration for Davina Porter is on the same level of her appreciation for the author's writing! She even said she listened to some biography of Elizabeth I that Porter narrated, just to give you an idea.\n\nShe's also indicated a (variable) fondness for Isabel Allende; she liked House of Spirits and Island Beneath The Sea, but expressed an indifference towards some of her other works (which I wish I could remember, gah. I think she said A Long Petal Of The Sea didn't really grab her ?)\n\nI'm basically looking for audiobook recommendations of similar works (or works read by Davina Porter), hopefully available thru libby.\n\nThanks so much all ;_;",
