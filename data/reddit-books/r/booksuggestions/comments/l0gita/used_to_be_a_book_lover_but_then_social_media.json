But, I came across this sub Reddit and I thought to myself, give it a try, it might be helpful. \n\nSo here goes nothing.\n\nWhen I was little, I grew up reading books. My parents read to me before bedtime and eventually, when I could, I read stories before sleeping myself. And in high school, we had to have a book with us every day. They didn't want us to daydream and do nothing in between classes, if you were finished with your assignments you were supposed to read your book.  \n\nTo top it off, we had to report how far along we were! If you had a new book because you finished your old one, that had to be reported as well. So naturally, I was trying to be the fastest reader in the class. So I managed to read whole books in one month. My parents were proud, teachers were proud and I was proud of myself too! I was so amazed by how my imagination worked when reading those books. I imagined being a character too. Those were really fun times.\n\nBut then in junior year, I lost interest, and all of a sudden a lot of classmates were talking about this new app and how fun it was. They all encouraged me to join them. Some of them said that I shouldn't be such a bookworm. That's when I kind of didn't want to read anymore. I was afraid that they would bully me. After school everyone was online and chatting and playing games with each other, I didn't want to be the odd duck. At that time I refused to touch another book again. \n\nHowever, a few years later I found Wattpad! So that piqued my interest and I started reading again. Of course, it’s not the same as reading a real book. But I was happy that I was reading again. It had is down side though, because I was so used to reading from a small screen I got too lazy to read an actual book. And that’s such a shame honestly. I know that there is no better feeling than feeling the paper on your fingertips. Alas, even Wattpad wasn’t that interesting to me anymore, so I hardly read anything on there anymore. \n\nI am dying to find a good book to read again. I really want to pick up my old hobby again and I want to get lost in the story and let my imagination go wild. \n\nTo summarise, I used to love reading and I read a lot. I basically devoured books. But then fear took over and I was afraid I was going to get bullied for being a “bookworm” and that’s when I stopped reading. So can somebody help a sis out and recommend me an easy book to begin with?\n\nThanks a lot!",
