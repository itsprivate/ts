Kind of along the lines of PG-13 sex can happen but I just don’t want a huge explicit detailed account of sexy bits because I tend to read while on the go and it creeps me out reading full on erotica in public lol). I really like warm fuzzy romances where it ends well (but it doesn’t necessarily need to seem like it will end well along the way) and where the romance isn’t out of place. I don’t like it when the characters can’t be together because they’re gay - it bums me out. I’ve found a few lgbt novels I like with this lack of homophobia/being gay being super noteworthy it’s just something that’s there (In Deeper Waters, House In The Cerulean Sea) but they’re both gay men books. Hoping to find something like these but lesbian/wlw (idc if they’re really lesbians or bi or pan or whatever just a wlw relationship). </p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t need to be a fantasy</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
