I was a voracious reader as a child but eventually I kinda lost the motivation to read despite wanting to. I recently sought mental health treatment and talked with my psychiatrist about the above mentioned problem. They advised me to restart the reading habit slowly, with light, easy going books. They assured me that with improvement with mental health I&#39;ll find the lost reader in me again. I&#39;ll be grateful if you guys can help me by suggesting books which are easy on the mind. Thank you in advance!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
