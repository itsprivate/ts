But I noticed that most of the books there were, frankly, really bad. Just from skimming through them it was clear the writing wasn’t very mature and the characters were cliche and undeveloped with very cartoonish lines of dialogue. But worst of all, all of them had the exact same dynamic: the men were territorial, powerful doms, and the women were stunningly gorgeous subs. </p>\n\n<p>So I actually hate that kind of dynamic. I’m into extremely gentle fem dom, where the woman takes the lead and is nurturing to the male. My book doesn’t have to emulate that though! But I just want to clarify I’m not really into the cliche thing where the man is in total control. </p>\n\n<p>I guess what I’m looking for is something with authenticity, intimacy, complexity, and vulnerability. The dynamic shows partners who are equal to each other and are crazy about one another. The characters have some personality. The sex is realistic and intimate. Things like that!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
