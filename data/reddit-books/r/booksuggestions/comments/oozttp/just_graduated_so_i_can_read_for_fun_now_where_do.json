I’ve had my eye on Iain Dale’s The Prime Ministers, so non-fiction is on the table. \nI also like the idea of learning more generally, economics, new history, maybe even this mindfulness and habit stuff I’ve been hearing about. \nI’m just a slow reader and big books are daunting, so I’d like to ease into it before I got tackling volumes again. \nSorry if this is a bit vague and broad, I look forward to your suggestions :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
