I am interested in advice/strategies to make the best use of this money for the long run. I plan to invest the vast majority of it into Index funds but am looking for help in regards to which funds and what ratios would fit my specific position. A rough   breakdown of what I've been told to expect is below:\n\n* \\~250k in cash. This will come over time in fractions as accounts/assets are liquidated.\n* \\~250k  in the form of two separate Inherited IRAs (one in Vanguard, one in TD  Ameritrade). I do not yet know how these are allocated in regards to  Traditional or Roth.\n\nSome   background: I am engaged (and have told my fiance about the windfall)   to be married October 2022. We are both 30 and government employees   making \\~100k each (with expectation of each of our salaries to increase   to \\~125k over the next 10 years). Upon knowledge of the windfall, we   immediately altered our TSP contributions for this year to max out the   $19,500 limit by the end of the year (I did the math to ensure we don't   miss out on the government match) and intend to max our TSP   contributions going forward. We just purchased a house (\\~380k left on   mortgage @ 2.75%). Fiance has student loans totaling \\~100k, however she   is 6 years into the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.\n\nI've   done research on Inherited IRAs and understand that I will have 10   years to withdraw this money. I understand that I will want to choose   how much to withdraw per calendar year to avoid bumping ourselves into   another tax bracket. We plan to file separately until her student loans  are forgiven via PSLF. \n\n* What   should I do with the new found cash and withdrawals from the Inherited   IRAs? I know enough to say I want to invest it into Vanguard Index  funds  but I am looking for advice into the specifics of this as a  beginner (specific funds, ratios, etc.). Is it wise for us to  split/diversify our windfall  outside of throwing it into Index funds  (open another IRA?, switch our health insurance to utilize an HSA?,  etc.).\n\nI  recognize this  is significant amount of money that could set us up  incredibly well in  the future and I would like to make sure it is  properly managed and  invested. While I recognize we are lucky and will be set up very well,  I'm wondering exactly how well setup we can expect to be (if we chose to  retire early, how early is realistic and what we need to do to get  there?). Any and all additional advice is welcome.  I can add any  clarifying information as needed. Thanks in advance  everyone.",
