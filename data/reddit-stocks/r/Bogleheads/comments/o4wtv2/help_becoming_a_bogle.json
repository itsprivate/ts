For the past few months I’ve been adding to VOO, VXUS, and BND. \n\nI see a lot of people selling their whole portfolio in order to jump into the Bogle deep end. Given that I don’t need the money (other than to maybe reinvest it), and most of those companies are probably not bad to hold for years, and the few riskier ones may still pay off in the future, **do you think I (or most people) should sell all the individual stocks, or is it reasonable to just be more Bogle-minded going forward and only invest in the proper ETFs while just holding/ignoring the individual stocks I already own?**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on VOO, VXUS, BND? If starting from scratch maybe I’d do VTI instead of VOO, but given that I already have a nice amount of VOO, is it best to just stick with that?\n\nThanks!",
