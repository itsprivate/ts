Starting to think about doing a cash out refi and investing in a mix of vtsax/vtiax and maybe 10% in bonds for a couple years in case the market tanks a lot. Ik statistically this isnt the smartest play but would help me sleep at night knowing i could buy the dip if we had a huge drop. I would eventually invest it.\n\nStatistically my money will double every 7 years assuming a 10% return which ik is being generous but I will still be contributing along the way so if its lower i will make up for it. This means my money will double 5 times which when I do the math after adding what is already invested comes out to a very large number. Although im putting a lot into invesments right now due to the increased cashflow, I feel like putting the 250-300k in the market now while im young would be huge for me later on in life\n\nObv i would have a mortgage but Im figuring if sh*t hits the fan i can always downsize or rent to make sure i dont touch my investments..\n\nI absolutely LOVE having a paid for house and living a debt free lifestyle. This is very tempting the more i think about it though…\nThoughts?",
