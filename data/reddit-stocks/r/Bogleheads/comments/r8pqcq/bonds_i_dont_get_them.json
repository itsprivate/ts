  "selftext": "TLDR: Considering increasing bond holdings but wondering about 1. How bonds are expected to perform right now, 2. Rebalancing and selling of bonds and, 3. Does this all just come down to your emotional tolerance?\n\nBackground information: Upper 30’s y/o M, married, total in tax-advantaged accounts of ~130,000.  Hoping for at least semi-retirement around age 60 with possible 1-1.2mm. We are very aggressive (for us) with our monthly contributions which total about 2.4k. \n\n\nWe currently both have 401k’s with target date funds (about 83% of our total $) and both have IRA’s which are only equity holdings with the other 17% of the total $. This translates to roughly 8% of the 130,000 in bonds.\n\n\nSo with the above considered, I am looking at our equity to bond ratio with intentions to increase bonds to perhaps 15-20% of our total holdings.  But I have a few questions about bonds:\n\n\n1.  “Timing for bonds is currently poor”.  I don’t really identify with this, as I do not wish to try to time the market.  But, if I’m understanding correctly that bond yield is inversely related to interest rates, and we know through the Fed that interest rates will rise, is this as simple as saying “because interest rise is a given, reduced bond yield is also a given”?  If that’s the case, just the possibility of a continued positive return in equities would seem to outperform any bond option?  (I suspect the above is either inaccurate, or at least only partial truth, but I don’t know how/why).\n\n\n2.  “I like bonds because I can use them to rebalance in a downturn”.  So this is a common thing I’ve seen and it’s the argument that holding bonds is beneficial because when equities tank, you can sell your bonds to “buy equities low”, “buy when stocks are on sale” etc.  I personally don’t identify with this as I feel this is a red flag for trying to time the market.  \n\n\nBut, is there an argument for doing this the “right way”; if you have a chosen date, say either quarterly, or the same date once each year where you rebalance, this would be ideal right?  It takes away the emotion and removes the attempt at timing the market? \n\n\n3.  Finally, I wanted to ask about what seems like the main two arguments about bonds: first, the emotional side and secondly the purely financial side. It seems like discussions here often cite someone’s emotional wherewithal as a factor for bonds and that makes sense to me. I like to think I can stay the course with my above allocation at my current age, but I’m not so worried about seeing my portfolio tank by 50%, I’m worried about seeing it bleed to that number over the course of about 5 years, and another 5 years for it to come back to the same number, for a flat return over 10 years. \n\n\n\tBut on the financial side; assuming the above wasn’t an issue for me and I just blindly kept the same monthly contributions but with my current ~8% bond allocation.  Obviously it depends on when the stop date is, but there’s an argument for someone finishing with a better return if they’re able to stay the course on the more aggressive allocation, correct?\n\n\n\nThank you for any insight!",
