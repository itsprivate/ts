What I really would like to know from people around this sub is if you all really feel it’s worth it to have other ETFs besides VTI. Other than QQQ I have SCHD and XLF (XLF getting sold soon) as well. I started in February and I can see there definitely is a difference in returns between QQQ and VTI(and VUG as well). For everyone else, do you have any other reasons as to holding VUG (or any other holding) other than the chance of a higher return? Diversification seems out of the equation. What negative things would you say about owning other ETFs when you already own VTI? In a way, don’t you get more exposure to the market having VTI and other ETFs that have at least just 15% or more holdings invested that VTI doesn’t also have?",
