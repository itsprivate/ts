Nevertheless I would like to keep my American citizenship.\n\nI've spent the past few months reading up a lot about investing and discovered this subreddit, which seems like exactly what I want. As you all probably know there are a bunch of hurdles to investing as a German-American living anywhere outside of the US. I can't buy US-domiciled ETFs from almost any European brokerage account and I can't buy EU-domiciled ETFs because of PRIIPS.\n\nNow I know a few people, who just pretend that they are still living in the States and open an account in a brokerage of their choice. I tried this with Fidelity and was denied even though I used a VPN to make it seem like I was in the States. Are there any brokerages, where this strategy would work? I would use my uncle's address, so mail wouldn't be an issue.\n\nI also go to the States every year to visit my family, so I was thinking I could open an account in person because they might not check as much. Is this a viable alternative strategy?\nAnd if it is, which brokerage has a place you can go to in person? I know that Fidelity is completely online.\n\nThanks in advance for any and all help:)",
