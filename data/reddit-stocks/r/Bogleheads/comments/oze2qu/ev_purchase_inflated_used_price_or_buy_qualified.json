My typical mantra is to never buy anything newer than 3 years old, and buy an efficient well-running beater I don’t care about so I can keep insurance and stress low, and drive it until it dies. I’ve done this to great success for 10+ years. For a while, I’ve been saving $400+/mo in a separate savings account for an eventual car purchase. I will be purchasing my next car either all in cash, or with around 20k down.\n\nMy next car is going to be electric for a whole host of reasons. My Boglehead question is — With how inflated used car prices are right now, would it make more sense to buy a *new* EV that qualifies for the $7,500 federal rebate, so long as purchase price is under $37,500? (20% depreciation in first year, $7,500 is 20% of $37,500. First year’s depreciation covered by the government). And this way I’d still get the financial benefit of a full warranty and in some manufacturer’s cases, included maintenance for x # of years.\n\nThoughts?",
