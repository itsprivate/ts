  "selftext": "Hello\n\nHoping to start a discussion on wether or not countries like China should be included in VT when the market and companies are not subject to normal market forces but the communist party.\n\nYes, one could argue that EM is only 10% od VT and China is only 35% of EM but what if it was not? Would it still be a good idea to include a country where trillions can disappear just because one person in the party has a crazy idea?\n\nEven before this year China was seen as a risky investment because westerners were not allowed to buy real shares of a company but only shells of a holding.\n\nThis year China started pushing against big tech heavily:\n\n- Many Chinese tech stocks are down between 40 - 60% YTD because of government restrictions\n\n- Today Peking declared that IPOs of Chinese companies through offshore holdings will be forbidden in future\n\n- Many Chinese companies could face delisting in the US if they dont comply with financial inspection until 2024\n\n- With the new opening of the  Beijing stock exchange China will target a delisting of Chinese companies in the US to list them there\n\n- The transportation company DiDi is already forced to provide plans, to prepare for a delisting in the US. Similiar fate could hit Alibaba and other Chinese companies as China is actively pursuing these delistings\n\n\nYes, we could say market cap is market cap and with how small china is we could care less but what if it wasnt China but the USA doing these things with their 60% cap?  How could we be invested in companies where the government could just take away our stock ownership because they want?\n\n\nEdit: Spelling",
