My advisor put $60,000 in at once(around a month ago) and left the remaining $40,000 to be invested sometime later. So far I’m down around 3%, and was curious if now would be a good time to invest the rest of the money, or if I should wait some more. Or, would it be better to invest only part of the $40,000 in now, and keep some cash to invest sometime later, or should I just lump sum the remaining $40,000? Thank you all for any help.",
