I'm employed at ~$90k/yr, wife is not atm but brings home ~1400/mo tax free VA disability. No debt, currently renting.\n\nI currently have about $125k in a target fund 401k to which I contribute 20%, including a 6% company match. I also have a Fidelity account with about $35k in a rollover IRA(randomly chose FSCSX first, then moved about 85% to VOO), $8k in a former employer 401a and then recently opened an individual account to start trying to save more, smarter. I'll have to look at the wife's, she only has a small 403b and an old mutual fund with $30-40k that's probably being eaten up with fees. $20k in emergency savings. \n\nMy main question first, is if I should be doing something better with ~$90k in the short-term instead of a MMSA at 0.45%?  This is equity money we are saving for a down-payment but given the market and potential life changes, I think we're gonna wait at least another year maybe more before we buy again. It's been sitting there for a year and a half and I feel like I should be getting something more than the $33/mo returns. 😥 But I understand a high risk approach is not suitable here. I could see it being 2 maybe 3 years now before we make any big decisions and may need it.\n\nWe've also been contributing $1k per month to the down payment fund which can continue or be modified to go elsewhere.\n\nI'm ignorant on pretty much all of this, but interested to start getting things on better track in order to better prepare for our future. Any advice on what to do with that cash for now while I educate myself on the rest of my mess? Thanks guys and gals.\n\nMike\nColorado, USA",
