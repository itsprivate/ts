I still remember March 13 2020 like it was yesterday. That is the day in Virginia that schools were shuttered and COVID impacted our daily life. In those early months I took a force break from work due to lack of customers, and enjoyed time with the kids at home and learning to enjoy taking the time to \"smell the flowers\". Sure there was a lot of angst about how this would impact our finances and future. But also a time to \"recalibrate\" and make smart decisions.\n\nAs far as for financial planning 2020 was the year we got serious as a family. COVID forced us to look at budgeting hard. We had just spent a lot of money with backyard/house renovations and our plan to pay back the debt was curtailed. I also got serious with retirement planning - am about 10 years away. Voraciously read as much as I could over the past year, joined multiple forums including r/financialplanning, r/bogleheads, r/personalfinance, r/investing, r/stocks, r/retirement, r/whitecoatinvestors, and r/WSB. I've since left some. I put together our savings plan and goals, and calculated we will be more than OK to retire comfortable in 10 years. I also got all my kids interested in retirement planning in their 20's and all have a copy of Berstein's \"If You Can\" paper to millennials, and a copy of A Simple Path To Wealth. Helped my 18 yo with his first Roth IRA account. Finally got around to getting an umbrella insurance policy. And updated our family \"financial bible\" and convinced my dad to do the same. The \"financial bible' is a binder with copies of all the important documents an estate executor may need if something happened to me and the wife. Copies of 401K statements, beneficiary statements (to bypass probate), brokerage and bank statements, real estate records, copy of all utility and credit card statements, and copies of all like insurance policies.\n\nI did become a Boglehead during this time thanks to JL Collins, Bogle's The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, this this reddit community. I am so thankful for the knowledge shared here. I also went thru the 5 stages of acceptance to becoming a Boglehead and changed my 401K out of the target date fund and into an equivalent 3 fund portfolio (it took me 5 funds to approximate VTSAX, VTIAX and VBTLX, but I did cut my expense ratio from almost 0.53 to 0.11).\n\nSo as I look back, 2020 let me put my life back into order, and learn to value time with family much more. The younger kids at home are growing so fast. Since COVID vaccines, we are able to spend much more quality time together with my parents who are in their 80's. I have much less worries about my retirement plans - financially we will be fine, and the COVID sabbaticals have shown me I have plenty of interests to keep me busy in retirement.
