However I still have a few questions:\n\n### A) Brokerage Account:\n\nIn this day and age, most brokerage offer free trades. If one is going to simply buy some Vanguard ETFs (VTI, BND and VXUS), what would be wrong with just using the brokerage service associated with my bank (e.g. BoA or Wells Fargo)?\n\nWhat would be the main downside?

Once again, if one uses a national bank such as BoA, Chase etc... is it really necessary? If yes, should I just ask a banker to open 10 accounts if you want to store $2.5M in cash?\n\n### C) None taxable accounts\n\nBy now, I won't be able to make any contributions to IRA or 401K accounts... the common advise on BogleHeads is to put all the bonds in there (BND) to avoid paying short term capital gain. Putting aside the potential change of treatment of long term capital gain, does it really matter now?\n\nShould I just move all the non-taxable stuff (about $200K) to BND none the less? or is this a red herring?\n\n### D) Do I need a Financial Advisor?\n\nI just have a very hard time giving away 1% or even 0.5% for what appears to be nothing. But given the size of the windfall, do I need someone? It feels like the only thing worthy would be paying an estate and/or tax attorney (with fiduciary duty) for estate planning and maybe some tax advices.\n\nBesides hiring a CPA to deal with my taxes, am I missing anybody else as far professional help goes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot for y'alls help!",
