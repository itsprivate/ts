I know he's already talking to one of them, but I don't know the details. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. Would this situation merit a warning to my friends not to heed his \"advice?\"\n\n**TLDR:** Met a man who I think is an insurance salesman masquerading as a financial advisor. He didn't know what I bonds were and suggested whole life insurance instead. He knows my friends and I know he's been talking to at least one of them.
