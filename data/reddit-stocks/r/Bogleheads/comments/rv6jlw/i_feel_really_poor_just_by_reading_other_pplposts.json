I have managed to save the last 8 years a bit above 100K.  \n\nI was living till then in an East European country and my income wasn't that great. I think at the moment I have an above average salary, but life in Munich is really expensive, i am paying 21 Euro per square meter rent, or around 2 Euro per square foot. \n\nI am moving with my girlfriend now and we are expecting a baby, so our family income will get much lower once the baby is born, and I don't think that my savings will shoot up much in the next 2-3 years, when I will be over 40. I am not planning to sell my ETFs and will try to contribute modestly but I don't see myself anytime soon hitting 1M. \n\nAm I the only one in this situation here?",
