I started out with a 10-fund portfolio strategy I did research on, but I am averse to REITS and some other selections in it. Curious anyone's thoughts on what I've got here. Moving forward I think I will just look at what's \"down\" and buy more shares of that.\n\nIt's been performing fairly well for how messy it is. I also think I am international heavy and considering paring back on that at the end of the year, but it could also be a good hedge against the expensive US P/E.\n\nLastly, VFTAX was my wife's selection. I told her to pick a fund and she chose that one. Might pick up some of the ETF as well. Hasn't varied too far from SP500 regular, and has a .1% higher expense ratio. Not too concerned about it.. good karma I suppose.\n\nThis is a taxable account separate from our retirements and savings... goal is to buy a sweet house and car(s) in 10-15 years. We are both 30 years old.\n\nThanks for reading",
