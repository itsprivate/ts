Many of you helped with allocation advice for him and it was greatly appreciated. Well, since then, my dad talked to a guy at his bank who has recommended the following: About 20% equities (a mix of small cap, mid, SP500 & emerging market funds), 60% fixed income (corporate and government bond funds like BIV) and then 15% “alternative investments,” which I’m unfamiliar with (JHEQX and BGCIX for example), and the rest kept in cash just in case. I follow a simple 3-fund strategy myself, but I’m not 70 and not facing a retirement. Is this complicated way really better for my dad (btw it comes with a 1% fee)? Or should I encourage him back toward a 2- or 3-fund portfolio (for example 20% VTI, 60% BND and 20% cash). Someone in the previous thread recommended VTINX or VSCGX, which is made for retirees and keeps it simple… My dad is relying on me (or the guy from the bank) for this, and I want to make sure I nudge him in the right direction. Thanks again for your help.",
