  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nPerhaps you could help shed some light behind the sub's love for allocating a certain portion of a portfolio to international equities (approximately 44% or whatever the market cap weight is at currently). Buffet and Bogle, two staunch Index investing advocates, recommend to the average investor that you should leave your international allocation at 20%, if any percentage of your portfolio at all - much preferring 100% us equities. With this sub being dedicated to Jack bogles principles, why are we going against his advice? I'm well aware that when international equities outperform, they well outperform US in short spurts. But I'm sure the likes of Bogle and buffet realized that as well, but kept their opinions the same. So why do we stray from their advice? \n\nThanks",
