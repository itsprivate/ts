  "selftext": "Hello, so I have a few things in my portfolio, basically three ETFs (VOO, and two others) and three stocks I thought I'd have for just \"buy/hold/see where they end up\" growth stocks. However, I figured since recently, I would just put 300 dollars a month or more, but minimum 300 dollars a month into VOO, and if possible, either VOO and another one of those ETFs. My portfolio already is like, 70% VOO. I plan on just keep adding at least 300 or more to VOO every month, since I just turned 21 a few months back and that's a decent amount for me to put in every month. Soon my portfolio probably will just be 80-90% VOO or higher  \n\n\nbut the thing that gets me, is.. On paper, all the research I've looked at, simply just investing and forgetting into VOO, should, over the course of me just living my life, generate wealth to the point where I can either live off the dividends from VOO, or sell shares of VOO to then put into a dividend ETF. But, thinking about it, it just seems too easy. I've always heard people talking about the stock market being some crazy lottery or some scam, but so far it's been fine for me, and I don't panic if I see any dips because I know the top 500 companies are going to be fine in the long term. Especially since with VOO/VTI, if those are down, it's not like I could have done anything different anyway. It's different if say, 70% of your portfolio dips while VTI/VOO is still high and green. But because I know that's my portfolio more or less, I'm not worried..   \n\n\nBut, am I missing something? It just feels, strange, that doing something so simple as just putting 300 into VOO over the course of me just living my life would generate a good investment. I don't need to do technical analysis, I don't need to monitor it 24/7, I don't need to do anything. I just DCA and that's it. It feels too simple but is it really that?",
