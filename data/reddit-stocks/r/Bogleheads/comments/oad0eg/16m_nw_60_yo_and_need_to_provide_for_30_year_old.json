He will continue in this house after I’m gone. He is very low maintenance - does not have expensive hobbies, tastes or needs. What’s the best way to invest this so that there are gains substantial enough to provide minimal income and conserve the wealth?  I have a fairly high tolerance for risk.  This huge lump sum just makes me nervous. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",
