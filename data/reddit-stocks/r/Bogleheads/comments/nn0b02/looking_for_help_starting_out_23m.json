Unfortunately, my parents passed away during COVID, but left me with some money. I really do not want to waste their money and prepare myself for retirement. Current plan is to throw my money into my company's Roth 403b to max the 5% match and then throw some money into a Roth IRA. I guess these are my non-taxable accounts. I guess my question is, with my inheritance would it be best to just open a Vanguard account and throw it all into VTSAX? This is my taxable account? Thank you so much.",
