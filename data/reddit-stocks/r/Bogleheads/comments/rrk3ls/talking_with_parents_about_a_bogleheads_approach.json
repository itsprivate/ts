As a birthday present this year he opened a Roth IRA in my name and bought stock related to electric vehicles.\n\nI just started a new job this year that’s been allowing me to save, so I also have a Roth IRA. I remembered that he had this other account for me so I called him up to get the details and consolidate the accounts so I wouldn’t run the risk of accidentally contributing too much. \n\nI appreciate what my dad did and that he’s looking out for me, but… he was trying to tell me that he was *confident* that picking stocks he felt would be winners would be the surefire path to big gains, and that if I really wanted to “get this account ripping” then I needed to buy more EV stocks and strategically buy and sell. \n\nThe kicker is that the value of the account ja currently down 20% from what it was six months ago, and he told me something like, “Sure, if you want the account to go up a few percentage points each year, go with your method. But I want to set you up with a lot of money for retirement.” \n\nSo… glad I know what’s going on with the account now, but it was interesting to see a big difference between how I’m planning for retirement and what my dad feels like is a good move. Not sure if I’ll really bring it up again because I’m not trying to convince him but I also don’t want him to be making decisions on my behalf, even though it was very kind of him to want me to be on my way to retirement.",
