Before I took over, the business was on a decline since my parents were getting too tired to manage the business. I only found out a few months later that the company had like $500k worth of debt so I felt extremely discouraged to continue the business. Fortunately, luck was on my side and the business started growing after maybe a year of me taking over. As of now, the debt has all been paid and I'm looking to invest all of my savings into an index fund that will generate 7-10% a year over a long period of time. The reason why I'm choosing index fund over other methods is because I feel like I already have a good stream of income and I want to \"secure\" it and slowly build up my wealth. I don't need to take any high risks since I can probably reach my goal within 10-15 years through the company income alone. But anything can happen and I'm a little bit scared any uncertainty that may happen to my business in the future. Maybe one day something bad will happen and then \\*POOF\\* there goes my business. In order to prevent me from going broke, my goal now is to have some amount put into an index fund and after 15 years, start withdrawing maybe 2-3% from it annually. My question is, after I stop putting more money in, will that money deplete as time goes by for let's say 50 years in future or do you guys think it has a high chance of growing even more? Sorry for the long post!",
