My company’s stock has appreciated a lot over the last few years, and the bulk of it I got when it was on the lower end. \n\nMy thought to diversify was to sell and toss it all in an index fund or other stocks. But if I were to sell a significant amount (say $600k), I would owe tens of thousands, maybe even close to $100k in capital gains. Then it would sit in an index fund or other stocks, appreciate over time, and I would have to pay on the gains *again* when I sold the first time. \n\nSo I’m trying to make sense of this and figure out the best way to move forward here. It seems like if I were to diversify, I’d basically be paying capital gains twice on the same money for no reason.",
