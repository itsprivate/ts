To understand why, we must ask ourselves why we are comparing with US in the first place.\n\nUS makes the majority of the world market cap, but this wasn't always the case. This means that during the process of becoming the country with the largest market cap, it must have had extraordinary stock returns, by definition. In other words, you are selecting the best performing country and comparing it with others, which is known as selection bias.\n\nIn 1990, you wouldn't be looking at US vs. ex-US. You would instead be looking at Japan vs. ex-Japan, and if you decided that you don't need ex-Japan exposure based on the part returns, you would have had very bleak returns coming forward. \n\nI'm not saying you cannot under any circumstances compare US to ex-US, however you must do it in a period where US didn't make up the majority of the market cap. A fair comparison would be in years 1950-1990. Unsurprisingly, the returns were very similar in this period.\n\nAnd as always, stay the course, stay diversified, don't stress about stocks too much, enjoy life.",
