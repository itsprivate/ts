  "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI just started trading in December of last year. Luckily, I was able to come out ahead in the GME / Crypto mess the past 5 months. I was able to turn my measly $3k in savings into $20k. Having said that, I have realized that the stress of high volatility is not for me, and I wish to make good choices with my financial gain instead of inevitably gambling it away. I stumbled upon this subreddit, and after lurking for a while, reading posts and the sidebar, and informing myself elsewhere, I have decided this is for me. Having said that, here are my questions. \n\nI opened a traditional IRA with Fidelity. It allows me to put in money for 2020 and 2021. Should I go ahead and put $6k into each?\n\nWhat should my positions be in a Fidelity IRA? \n\nI am leaning towards VTI/VXUS for my ETF's in my brokerage account. I have already purchased 10 shares of VTI before I decided to go this route so I have a bit of a start. Should I consider other combinations of funds or, like I see some people here do, go 100% into one?\n\nDo I need any bonds at all in my portfolio? I read that as you get older to to aquire bonds. I turned 40 this year but I plan on working and contributing to this until I am 60. \n\nAlso, on a side note for consideration, I will be retiring from my first job in 4 years when I am 44, so I will have a decent monthly pension already. I don't even know when I would actually need to use any of this investment money. My main goal is to accumulate wealth for security in the future if something were to happen to my pension as well as having something to leave for my family once I kick the bucket.\n\nI really appreciate your time and if there is any other advice you would like to give me it will be most welcome!",
