Every year since I inherited the account, we’ve just taken the RMD and otherwise let the financial advisor handle it, since we have a lot on our plates running a business. This year I decided to start paying attention and the fees that we’ve been being charged are outrageous. The advisor recently rebalanced the account and it looks like we are paying almost $1200 a quarter in advisory fees. Before I write his Dear John letter, I just have a quick question. It looks like the portfolio is currently a hot mess of tickers (roughly broken down into the following, with a sprinkle of cash):\n\n10% IWD\n10% IJJ\n5% IJT\n10% SPY\n7% BWX\n15% BND\n4% VWO\n13% VUG\n17% IEFA\n\nI’m thinking of moving everything to a basic 60% VTI, 40% VXUS setup. Are there any financial consequences I should be aware of to making these move? Consequences meaning, taxable moves in the account itself, not consequences to our personal planning. \n\nNote to lack of bonds: I’m 45 years old, but this account is not our “retirement plan”. Our business has been very successful, continued to be very successful during COVID, and also is located on a large amount of real estate. The business has a very small commercial mortgage but was mostly purchased with cash from the remainder of my inheritance, and has gained considerable value due to consumer demand and our “sweat equity”. We have no personal debt. \n\nThanks in advance!!!!",
