We have various savings account but I feel like investing in funds is the best way to save while giving yourself the ability to get a little extra help from the market. Traditional savings account offer next to nothing in return whereas funds do more. Want to know this community’s opinion on using etfs as a savings account to save for something. Have you done it? Why or why not? Any recommendations for funds?\n\nWe have around $10k to put in immediately and then have monthly contributions of a few hundred from my wife and I both. I don’t think using a super risky etf like ARK etc is the best bet. Something safe and while giving great returns is what this subreddit is all about so hoping you guys can offer some good advice! Thank you in advance!",
