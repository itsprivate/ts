Looking at the trend graph on mint made me appreciate how far I've come, from an empty bank account in August 2009 when I had just turned 21, having just graduated from college smack dab in the middle of the worst recession in recent memory, having no idea what a 401k was except that my dad told me \"put 15% in and pretend the money never existed\" (I had no idea what funds to allocate into so I just put an equal percent into every fund my provider offered, LOL) all the way until the beginning of this year, when I realized I needed to actually understand finances and investing after the GME and Dogecoin runups where I felt FOMO from never having consciously invested before. That feeling eventually brought me to bogleheads, where I am now the happy owner of a target date fund in my 401k, VTSAX and VTIAX in my brand new Roth IRA account, and AVUV and AVDV in a small taxable account.\n\nI know I'm young compared to some of the other investors here, and 12 years is just a blip as far as historical trends, but I'm putting this here to let others know that you can have absolutely no knowledge of finances, not even realize you have an investment account, never pick a single stock, never read a company earnings report, never know if the stock market is up or down, and over time be laying down the foundation for a future of financial independence.\n\nP.S. Ignore the blip in the middle of the graph, I moved jobs and never added that other job's 401k account to Mint, so it looks like my money disappeared for a few years lol. The blip near the end of the graph I think is when I moved a bunch of money from my bank to Vanguard on the last day of the month and so that money got double counted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1lsubdbrdg71.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=030d79e9072a26ffe5ac2b9858172bcb4c396c82",
