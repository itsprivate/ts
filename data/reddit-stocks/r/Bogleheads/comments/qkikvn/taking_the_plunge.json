  "selftext": "Hi Bogleheads!\n\nI am a 38 year old that finally decided that the future was now, and I had to start making smart moves if I ever wanted to retire. I've got a job that sustains me more than paycheck to paycheck, and I'm able to think about the future in a more purposeful way.\n\nI'm a former teacher and public servant, so I have \\~125k in my pensions that I want to work for me now that I'm out of public service. I had chosen in my youth to go with the \"uninvested\" plan, and so my money has just basically been sitting there since I stopped actively contributing. I am pulling my pension balance into an IRA, and will be pursuing the 3-fund approach. I know that I can't beat the market. I don't have the fortitude to \"day trade\" and an incredibly low risk tolerance psychologically, so I want to chunk it into an IRA and do my best to forget it. What I CAN do, is HOLD THE LINE. I've been studying investment since about February, and trying to learn as much as I can, as I come from a VERY financially illiterate family and NEVER learned anything about the market previously. My ignorance is my pain, now that I see what I could have/should have been doing for YEARS. Oh, investment regret!\n\nAnyway, the Boglehead way seems like it matches MY WAY, and I'm ready to drop my cash and commit. What I can't seem to parse in my own head, and across the books and resources I've read, is the difference/advantages/disadvantages to the \"Mutual Fund versus ETF\" debate. I just can't seem to have it make sense which is better for me and why. For example VTSAX versus VTI. What are the functional differences here? Would one work better for me, or are they the similar slices of the same pie? Could someone explain it to me like I'm a kindergartener?  \n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nGoing with 3 fund approach: US Stocks/World/Bonds\n\nHave a lump sum to invest that is my former pension that wasn't \"working\" for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\nWhat's the difference between investing in mutual fund versus ETF?\n\nAnything else that I should be thinking about?",
