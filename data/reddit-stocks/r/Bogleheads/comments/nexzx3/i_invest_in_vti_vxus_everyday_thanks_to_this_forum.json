I guess it’s still qualifies as dollar cost averaging :) \nSo I have been investing $60 every working day since 1st of February 2021, using Fidelity and it’s capability to buy stock in dollar QTY instead of share quantity .\n\nOut of these $60, I invest $40 in VTI and $20 in VSUX. I plan to continue to do so or increase the contribution as my income increases for as many years as possible. \n\nJust wanted to post this to thank you all for your cool advice !\nHopefully it all works out in the future :)",
