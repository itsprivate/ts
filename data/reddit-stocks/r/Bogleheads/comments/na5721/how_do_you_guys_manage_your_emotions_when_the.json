I know that I am investing for a long time period (>10 years) and that I should not worry about those short term fluctuations.\n\nHowever today because of that fall, I started to think irrationally and to be driven by emotions. I started overchecking how the market was doing and I started thinking that maybe I should sell, since the market could go even lower (we are in all time highs, in the middle of a pandemic, etc. all what is said by stock crash doomsayers). I know that during my \"investor\" journey I will see even greater market declines. I am therefore concerned that I have already been tempted to act irrationally today, so when there are stronger downturns that may be a real problem.\n\nFor this reason, I wanted to ask you how do you manage your emotions and not let yourselves be influenced by what happens in the short term? How do you rationalize the situation and don't let your emotions be an obstacle?  \n\n\nI know that it may be a silly question. However, as someone new to investing I am sure that there is a lot that I can learn from you regarding those points!  \n\n\nThanks in advance :)",
