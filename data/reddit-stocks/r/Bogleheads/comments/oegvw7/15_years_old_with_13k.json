I am aware that there is a lot of overlapping with all of these therefore I wanted an outside opinion on which ones I should pick, or any other suggestions on what I should put my money into. Being 15 I obviously have time on my side and I want to use that to my advantage. I’m looking into the extreme long term here, I’m thinking about getting a Roth IRA too. Any advice helps, thanks.",
