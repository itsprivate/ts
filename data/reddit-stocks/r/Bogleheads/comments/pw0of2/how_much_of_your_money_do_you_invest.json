I currently cannot really afford to invest much of my monthly wages so I've only set a small recurring deposit into Vanguard (13%). Planning to put a bigger amount (19%) into a standard savings account because I need some liquid cash right now - unfortunately I often have a bunch of surprise expenses. Previously I was putting all of that money (about 32%) into savings. As my income increases and I'm able to put away more money, I plan to allocate more to the index fund.\n\nHow much do you guys allocate to investments?",
