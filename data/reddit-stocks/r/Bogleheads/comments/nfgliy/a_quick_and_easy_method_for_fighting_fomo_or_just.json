Just wanted to provide a mental hack I came up with.\n\nThis past January, I watched the news with a pit in my stomach. Rona cases rising, panic over the events on 1/6/21, contested election, national guard in DC, George Floyd decision outstanding, and coronavirus cases rising. \n\nBy the way did you hear cases are rising? And there are variant strains? Also, evictions are going down and the housing market is surely about to crash, valuations can't stay so high. Did you hear that cases are rising? And then GME nonsense went down and I thought, DAMN, totally overvalued! Shoe shine boy is giving stock tips, it's the end of times!\n\nI was about to pull my money out of the market (some target date funds) and throw it all in bonds. Surely, I thought, the crash is coming. Instead, I remembered to not panic. I calmed my tits. I set a reminder in my calendar for the middle of March. I would wait and see and then make a decision then. \n\nMarch came. The world had not ended. In fact, the market was on a huge run. \n\n**TLDR**: When you start to panic about your investments, set a calendar reminder in a few weeks. Name it something like, \"I think the market will be at X on this date\". See if you were right. Chances are that you were incorrect in your assessment.",
