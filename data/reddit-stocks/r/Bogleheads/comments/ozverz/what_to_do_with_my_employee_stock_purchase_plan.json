I stopped contributing several years ago and essentially left the account alone, where it's been growing nicely. I'm pleased with the returns but I'm not too keen on keeping this much of my portfolio with one stock. As a way to diversify, I'm wondering what the best strategy is to reinvest the funds that the ESPP holds into an index fund with Vanguard. I have my Roth IRA with Vanguard and have been considering opening a brokerage account as a way to invest more on top of my maxed out 401k and Roth. Can I just transfer my shares from my ESPP to Vanguard and convert them to shares of VTSAX? Or do I need to sell them outright and pay whatever capital gains are owed?",
