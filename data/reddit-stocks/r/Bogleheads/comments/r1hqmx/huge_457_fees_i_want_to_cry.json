I looked at the plan's offerings and saw it had Vanguard target index funds with a fee of only .13%. I was excited!\n\nSo, my dad had a meeting with the rep to sign up and it turns out his 457 plan adds a fee of .45% and another fee of .65% on top of .13% charged by Vanguard. So the total cost to invest in this Vanguard index fund is 1.23%, whereas you can invest directly with Vanguard for only .13%.\n\nIn the end, the rep actually allocated 90% of the portfolio to an actively managed T Rowe Price target date fund with a final fee of 1.51% because the rep said the T Rowe Price fund had a better performance history than Vanguard. The final 10% the rep allocated to an actively managed REIT with a final fee of 1.98%.\n\nI feel horrible for my dad. Is he getting screwed or what?\n\nAlthough the fees are so high it is my understanding it's still better for my dad to do this because  of tax advantages. Of course I explained to my dad he should be maxing out his self directed IRA first and then contribute to the 457 plan.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the rep for the 457 plan said the average mutual fund cost in the U.S. is 1.5%. Is this actually true?",
