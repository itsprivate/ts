Been browsing this subreddit for a couple of days and am amazed by the awesome support that everyone has shown.\n\nAs a beginner investor, there are a couple of questions I hope you guys can help me out with. My apologies if these questions are unintelligent.\n\nIm looking to invest in VT with 20k, should I be dumping all of it at once or should I spread it out to achieve DCA despite having the lump sum available now? Also, I understand that as much as I should not be timing the market, is it a bad time to enter the ETF now especially when its at an all time high? Lastly, does it make sense to hold a majority of VT with a small portion with VTI if I want to have more exposure to the US market, or would it better to simply have VTI and VXUS combined.\n\nThanks everyone! :)",
