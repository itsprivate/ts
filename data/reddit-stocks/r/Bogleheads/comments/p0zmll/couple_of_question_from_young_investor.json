I\\`ve decided to start investing every month for my retirement. I am 30 years old from Georgia (the country, not the state) and have couple of question:\n\n1) which platform should I use? I have an active account on eToro. Is it okay to use it for my retirement portfolio? Other option which I know of is Interactive Brokers, but I\\`ve never used it.\n\n2) I can afford to invest 100-150$ every month (unfortunately I cannot afford more at the moment, but god bless compound interest). This means that if I use eToro - I can\\`t afford to buy bonds, because minimum buy amount is 50$ and I don\\`t want to have more than 10% bond on my portfolio.\n\n3) should I even buy bonds now or in the next 10 years?\n\n4) on eToro I can\\`t find VT, but there is [VT.US](https://www.etoro.com/markets/vt.us) \\- is it the same thing?\n\n5) should I go VT only or VTI/VXUS (In this case what should be the percentage of VTI?)\n\nThanks once again for the great work you are doing!",
