Just trying to figure out how to best allocate these funds.\n\nSome context: I’m 30 years old, I have about $27,000 in my Roth 401K, I have zero debt, my gross pay is $105,000, and I have about $25,000 cash on hand. I own a property with my family as well. I’m engaged and getting married next year. We are planning to start trying for a child late next year. My expenses tend to be about half my paycheck so I’ve been saving about half my pay for many many months now. \n\nThat being said, I’m trying to set myself and my future family up for success. To continue on this path I basically concluded I need to put the max contribution to a Roth IRA ASAP. After reading, I felt that Vanguard’s brokerage account made the most sense as I want to set it and forget it (unless I need to rebalance the account). I plan on contributing $6,000 every year if possible. My question is related to how to best invest. I am aware of the 3 fund portfolio, 2 fund portfolio, and other funds that combine both international and domestic stocks. Currently, I’m looking at doing 80% in VTSAX and 20% in VTIAX. From what I understand, bonds is not something I should really invest in right now due to my age and how many more years I have to retire. To decrease the volatility in domestic stocks, I thought 20% in international would be helpful. Both of these also have pretty low expense ratios and seem like a good pair for the long run.\n\nAny thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated. I still have time to decide as the funds are being processed with my bank and such. \n\nOne other question I have is what would make sense to invest in a personal investment account that is taxed? Do you get taxes on unrealized gains every year even if you don’t sell your stocks? I’m trying to also have a portfolio that I could liquidate in case I needed funds, but most likely won’t have to outside my 401K and IRA. Any recommendations on particular ETFs or ways to diversify outside of my tax-benefited accounts is also appreciated. Planning to use M1 finance for my personal investment account.\n\nThanks for the help and all the information this subreddit has provided!",
