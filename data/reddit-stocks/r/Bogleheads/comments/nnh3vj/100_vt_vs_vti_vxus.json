However I would like to point out that the broker fee is inevitable for me as I am from South East Asia and invest through tradestation global (whitelabel of IBKR), I am paying 1.5usd per trade and no fractional share allowed. All the broker here has a fee and I can't sign up for a Vanguard/fidelity. \n\nSecondly there's no capital gain tax in my country here. So I guess it doesn't make much difference for me. The only benefit  for choosing VTI + VXUS is that I am able to customize the ratio of them when I feel like it. \n\nThanks for answering my questions",
