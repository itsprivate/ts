I will have a stipend and low living expenses and will be able to save $1250/month from a paid University Fellowship (I will not be working an outside job during the program). My questions is, once I max out my Roth IRA from the $1250/month contributions, where should I then put that money? Should I open a taxable account and continue to invest in index funds there? Or should I use the $1250 to bolster my emergency fund? Or split 50/50? Any thoughts or suggestions would help. \n\nI am not working at the moment, but I currently have a $10k emergency fund, $15k in my Roth, and $5k from an old 403b, and no credit card debt. I do have an $11k car loan (2.9% interest over 72 months). I plan to pay this off early in 4-5 years with cash flow. I just got it in May of this year and I am worried about reducing my credit score (730) if I pay it all off too quickly. But maybe that’s where the $1250 should go? \n\nThank you for your help/suggestions.\n\nEdit: Added more detail for clarity",
