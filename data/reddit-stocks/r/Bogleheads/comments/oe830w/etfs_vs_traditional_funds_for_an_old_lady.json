I live off a pension, SS and small part-time salary. I really haven’t touched my American Funds investments except for making gradual Roth Conversions over the past 15 years. They have grown nicely and their expense ratios are not higher than .75%. I have a large enough cash emergency fund and expect to get my first RMD from American Fds soon. I plan to invest the RMD in Vanguard but after following this sub I see that I have way too many funds through Vanguard already. I want to simplify things but still have fun with some of the investments. As I simplify, should I invest primarily in traditional funds or etfs at my age?",
