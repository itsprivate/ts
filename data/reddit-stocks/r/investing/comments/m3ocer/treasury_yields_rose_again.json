From what I understand, the auction was able to sell bonds and thus the yield rate didn’t raise much at all.

TNX is the 10 year treasury indicator (idk if it’s a stock or a index or what). And I see that it’s at 1.626 which is higher than it closed at from the auction on Wednesday (1.52 or something). So why did it jump up again? I thought it was supposed to be steady after the auction on Wednesday kind of set things in place. Does it matter really?",
