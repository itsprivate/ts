The decline did not continue, but things still don’t go their way, while the general market continues to grow.\n\nTesla is a great company, but I don't want to buy its shares even today. In order for the company's valuation to be justified, in a few years, Elon Musk and his team must not only maintain leadership in the growing segment of electric cars, but also win competition in new segments. For example, self-driving cars, driverless taxis, you can also take over the orbital transport sector. Oh, this is already SpaceX...\n\nIn short, Tesla is still unreasonably expensive. However, a reasonable investor today should take a course towards clean energy. All developed countries' politicians talk about this, and they are ready to provide support. It is a really promising investment trend.\n\nCheaper companies developing renewable energy sources (renewables) would be a good alternative to Tesla. Here is a list of ETFs ([https://www.etf.com/channels/renewable-energy-etfs](https://www.etf.com/channels/renewable-energy-etfs)) that you can use. By investing in them, we get more diversification, lower risks (P/E of companies in the sector is in the 30-40x region; most companies are profitable), as well as the same \"discount\" as on Tesla shares (renewables fell with it).\n\nTake a look at the graph below.
