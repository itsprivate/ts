My annual salary is around 80-85K. I just turned 25. \n\nI have around 50K ready to be used. I’m thinking of keeping 5k for emergency fund reasons. \n\nI was thinking of just putting in 45k spread across various ETFs in a roboadvisor. I’m a fairly new investor so I’m still learning.\n\nMy friend on the other hand has made a lot of money with successful investments. He’s won big with Shopify, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc. Easily has over $300K now in assets. He kinda inspires me. Lol. He tells me that at the annual return rate of even 10% per year for ETF’s is nothing. Doesn’t excite him. But he told me I need to really do my research on individual stocks if I were to purchase them. \n\nOn the OTHER hand, I was just thinking why not just save up money and move out eventually? But the thing is... my lifestyle at this current moment doesn’t really call for a drastic move like moving out. I live at my dads and I don’t pay rent/food. I do feel like sometimes I’m missing out? But that feeling goes away.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would love to hear advice.",
