In fact, I was a derivatives trader at RBC during the dot.com implosion.  But on a whole, I've never left the market and have been very well rewarded for it. Thoughout that time, there has been constant gloom and doom right in the face of objective evidence that the market always tends upwards due to technology, globalization and increasing market participation.  All my assets are split between investment properties and equities. In the two decades I've been investing, I was told every single year that I was going to lose it all.  I'm 46 now. Fully retired all thanks to the stock market and real estate market. I still trade, holding only 8 positions. The rental income from multiple properties is well north of what my family requires each year.\n\nFolks who are constantly saying the stock market and real estate market is going crash, where do you put your money while you're waiting for this to happen?\n\nEdit: didn't mean for this to come off snarky.  Investing is about the next best alternative.  What is the next best alternative for folks who think the capital markets or real estate markets are going to crash?
