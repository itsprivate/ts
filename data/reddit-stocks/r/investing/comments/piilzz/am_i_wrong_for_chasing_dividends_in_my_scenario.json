It’s possible we will have to reduce it.  \n\nI have approximately $28k across about a dozen stocks at the moment.  All pay at least a 3% dividend and IMO have limited downside in the long term.  Dividends pay me about $1375 per year at this point.  \n\nMy thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.  It’s nice knowing that even if I have to reduce contributions to the brokerage account from our paychecks, I will still be generating some money to invest further with.  \n\nThoughts on this?",
