They say they are waiting for the dip to buy a S&amp;P500 index fund at a discount when the market crashes.\n\nWe all know of the saying 'time in the market is better than timing the market'. Even though this is historically correct it is still psychologically hard to stay 100% invested when many think the market is overvalued. But it is also painful to see the market keep going up as you hold a bunch of cash doing nothing but losing value to inflation.\n\nFor this discussion I am talking about an investor who basically is just buying S&amp;P500 index funds. So what is an alternative to holding 20% cash and waiting for the dip?\n\n#Alternative to Holding 20% Cash\n\nHold 100% index funds. 0% cash\n\nIf the market keeps going up, great! You are maximizing your profits.\n\nIf the market crashes then what? Sell 10% of your S&amp;P500 funds and buy leveraged S&amp;P500 index funds at 2x or 3x. Of course the success of this depends on how good you can judge if the market is reasonably near a bottom. But the same can be said about someone with 20% cash and waiting for a dip.\n\n\n\n#You need to be correct TWICE if you hold 20% Cash\n\nTo me this is better than holding 20% cash and waiting for a dip. Why? Because if you are holding for a dip you need to be correct TWICE. First you need to be correct when you make the decision that you are going to hold 20% cash. You need to know the market is overheated. This is very hard to do. \n\n#Many people thought the market was overvalued in 2016. The S&amp;P500 is up 100% since then.\n\nThe second time you need to be right is when you decide to buy the dip. Are you sure this is really the bottom or reasonably near to it? If you are wrong then you could get burned twice.\n\nSo holding 20% Cash you need to be right TWO TIMES: when you decide to hold cash and when you decide to buy the dip.\n\nIn contrast if you hold 100% index funds you only have to be correct once. When the market crashes you have to decide when it is reasonably near the bottom and then you can exchange 10% of your 1x index for 2x or 3x index.\n\nPersonally I don't believe in waiting for a dip or buying 2x index. But if someone is thinking of going 20% cash this might be a good alternative.",
