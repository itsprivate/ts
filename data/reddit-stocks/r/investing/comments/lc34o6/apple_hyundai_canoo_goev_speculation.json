They indicated that this co-developed platform would be used in future vehicles. The E-GMP platform they eventually released seems way less advanced than Canoo's platform in the photos (e.g. it has struts vs Canoo's with leaf spring suspension), so the E-GMP platform could be the intermediate step until the co-developed platform is ready.\n\nApple tried to buy Canoo for it’s skateboard platform in 2020 and was turned down by Canoo. This makes a lot of sense for Apple because Canoo platform is really advanced (steer-by-wire, leaf spring suspension, crash test incorporated into skateboard, batteries incorporated into structure, very modular and fast development times/costs) and lets Apple focus on what they excel at, which is tech and quick development cycles.\n\nApple eventually forms a manufacturing partnership with Hyundai and it's rumored they're using Hyundai skateboard in the \"initial\" version, which is important because it signals they still want to use 3P skateboard. It seems that while they are likely using the E-GMP platform for the first iteration, the 2024 timeline easily puts them in line to use the new Canoo/Hyundai platform when it is done, which is consistent with the fact that Apple has already tried to purchase Canoo specifically for it's skateboard platform.\n\n**tl;dr -** seems very possible that the Apple car will use the Canoo skateboard as the foundation",
