They've acquired \"917 million in debt and equity financing.\" During the short interval that the market has been open, I've seen AMC fluctuate from 4.60-something to 4.13. Last time it got this high, it ended up hemorrhaging. That was based on the news of a vaccine, if I recall. But perhaps this rise isn't quite as much a mirage, as it's actually on the strength not merely of expectations and hopes, but an actual, tangible financial development.\n\nSo, what do you all think? Is AMC stock going to soar or at least make a steady turn around? One thing I'll say is, they need to actually start putting out movies that bring people to the theaters. And hopefully hammer out exclusive deals that don't involve sharing with streaming platforms. Godzilla vs Kong is on the horizon and perhaps that can rake in some old-fashioned blockbuster numbers. But they need to start putting tushes in seats somehow.",
