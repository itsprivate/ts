This is on top of the 18% return  during 2020. When measured from the March lows, it is now up 87%  compared to the 44% for the S&P 500 and 68% for the NASDAQ.\n\nFrom  a macro perspective, small caps tend to lead during the beginning of a  new bull market. Based on everything I've read, most predictions are  that it will continue to outperform the broader market for the  foreseeable future and this correction is a very good buying point.\n\nIt's  also a solid bet if you're bullish on the reopening trade and/or want  some diversification.
