But fail to apply this to investing in risky stocks when you are young. \n\nLets say you are 20 years old and you have $10k to invest. Its common to hear people say you can be more risky since you are so young. And even if you do YOLO and lose it all you can easily recover. But think opportunity cost. What did you really lose doing a YOLO?\n\n$10,000\n\nInvest in an index fund that returns 8.5% annualized return \n\nWithdraw at 65 years old\n\nThat $10k becomes $400k. So you basically lost $400k because you YOLOed on a risky stock.\n\nIf you hold till 70 you lost $600k. \n\nAt age 90 you can give your children and grandchildren $3.2 million. Or you could have fun and lose it all on a risky stock. \n\nBottom line is a young persons greatest asset is TIME. Throwing investment time away by taking unnecessary risk is a massive mistake.\n\nI’m not saying don’t buy stocks that are risky hyper growth companies. But also don’t gamble needlessly.
