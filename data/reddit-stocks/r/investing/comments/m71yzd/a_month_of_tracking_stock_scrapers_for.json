EDIT: The sheet was locking up due to too many people so Google suggested I publish it, so here's the new link. If this doesn't update regularly let me know and I will give the link to the spreadsheet again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMethodologies:\n\n* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet\n* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before\n* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker \"high\" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data\n* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are\n   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)\n   * Which social media is the most profitable?\n   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)\n   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**\n\n1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing\n2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money\n3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category\n4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money\n5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other interesting finds:**\n\nStocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible\n\nStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nObviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:\n\n1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice\n2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far\n3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my \"responsible\" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better.",
