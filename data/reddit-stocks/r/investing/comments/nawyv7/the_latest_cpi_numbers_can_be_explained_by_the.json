I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.\n\n#The month on month data:\n\nThere's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:\n\n- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. \n\n- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.\n\n- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).\n\nAs you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.\n\nThe next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).\n\n- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) \n\nAs you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. \n\n#The Year on Year CPI data:\n\nIf you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. \n\nAnyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. \n\nTLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",
