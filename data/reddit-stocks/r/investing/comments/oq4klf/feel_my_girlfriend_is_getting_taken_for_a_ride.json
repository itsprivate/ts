I am somewhat well versed in investing but will be the first to admit I am no expert. Her money is mainly invested in funds that seem to have really high expense ratios (AHLYX @ 1.61%, LGLFX @ .65%, QQQ @ .2%)\n\nI feel the expense of these funds is going to eat away at her long term earnings and that she should ditch the advisor and just manage her money herself by putting it into broad based ETFs like VTSAX. Am I wrong here? Does the way her financial advisor have her money look alright? Advice would be greatly appreciated! She has a zoom meeting with him this week and I want to be able to coach her ahead of time with some advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
