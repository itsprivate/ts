This number will act as a multiplier and will be helpful later.\n\nNow that we know all of this we need to project future free cash flow growth into the future. This is where my estimations will be different from others and my numbers should be taken with a grain of salt and any and all information extracted from this point forward is not financial advice.\n\nAlibaba has consistently been growing their top line revenue around 40-50% per year. Their free cash flow growth has been consistently growing at 30-40%. I’m going to assume for the sake of simplicity that it will continue at a rate of 30% for the next ten years.\n\nTo do this, we take the original $72 in free cash flow per share and multiply it by 1.3^10. The 1.3 is for 30% growth and the 10 is for ten iterations of growth or ten years. This comes out to be $992 of free cash flow in ten years.\n\nNow we need to discount it back by the appropriate discount rate. This is where it gets personal. The discount rate can be considered to be a lot of different things. Interest rate, Weighted Average Cost of Capital, and minimum desired return are all acceptable use cases.\n\nNow let’s say for sake of argument that I wanted to be super conservative. I’m going to use a 25% discount rate to account for risks and desired rate of return. I can take the $992 future free cash flow and divide it by 1.25^10 and I get a discounted free cash flow of $106.50. This is the intrinsic cash flow baked into the company’s future prospects.\n\nNow I can take that ratio from earlier to reflect what it would be worth in share price terms if everything else was constant. Multiply $106.50 by 2.9 and I get $308.85. This is the intrinsic value based on the numbers we used.\n\n\nTLDR: Intrinsic value is $308.85 based on the numbers we used.\n\nEdit: numbers I used for Alibaba’s free cash flow are in Chinese RMB. Regardless, this does not change the growth or the relative discounting method I used.\n\nEdit: Please understand this was meant to be a very simple outline of how someone would approach this model of valuation. I baked A TON of assumptions into the end result. Please do your own research.",
