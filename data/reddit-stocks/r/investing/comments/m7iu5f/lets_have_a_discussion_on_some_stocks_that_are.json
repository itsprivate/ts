Huge growth ahead.\n\nBRK.B(Berkahire Hathway): When Warren buys his stock, you know it’s undervalued.\n\nBABA(Alibaba): While some might disagree sighting China danger, I think it’s overblown. And when people tend to fear something too much, that's when they undervalue things.\n\nSTMP(Stamps.com): An underrated gem which seems like too good to be true for its lowly valuation. I have tried to find some good reasons why this was so blindingly undervalued. I couldn’t find anything reasonable to allow for such a huge discounted valuation.\n\nTYO:7974(Nintendo): The best IP company to own for the upcoming gaming decades. At least 40% undervalued according to my base case estimates(using conservative figues).\n\nGOLD(Barrick Gold): This one is a little more dependent on the assumption that gold won't tank any more. If it doesn’t, I don't know why you wouldn’t want to own this one.\n\nPFE(Pfizer): I don't know how this could be in such a valuation despite their good pipeline and numerous ventures.\n\nULVR.L(Unilever): This one is also dependent on the assumption that GBP doesn’t rise any higher. If it doesn’t, you can thank me later.\n\n\nThat's some of the tickers that I think of. What are some of the tickers that you can think of and why?",
