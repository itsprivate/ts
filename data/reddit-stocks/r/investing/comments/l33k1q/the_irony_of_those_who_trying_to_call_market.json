Yet, he owns Quantum Scape which went public via SPAC. The company has no plan to generate any revenue until 2024-2025. I'm sure he has been rewarded handsomely, but being an early investor has restricted him to sell shares to the public until lock up expiration. So all he can do right now is watching his investment goes up and down in wild swings.\n\nIrony 2: He is an advocated green energy investors. He has called out Tesla a bubble, which many by the time now know. He was wondering why the market hasn't taken notices to his green energy investments for 10 years. That was until Tesla showed up of course. The fact of his EVs' and other green energies companies' valuation are going into bubble territory is exactly because of Tesla's leading the charge. Perhaps he should sell some of those investments if he thinks those are in the bubbles as well?\n\nYou have many other examples. Even legendary investor Warren Buffet, who advocated \"Be greedy when others are fearful,\" was very fearful just like every other human beings during the COVID crash in February & March of 2020. Berkshire was not executing its strategy and sold many of its holding at rock bottom. If Buffet was brave at that moment like he did during the financial crisis of 2008, I'm sure Berkshire's stock would outperform the market by a large margin by now.\n\nMoral of the story: Listen to what people said, **but pay attention to what they actually DO.** No one knows when the bubble may pop. If you're thinking long term, just stay the course. You will ride through bubble pops and still come up on tops in the end if you're investing in good companies.\n\nFun fact: Fidelity has done yearly studies of their clients' accounts performance, for many years. The best performing portfolio? Well, Fidelity found out those account holders were no longer living in this world, so \"Hold-onto dare Life\" until your dick dries up.",
