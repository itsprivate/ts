But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.\n\nThis is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.\n\nAnd last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.\n\nVanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.\n\nIt will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.\n\nAny money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.\n\nHagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'\n\nInitially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.\n\nThose with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.\n\nThey will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.\n\nSavers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.\n\nMeanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.\n\nHagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'\n\n\nVanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. \n\nThese alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.\n\nAdvice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.\n\nVanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.\n\nHagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.\n\nYet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.\n\nHagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'\n\nMost independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.\n\nNew player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.\n\nJeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.\n\nNutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.\n\nOngoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.\n\nFidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",
