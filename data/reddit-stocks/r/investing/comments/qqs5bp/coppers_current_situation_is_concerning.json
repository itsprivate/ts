I also placed some on [Comstock Mining Inc](https://www.comstockmining.com/).([LODE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LODE/)), and their primary focus of the company’s exploration efforts are their projects in the Dayton Resource/Spring Valley as well as the Lucerne resource area.\n\nI am not planning to invest on any anytime soon, since I feel a little anxious with all the investments I made seeing how volatile the situation is right now.",
