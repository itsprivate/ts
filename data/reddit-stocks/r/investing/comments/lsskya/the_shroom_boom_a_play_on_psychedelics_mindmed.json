The proof-of-concept study is planned to take place at two trial sites, including Maastricht University. The principal investigator of the study is Kim Kuypers, one of the world’s top psychedelics microdosing clinical researchers.\n\nThey’re creating a new paradigm for mental health care that incorporates both psychedelic-assisted therapy and non-hallucinogenic take-home medicines to help patients overcome and break through.\n\n*LSD/MDMA Combo*\n- With this innovative treatment paradigm, they are looking to bring the participants outside the bounds of their everyday perceptions, facilitating new states of consciousness and flexibility.

The other, a proposed ballot initiative on track for 2022, would put Washington on par with Oregon, decriminalizing small-scale possession of all drugs and legalizing mushrooms for broader therapeutic use.\n\n- HAWAII\n\nIn late January, Hawaii announces push to legalize [Psychedelic Mushroom Therapy](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/hawaii-could-legalize-psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-under-new-senate-bill/) under new Senat Bill.\n>The measure, if approved, would direct the state Department of Health to “establish designated treatment centers for the therapeutic administration of psilocybin and psilocyn,” two psychoactive substances produced by certain fungi; It would also remove the two compounds from the state’s list of Schedule I controlled substances and create a seven-person psilocybin review panel to assess the impacts of the policy change.\n\n- FLORIDA\n\nA few weeks ago, a Florida lawmaker aims to [Legalize Psychedelic Mushrooms by 2022](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-bill-aims-to-legalize-medical-psychedelic-mushrooms-11835699)\n>Modeled after a recent voter-approved initiative in Oregon, the proposal from State Rep.
