Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.\n* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.\n* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.\n* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.\n\nThese companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend either preceding or following earnings.\n\nTL;DR: RIP retail investors that bought into COVID IPOs.",
