At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $**429**. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!\n* DASH crashed from its ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.\n* BMBL halved from its $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.\n* WISH crashed from its ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.\n* CPNG is down from its ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.\n* SPAC merger Opendoor crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.\n* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled and employees can finally sell their RSUs next week.\n\nThe one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.\n\nBut it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which, except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.\n\n* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.\n* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.\n* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.\n* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.\n\nThese companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend either preceding or following earnings.\n\nTL;DR: RIP retail investors that bought into COVID IPOs.",
