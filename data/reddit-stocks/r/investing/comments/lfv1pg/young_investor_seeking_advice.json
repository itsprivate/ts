Other than that i have looked at a few stocks i would like to invest a bit in as well, those are Paypal holdings. Apple, and google. Really just making this post to hear if you guys have any tips or advice and what you think of the ETFs/stocks I have chosen so far. Thank you for your time (time horizon 10 years+)",
