The Company also hosts an annual music festival, \"SweetWater 420 Fest,\" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.\n\nThis move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base.
