These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.\n\n\nI made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!\n\n\nMine are as follows:\n\n\n1.Applovin\n\n1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. \n\n\n2.Vizio\n\n2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. \n\n\n3.Nextdoor\n\nJust going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. \n\nI am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. \n\n4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. \n\n\nThere are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I'm personally bullish on and probably won't get as much attention.",
