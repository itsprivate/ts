One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further.
