This is truly my buy-and-hold account.\n\nSo obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.\n\nI have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.\n\nThis is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.\n\nFor this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).”\n\nThis portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.\n\nHere is how I have invested this $10,000:\n\n* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\n* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)\n* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)\n* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)\n* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)\n\nSo far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. \n\nI have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.\n\nAs I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.\n\nI have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.\n\nI recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk. If it’s money you don’t want to risk losing this might be worth checking out.",
