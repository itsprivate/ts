As many of you probably know, Cathy's investment strategy is based on Wright's law, which states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline at a consistent rate. According to Cathy, ARK's research strategy starts by discovering when the costs in various innovative industries have declined to a low enough point to indicate exponential growth in that industry, and therefore the leading companies in that industry. \n\nSeems simple enough, but I'm curious as to how a retail investor would ever be able to find the relevant information to use a similar strategy. I can only assume that ARK has tons of research vehicles in play to analyze how quickly costs change and at what price level customers will start entering into the market. I've been trying to think if there is a way to find this information in a companies financials, maybe hidden within some relationship of numbers but I just don't know.\n\nDoes anybody have anything to contribute? I'm really just curious if other people have gone down this path and whether they have gotten anywhere with it.",
