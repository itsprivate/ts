So that's $ 1400 montly in indexes.\n\nI'm also stacking about $ 2000 in cash every month. This goes hopefully into the market in the future or as downpayment on my mortgage (depending on inflation and change in interest).\n\nOther than that I have a stock picking PF with a handful of companies. \n\nNow here's the kicker. I'm aware I can't time the market. I don't believe I can, but the question is whether I see a big upside in indexes from here on. And I'm not sure I do. The markets might keep growing a bit more, but I feel the risk reward is unfavourable atm, and I wonder if indexes isn't the right thing now. I honestly feel far more comfortable with doing value buys, and there's less risk of buying dividend blue chips who aren't in favour.\n\nA few months ago my last big buy happened and that was Bayer AG. After that I've kind of been on the sidelines as I haven't seen anything interesting.\n\nWhat's your opinion on investing right now? Would you stick to investing heavily in indexes or rotate into stock picking?  If so, would you sell off index funds? Or ride it out?",
