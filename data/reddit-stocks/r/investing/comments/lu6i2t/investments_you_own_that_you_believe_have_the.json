I guess if everyone recognizes something as a good investment, then it would no longer be 10X as everyone is already buying that thing. \n\nBasically if you have a lot of people who are dismissive of something who've only researched that thing at a surface level, while on the other hand, you have another group of people who've done some serious DD on it and are convinced of its potential, then you know that it's a 10X candidate. Especially if that company has a great CEO / management team and work culture to solve what the public think are massive hurdles for the company.\n\nAnyways for me it would be Lemonade. I think what's going on is a textbook example of innovator's dilemma. Lemonade at first entered a very underserved market (renter's insurance) to build brand value and recognition. They're now releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months.\n\nMeanwhile the incumbents have the luxury of a huge customer set but high expectations of yearly sales. They are still relying on a lot of legacy systems and core capabilities (broker based systems, software that's still running on COBOL). Many shareholders still expect yearly dividends. And so on.\n\nOne interesting quote by the CEO of Lemonade “Ironically you have a better chance of creating a product that’s 10x better than 10% better. And in order to do so you have to throw away everything you know and reason from first principles”. Right now lemonade is ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for insurance, and they can give out and process claims in 1/10th the time as traditional insurance.",
