Some of it is.  Google trades at a whopping 37x earnings! But only 24x forward.  And only 15x fwd EV/EBITDA.  That is the metric I will focus on for now as I tend to use DCF models with EV/EBITDA terminal values.  The average EV/EBITDA multiple over the last 10 years is about 16x.  The lowest was 10x and 10x is the lowest it ever traded since IPO.  Using a DCF model and using ultra bear scenario of the following assumptions: 2022-2025 revenue growth of 0% annually (yes, correct),  gross margins of 55% (below the 10 year average of 60%), operating margin of about 23% (10 year average 25%), D&A constant at 8% of revenue, Capex in line with Bloomberg estimates approx 16-17% of revenue, and change in NWC of about -3% (consistent with last 4 years).  WACC is 9.5% and used a 10x exit multiple.  This estimates an intrinsic value of $2068, about -9% from current values.  And that is the bear case with ultra bearish assumptions.\n\nThe base case then with revenue growth of 10%, same margins, higher depreciation based on consensus estimates, and an exit multiple of the 10 year average of 16x yields a price of $4831, upside of 112%.\n\nOf course, I never truly depend on a DCF model to provide an exact price because there are so many assumptions that will never play out as expected, but it is a great tool to identify what factors impact price and some worst case scenarios.  It is further evidence to me that Google is one of the most undervalued large caps with a wide moat around its largest product, expanding its range and interconnectivity of its products constantly, and generating a significant amount of cash in the meantime.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",
