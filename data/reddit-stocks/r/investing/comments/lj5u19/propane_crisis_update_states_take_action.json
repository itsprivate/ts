Since then, a Polar Vortex has arrived across the entire continental US and the shortage has been reported by multiple mainstream outlets over the last 72 hours.   \n\n\nMany states are already acting on the news, declaring states of emergency, issuing executive orders to temporarily suspend legal limitations on the transportation of propane, and issuing alerts to decrease energy consumption because of record breaking demand. This is further exacerbating the existing hoarding crisis.   \n\n\nSuburban Propane (SPH) is the company that stands to benefit the most from this shortage and the resulting news, because they serve the US market exclusively, conduct mostly residential business, and are gaining from the decreased use of small propane tank exchanges in the US.
