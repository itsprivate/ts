I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity.\n\n\nWhen I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money?\n\nDoes it usually take this long?\n\nIf i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years?\n\nIs it legal for them to hold my money for this long?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTD Ameritrade\n\n https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg\n\nI got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK",
