This is working out quite well for me. \n\nBut my wife and I have a dream of an own house with a garden. Prices are hell high at the moment but somehow thats always been the case in the last years. \n\nSo with my income of approx 6k a month and with my 200k I can easily get a credit of 800k to build my dream house. The land we want alone costs about 400k. \n\nBut here is my problem:\nI have to sell all my investments and then pay off a credit. So I will switch from a financial comfortable to a credit situation without any investing. 4 months a year i pay off the interest of the bank and 8 months a year I pay off the credit. \n\nI am 35 now. \n\nBut on the other hand: what am I investing for? To be able to get things i desire and to live a peacefull life without money issues. \n\nBut when is the right point to do this? I somehow feel like staying invested would give me more financial independence. But someday I want to have this dream house. \n\nAnybody who has similar situation or can help me with judgement?",
