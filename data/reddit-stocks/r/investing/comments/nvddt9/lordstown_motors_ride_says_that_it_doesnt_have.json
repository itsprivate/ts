It has said its first model, the Endurance, will start production in September.\n\nLordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns said on a call with analysts in late May that the startup would need to raise more capital to hit its target of building 2,200 pickup trucks by year-end. The company said at the time that higher-than-expected costs were accelerating its cash burn and that it would finish the year with between $50 million and $75 million on hand.\n\nThe company was among a number of new electric-vehicle startups that went public last year through reverse mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Lordstown raised $675 million from its reverse merger last fall, a deal that valued the aspiring truck maker at about $1.6 billion.\n\nThe company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/lordstown-motors-amends-annual-filing-with-going-concern-notice-11623181411",
