All the other companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG) don't have to make a penny from their music streaming services because all of these companies have way more profitable lines of businesses. Besides, music streaming does not have any economy of scale to speak of. The more users you have, the more music is getting streamed, the more royalties you have to pay out.\n\nAny thoughts on why SPOT should have a spot in a stock portfolio?",
