It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC. \n \nShe also reports what an FBI agent told her.\nAccording to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets.\nBTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.\n\nTalking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases.\nSo it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech.\nRegarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction… it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin.\nAnd the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.\n\nCathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation.\nARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other.\nGood vs bad deflation.\nGood deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.\n\n* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.\n* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly.\nAnd according to ARK forecasts… EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.\n\nConcluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:\n\n* Robotics\n* AI\n* Blockchain\n* DNA sequencing\n\nAnd these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect.\nThink about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.\n\nOn the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned.\nThe disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change.\nFinancial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around.\nRay Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.\n\nSo we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.\n\nNote: I’m not a financial advisor\n\nNote 2: If you’d rather listen to than reading this article, you can find the video version on YT at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTOytkHLP4g",
