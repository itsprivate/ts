So I would assume hedge funds could be among the third parties able to borrow the shares, essentially giving them more ammunition to play with messing around with the price! \n\nI’m guessing it’s a strategy to minimise the financial damage to the organisations that are gonna be hit by the short squeezes... What about us retail investors though, how are we gonna be hit by this when the hedge funds have to return the shares, and what if it gets to the point that they can’t return those shares and go bust? I’m curious about that 102% value on the share. Luckily I have majority of my shares in the ISA - which I don’t believe is affected by this.... I know those shares are safe for everyone in invest, but at what return value is what I’m investigating. \n\nI’m new to this, and I might be interpreting this wrong...but this seems to be saying the shares we have in Invest can be lent out to any third parties, and if they can’t pay them back then we are covered up to 102% of the value so the stocks are safe - I’m curious if that’s the value we purchased them at, or the 102% is a value updated on a daily basis on the stocks worth at that time in the market?\n\nHopefully someone more clued up than me can share some thoughts for everyone! Maybe it’s not even a big deal, but I’d be really interested to hearing some of the more experienced peoples thoughts as I’m still learning. \n\n\n* not financial advice, and I am very new to this, just speculation and curiosity, thankyou to all commenters :) *",
