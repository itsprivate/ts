They have 124M shares out. So, at the current quote of slightly above $350, their market cap is $44 Billion\n2. 2020 revenue was $1.778 Billion, up 57.5 % over 2019  \n\n   1. Player (hardware) revenue was $510 M, up 31.6 % YoY (good number)\n   2. Platform revenue was $1.27 B, up 71.1 % YoY (excellent number)\n3. Gross margins were 45.45% up 158 basis points YoY  \n\n   1. Player (HW) margins were 8.55% up 414 bps YoY\n   2. Platform (SW) margins were 60.3% down 413 bps YoY\n4. Number of shares were up 7.6 % YoY\n5. Op-ex was up 47.9 % (S&M 67 %, G&A 48.8 %, R&D 34.25 %), all YoY\n6. They do not use much leverage, current portion of LTD is below $100M\n7. Cash position of a little over a billion dollars\n\nSo,  \"player\" is their foot in the door, but \"platform\" is where they make  money. Most of ROKU's platforms are not in the premium segment, but  found in the value Smart TV segment\n\nROKU's  current market share is a tad shy of 10% of the \\~300M Smart TVs sold in  2020, and ROKU claims a 33% market share in the USA\n\n*I got into this wanting to trash ROKU. Instead, I \"see\" what they are accomplishing,* ***with the exception of earning money (net income)***\n\nValuation Method: Look at HW and SW separately\n\n1. A $510M HW company with a 32 % growth rate, and 8.5% gross margins. Hard to value at over 2x sales. So, let's call it $1 Billion\n2. A  $1.27 Billion SW company with 60% gross margins, and a 71% growth rate.  This is harder to put a firm number on, but anywhere from 10x to 20x  sales. So, $12.7 B to $25 B\n3. Add them up, and I get a range of $14 B to $26 B, or a stock price between $113 to $209\n4. For reference, Morningstar's FVE estimate is $150 with a high degree of uncertainty\n\n**Conclusion: ROKU is seriously overvalued at the current \"depressed\" quote of $350+/share.** *My valuation metrics are \"more than generous\".* ***This is not financial advice***\n\nReference: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k\\_20201231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm)",
