All too often I'll see comments indicating it isn't good \"value\" based on some arbitrary P/E. A company can appear to be more \"expensive\", but still generate better returns than a similar company that trades at a lower P/E, but has inferior returns on invested capital (ROIC). \n\nTwo companies I've been looking at are Home Depot ($HD) and Lowe's ($LOW). Both are excellent companies and both have handily outperformed the market over the last 10 years. \n\n[However, between the two of them, $HD outperformed $LOW because of a better ROIC which translated to a higher earnings growth.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2011&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=2&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=HD&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=LOW&allocation2_2=100)\n\nAt the start of 2011, both companies were trading at a trailing P/E of approx 18 and both are currently trading at a trailing P/E of approx 22.  \n\n**Lowe's**\n\nA $1000, investment in $LOW would be worth $7668. CAGR of 22.18% (very impressive compared to SPY's 13.6%)\n\nEPS grew from $1.42 to $7.10 in that period at a CAGR of approx 17.5% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)\n\n**Home Depot**\n\nA $1000, investment in $HD would be worth $9267. CAGR of 24.48% \n\nEPS grew from $2.01 to $11.57 in that period at a CAGR of approx 19.13% (the rest of the returns can be attributed to P/E expansion)\n\n**The same amount invested in HD resulted in a 20% higher total return over a 10 year period.** \n\nI want to be clear that a high ROIC isn't the be-all and end-all of an investment thesis. The price you pay absolutely matters. But when I screen for stocks, I like to find a company with a solid track record of generating high ROIC over a 10-15 year period. A superior ROIC can be considered a company's \"moat\" as it seems to have some secret sauce that lets it generate profits more efficiently than its peers. A healthy ROIC is indicative of a company that is capable of growing the top line efficiently and/or commands strong margins (both of which translate to EPS growth).\n\n **Keep in mind, when looking at a company's ROIC, you want to measure it with respect to their peers and the company's cost of capital.**  \n\nI'd say my investment strategy is to find high ROIC businesses in sectors I somewhat understand (consumer staples, consumer goods and retail), build a position when the stock is at a price I find appealing and then hold for as long as the company keeps generating high ROICs (however long that may be). There's a few variations to the formula that calculates a company's ROIC, but here's a simple version that works pretty well (assuming you want to calculate it yourself from the financial statements as opposed to looking it up on Morningstar/ValueLine etc)\n\nROIC = Operating Profit/(Total Assets - Current portion of Debt - Cash)\n\nSo for those of you that may be interested in following that investment strategy, here's my watchlist (some of which I own). \n\n**Consumer Staples -** Brown Forman ($BF.A,) Colgate ($CL), Clorox ($CLX), Hershey ($HSY), Coca-Cola ($KO), Altria ($MO), Philip Morris ($PM), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Boston Beer Co ($SAM) and Unilever ($UL).\n\n**Consumer Goods -** Apple ($AAPL), Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) and Nike ($NKE).\n\n**Retail and Restaurants -** Dominos ($DPZ), Home Depot ($HD), McDonalds ($MCD), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Starbucks ($SBUX), Ross Stores ($ROST) and TJX Companies ($TJX).\n\n**Financial Services -** Mastercard ($MA) and S&P Global Inc ($SPGI)\n\n**There's no guarantee that such stocks will always outperform or that they can maintain high ROICs indefinitely.** However, it's a good place to start.\n\n**TLDR:** High ROIC companies generally trade at a premium. This is because they are able to grow earnings faster and/or return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.",
