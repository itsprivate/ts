If you have a disagreement with the mods of WSB then slide in to their DM and let them know (modmail, don't actually DM a mod, that's weird), or go to one of the subreddits like /r/subredditdrama that are dedicated to this sort of dumb shit, but don't post about it here because that'll be immediately removed.\n\nThis subreddit is for discussing investing, not for airing out disagreements with other subreddits.
