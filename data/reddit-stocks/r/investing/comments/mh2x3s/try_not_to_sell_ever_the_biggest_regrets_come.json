It has always, always been selling a stock that I knew was good but I thought had run up over its fair value and sold.\n\nThe market is a mass wealth accumulation machine. If the company is good, even if its value has gone up significantly compared to its cash flows, hold. I always find the solid companies I invest in continue to increase their earnings into the futures and not only grow into their higher evaluations but exceed them in a few years time.\n\nWhatever you do, provided your due diligence and research was good, try not to ever sell. Let that great machine of wealth creation that is the stock market work for you and the companies you invest in. Let it churn, let it grow. Take your hands off the wheel and let your good choices be rewarded with time.\n\nI know this isn't the most quantitative post, but I think it is a good signal to put out there. Don't be afraid to leave your winners be, reinvest your dividends, give your choices time to compound. Be a lazy investor, let your good decisions reward you in abundance and take your hands off the wheel, you'll be all the wealthier for it.",
