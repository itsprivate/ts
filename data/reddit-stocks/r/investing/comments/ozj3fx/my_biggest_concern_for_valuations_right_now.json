Obviously speculation is part of the stock market so one would expect a price to earnings ratio of greater than 12.5 or 8% yearly returns, however, there seems to be too much speculation. I don't think companies are going to become    profitable enough to warrant such a high level of speculation. There is definitely a bubble in many tech stocks in my opinion Tesla being the most extreme example in my opinion has a p/e of 365 and a market cap of nearly 700 billion meaning that they are not only a massive company, but also most likely wildly over valued. The feds ability to do market intervention is declining by the day due to the use of qe and near 0 interest rates. I am concerned about this bubble popping causing a significant loss in confidence which the fed would have a limited ability to react against. Thoughts?",
