There's an obvious flaw here, as the position grows the amount ($20) becomes less and less as a percentage and will have less of an effect over time.\n\nWhat strategy do you use to grow your positions over time and increase the chances of profitability while reducing the chances of making a loss? What rules do you set/stick to?",
