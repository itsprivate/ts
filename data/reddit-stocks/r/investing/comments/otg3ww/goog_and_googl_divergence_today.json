Just doesn't make sense as to why an equivalent share of stock, with the added benefit of voting rights, would trade less than the non-voting shares.  SMH.\n\nBut today's action has me baffled again... Why would GOOGL rise $100/share while GOOG looses a few bucks a share?  Did Alphabet announce a share buy-back for GOOGL and not GOOG, or is there something else I missed?  I read through the earnings coverage, but I did not find mention of this.\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",
