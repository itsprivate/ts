For most people, it's absolutely the best vehicle to use for growth. Max it out each year and don't take any out until retirement.\n\nAs an example, let's say you're 30. You have 30+ years to retirement. If markets behave as they have on average, your portfolio should double more than 4 times over that time. If you were in a traditional IRA, that 1600%+ growth would be taxed at your tax rate in retirement when you take it out with distributions. If you invested in a Roth IRA, all that growth is yours to keep, tax free.\n\nHere's an example using [this calculator](https://www.investingfees.com/calc/investment/).\n\nStart with $10,000. Invest an additional $6,000 each year. Earn 10% each year (a [reasonable](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/) [estimate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return) for long term returns). Repeat for 30 years. At the end of 30 years, you'll have invested $190,000. You'll have accumulated $**1,161,458.16**. If you used a traditional IRA, you would have saved some taxes on that $190,000 you put in, however you'll be paying tax on all the gains when you take the money out. If you used a Roth, you would enjoy that $1,161,458 tax free in retirement. It's worth noting inflation will reduce the buying power of that sweet $1M+...all the more reason to be invested and keep all the growth you can get.\n\nWhere to invest if you're just starting out? I'd suggest Vanguard with a low-cost index ETF like \"VTI.\" Young and/or want to take on more risk in hopes of higher returns? Consider putting a portion in ETF's like VGT, ARKK, QCLN, or any other sectors you think will outperform the market.\n\nHope that helps. Get your kids to start a Roth as soon as they have a job. Compound growth were the first words I tried to teach my kids. I was still happy with \"dada.\"",
