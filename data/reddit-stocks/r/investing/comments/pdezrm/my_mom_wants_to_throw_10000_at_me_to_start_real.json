My Mom, who is very supportive of me, told me my Aunt and Uncle are planning to buy a property up north and said she would gift me, a 20 YO college student, $5,000 - $10,000 to invest with my Aunt and Uncle to start real estate.\n\nMy issue is I just don't know why or if I can accept possibly $10k from my Mom. It seems a bit like a shortcut tbh. If I can, I'd try paying her back at interest or something. Idk, it seems weird for my Mom to throw $10k in my face, even if I invest in it. I don't even know how much of the property I would own or how much rent I would make.\n\nNot to mention, I'm a 20YO with no real estate experience. My mom said I should use this money and my uncle as a mentorship opportunity, but idk. It feels wrong to invest money not made through my own work. I was gonna wait to start working around October (I'm new to my College, so I wanted to know if I could handle the workload).",
