Uber has spent millions battling those challenges in other regions. \n\nIn California, Uber pushed back against Assembly Bill 5, a gig-economy law passed by the state legislature in 2019 that tightened the rules for classifying workers as independent contractors. \n\nAfter a widespread campaign, costing over $200 million — the most expensive ballot measure in the state’s history — Uber and a handful of other gig-economy companies persuaded voters to support a ballot measure called Proposition 22, which exempted Uber and other gig-economy platforms from state employment law.\n\nIn turn, gig workers received some benefits without full employment status. Some of the additional costs of providing benefits were passed on to ride-hailing customers.",
