This is actually a great way of investing praised by some of the best investors. And one I recommend some of my friends an family.\n\nBut my point is, if one has chosen to do this, why on Earth are they still reading r/investing every single day and commenting that quote every minute.\n\nIn my case, the reason why I avoided passive investing was the fact that I love researching and reading about companies, and I don't see myself without doing it.\n\nSo, why do lot passive investors keep reading & commenting all individual stock analysis posts?\n\nPS I'm not a hater, I'm just curious why they do it. IMO they do it because they keep questioning if they really want to stick with passive investing, but I could be wrong.\n\nPS2 sorry I'm advance for my English, it's not my first language :/\n\nHave a great day!",
