Still overvalued in your opinion? Are you waiting until the price drops more?

However I must admit after lots of research Tesla does seem to be 5 years ahead of other EV makers and i’ve been waiting ever since to see a price drop.\n\nDoes this drop in price justify buying a position in Tesla or are you expecting a bigger drop? I personally don’t believe the Model Y news is too shocking, Elon Musk has consistently acknowledged the challenge of mass-scale production.",
