The way it is calculated is by taking the weighted average of all the OTM calls and OTM puts that are being purchased. The demand for OTM puts is what causes the VIX to rise.\n\nWe've also heard and seen that once the stock market reaches complacency, and *everyone* believes that the market is going to only head higher, that is when a bubble can pop.\n\nIf fewer people buy OTM puts, that means that the VIX is lower, which also holds the assumption that everyone is buying into the market, and there is less money on the sideline.\n\nWell, even though we have recovered from the COVID lows, VIX has never closed below 20. Typically, during a calm period in a bull market, VIX tends to stay comfortably below 20,\n\nLet's look at what VIX was before the dotcom crash, banking crash, and the covid crash:\n\n* Dotcom crash = 16.28\n* Banking crash = 18.53\n* Covid crash = 18.84\n\n[https://imgur.com/HBT879v](https://imgur.com/HBT879v)\n\nThose are all the readings the month before the crash.\n\nWith the close of February 2021, the VIX is at 27.95. In January, the VIX closed at 33.09. In other words, the VIX is extremely elevated at the moment, and going back in history, we really haven't seen a full-blown crash while the VIX is already this elevated going into it.\n\nCircling back, this just tells us that throughout the last 6 months, investors have continued to purchase \"insurance\" in the market, and we haven't hit the full-on euphoria that some might believe we have hit.\n\nTo wrap this up, I don't believe that the current drop is the start of a major correction. We would need to see more complacency on a further bull run before we truly see the bubble popping that many of us expect.",
