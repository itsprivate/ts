Feel free to point me to a better fitting sub if you can think of any\n\nSo, I've been working at a mature start up for about a year now. I joined as part of a growth cycle in which about 100 people were hired. My role is compensated well, mostly because I work in tech in a role with a lot of responsibility. I asked when I joined if I could have shares, they said it was in the works and coming to everyone soon. I didn't press too much as I was already receiving a big bump in salary.\n\nRecently all existing employees have been offered Growth shares. The company have made a big deal about not wanting it to be about % stake in the business, or deciding based on salary. Which, if I'm being cynical, seems like that only stands to benefit them by making it harder to understand what you're getting.\n\nDoes anyone have experience receiving growth shares? Typically how many shares would you expect for a company at this stage? The only figure I've been told is based on the company's previous funding round, they were valued at ~$30m, if the company sold for $1B I would be looking at ~$90k return on the sold shares. Am I being unreasonable to think this isn't actually a very meaningful stake given how few startups actually reach that size?\n\nPurely on numbers, I've worked the offer to be ~3.5% of my salary as Growth shares, vested over a 5 year period. Equating to ~0.0008% stakeholder in the business. \n\nSorry for the ramble, Im planning to speak to them about it, but ideally I'd like a number in my head and some evidence of what other companies at this stage have offered in the past.",
