They regularly go private.  It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.

To be completely honest we have been in need of some sort of overhaul in both moderation and rules for some time - the onslaught of frankly very low effort posts over the last few days has only served to expose just how much we rely on users to do the right thing with regard to posting, this isn't the thread for that, and I'm slammed at work, but it's gotta happen at some point.\n\ne3: y'all, 5 people DMd me and 6 others messaged our modmail asking for access to WSB.  That is NOT how reddit works lol.  I do think this is illustrative of how many people have flocked to this sub and this site without understanding any of it recently.\n\ne4: in the last 60 minutes there were 53 new submissions, of those only 4 were actual posts worth making.
