Thus far its been overlooked for bigger players like LOGITECH.\n\n\\- Their Q4 earnings reports are about to release on 2/9. They'll contain holiday season sales. Every related company in that space has been posting record Q4 sales.\n\n\\- IN 2019 they crossed $1bln revenue for the first time. If current revenue trends continue, its going to be approaching $2bln revenue for 2020. By several metrics they're growing FASTER than LOGI, at less than half the price.\n\n\\- Their market cap is currently  **$4.17 Billion ....**  Compare that to LOGI at **$18 Billion.** Despite TTM revenues approaching 50% of LOGI, the market cap is more than 4x lower. If you think LOGI is fairly priced (or under valued), then CRSR has a lot of room to go up.\n\n\\- They have recently been making some big acquisitions throughout 2019 and 2020, notably in the rapidly expanding streaming space where they're building market dominance (Snapping up Elgato was a big one).\n\n\\- Less diluted than LOGI (Looking at RPS, only 38% lower)\n\n\\- It blew past EPS estimates in Q2 and Q3. After Q3 earnings report share price doubled in 2 weeks. I think Q4 EPS estimates are very low. I see it absolutely crushing them.\n\n\\- Net Profit Margins have been increasing every quarter in 2020.  All other fundamentals are on a positive trajectory.... net debt going down, gross margins going up.\n\nBased on the rest of the market, if Q4 revenue are in line with expectations I think share price could easily hit $100 or more by Q2.\n\nThoughts?",
