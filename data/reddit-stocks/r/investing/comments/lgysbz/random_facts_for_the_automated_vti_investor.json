Using Yahoo Finance historical data for VTI over the past 5 years, I ended up answering this question plus diving deeper to make a few other random observations. Here is what I found:\n\n* **What day of the week is best to buy VTI?**\n   * **Thursday**, hands down\n   * Data for average delta of opening vs previous trading day close:\n      * Mon: +0.056016\n      * Tues: +0.228716\n      * Wed: +0.114864\n      * Thurs: -0.05267\n      * Fri: +0.071502\n* **Does the day of the week matter over a long period of time?**\n   * Basically **no** \\-- but if you're going to pick a day for auto-investing, you might as well pick Thurs\n   * I setup my spreadsheet to show the total gains of auto-investing $100/week on a given day. I did not factor in closed trading days + that M1 Finance auto-invest on the next open trading day.  So certain days (Mondays particularly) had significantly less buys than Tues/Wed.\n   * Data for average portfolio size of auto-investing in VTI:\n      * Mon: 236 buys, cost-basis $23.6k, current value $35.7k, gain 51.22%\n      * Tues: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $38.9k, gain 51.33%\n      * Wed: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $39.0k, gain 51.96%\n      * Thurs: 255 buys, cost-basis $25.5k, current value $38.7k, gain 51.93%\n      * Fri: 253 buys, cost-basis $25.3k, current value $38.4k, gain +51.83%\n* **What day of the week saw best overall gains?**\n   * Still **Tuesdays**\n   * Data for average delta of closing vs previous trading day close:\n      * Mon: +0.076398\n      * Tues: +0.160039\n      * Wed: +0.13786\n      * Thurs: +0.00851\n      * Fri: +0.061344\n   * If you compare this data vs the data from bullet #1, we see a few interesting facts:\n      * Mon, Wed, and Thurs will close higher than opening\n      * Tues and Fri we see some profit taking and close slightly lower than opening\n* **What would happen if you just invested the $25.7k from bullet #2 in lump sum at the beginning of the 5 year period?**\n   * Value of your VTI portfolio would be about **$60.5k** right now (or about 55% more)\n* **Lastly... What would happen if you invested in yearly lump sums at the 'worst possible day of the year' (simulating the most unlucky investor ever)?**\n   * I divided the $25.7k into 5 parts and invested $5140 on the worst day of 2016, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The choices of 'worst day' was completely subjective based on eye balling charts when VTI would dip over subsequent days/weeks.\n   * Dates chosen:\n      * 2016 - June 8\n      * 2017 - March 1\n      * 2018 - Sept 20\n      * 2019 - May 3\n      * 2020 - Feb 10\n   * Final account value was **$38.6k**, or roughly the same as weekly auto-investing $100.\n\nEDIT: Typo on the lump sum bullet. Previously said today's portfolio value would be $56.2k. ",
