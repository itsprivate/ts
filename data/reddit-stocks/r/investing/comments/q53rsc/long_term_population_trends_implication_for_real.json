Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. \n\nCan’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. \n\nIf population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand. \n\nAgain not saying this will happen, but personally I feel as though I had not given enough thought to this.",
