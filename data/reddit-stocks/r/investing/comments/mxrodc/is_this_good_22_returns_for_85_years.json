But she did take some risks on smaller names but never a large chunk of her portfolio. She bought a small amount of SHOP when it was $70. AAPL is her biggest holding now and has held some of it since 2012. She didn’t do options, margin, or crypto. Just common.\n\nThe 2x returns over the SP500 is impressive. But I’m more impressed with the 8 years. I know people get lucky buying a stock that becomes a 4 bagger in 6 months. But to consistently get 2x the market returns over 8 years is something.\n\nDo you guys think this is normal? Do many of you have similar returns with similar risk profile? From all I’ve read, is that 80% of individual investors can’t beat the SP500. Is that true or just propaganda by index funds?",
