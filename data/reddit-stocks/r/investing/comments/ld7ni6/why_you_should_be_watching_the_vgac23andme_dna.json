They were founded in 2006 and seems to have a huge market share for d2c DNA testing.**\n\nGoing into the future, I believe that many people will definitely have their DNA sequenced. This is not a fad or a gimmick. Sure, some people might buy a DNA test for novelty purposes to find out their ancestry, but by sequencing your DNA, you would be able to identify a HUGE array of potential health issues. Wanna have a kid? You'd want to know what potential diseases you may pass on. Cancer risk? You can find your risk factor early and keep tabs on it. I am almost certain that doctors will soon recommend this as a standard health practice.\n\nNow on to the quick financials: the merger deal puts the company at a $3.5bn valuation and they'd end up with **$900m in cash.**\n\n**That's a cash ratio of just over 3:1. If that isn't insane value, you tell me what is.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is also worth noting the following:\n\nThey recently entered into a deal with GlaxoSmithKlein for drug development using the gene data from the 10 MILLION users they currently have\n\n* Their app is apparently quite nice to use and miles ahead of the competition. I could envision that in the near future when you open the app you would be able to buy tailor-made supplements to improve your health, specific to your genetics\n* They'd also be able to use your gene data for specific diseases to develop drugs to treat them. H U G E\n* Predictive abilities will improve as their dataset grows. Eg. they have a tool that tells you whether you would get severe symptoms in the event that you do catch COVID-19. This tech will improve and become a necessity to a modern healthcare plan\n* Usually IPOs are first offered to institutional investors, by the time it hits the market, normal retail investors like you and me end up paying the highest prices for the shares.
