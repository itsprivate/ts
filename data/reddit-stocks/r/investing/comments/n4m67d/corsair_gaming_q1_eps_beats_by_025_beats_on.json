End demand remained strong for our products and our new products such as the K65 mini RGB keyboard and Elgato’s new accessories debuted well. We introduced 29 new products in the first quarter and we expect this blistering pace of new product introduction to continue throughout the year with several brand new products still to come. Supplies of key components remain tight but we have been able to support our plans and will continue to work on this issue for the rest of the year. As a result of our stronger-than-expected first quarter performance and our current views for the rest of the year, we raised our 2021 annual guidance,” stated Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of Corsair.",
