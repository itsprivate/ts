Unfortunately, most patients are either not eligible to use IOs or relapse after a couple of years and then go into traditional, more aggressive chemotherapies regimes.\n\nWhen cancer patients are on chemo, they are also medicated with glucocorticoids, which are potent anti-inflammatory molecules. Glucocorticoids suppress the immune system and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a receptor associated with tumor progression. Stress signaling molecules, like cortisol, also activate GR. Therefore, natural stress and anti-inflammatory medications  can work against the standard of care (chemo) in most advanced cancer patient.\n\nCorcept Therapeutics Inc. and ORIC Pharmaceuticals are developing inhibitors of GR. They Are currently running clinical trials of their drug candidates in combination with chemotherapies.

Right now, both companies are running clinical trials on specific cancer types, but their products are potentially useful in many other indications.\n\n**CORT and ORIC at set to disrupts the delivery of chemotherapies**. This is a huge market segment, since almost every cancer patient end up using ‘flawed’ chemotherapy combinations. I believe these two companies are a great investment target.\n\nIn the next few days, Corcept and ORIC are giving public presentations.
