The lowest stock returns among award winners were found in more traditional sectors of the economy: Construction, repair and maintenance (-1.4 percent); oil, gas, energy and utilities (3.9 percent); and insurance (4.4 percent).\n* Consistent with the growing [academic literature](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/satisfied-employees-drive-business-results/) that finds a link between employee culture and business performance, we find that stocks of publicly-traded winners of Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work award historically outperformed the U.S. stock market in most years.\"\n\nWhen it comes to valuing a company, it seems that people tend to just look at balance sheets.
