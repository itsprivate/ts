We all know what’s going on with GME, and yes its a crazy occurrence. The people that are new here may see only the good side of things with how many people are making so much money over night, how people are making so much money off GME. It all seems so easy. I’m here to remind you it’s the exact opposite. Most newbies that join WSB blow up their trading accounts and lose all their money. I am certain many people that are new here will lose lots of their money soon thinking how easy it is to do this. I am posting this to hopefully save some of those people. Never forget the guy who never knew how shorting works earlier in the year, and owed his broker $200,000 overnight. Educate yourselves before even thinking about investing and or trading. This isn’t a game. Trading stocks/options isn’t ever like this. I don’t want anyone to jump into this thinking trading stocks and options is the easiest money you will ever make. It’s not, and if you do enter this game thinking it is easy, the markets WILL humble you. And I am nearly 100% certain, the new people that yolo’d all their money into GME and made some money, will lose it ALL soon. Hopefully I helped some new people out. And please, NEVER invest or trade with money you cannot afford losing. Please think again if you are ready to load up your life savings on GME.",
