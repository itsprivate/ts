The delta of an option ranges in value from 0.0 – 1.00 for calls (0 to -1.00 for puts) and reflects the increase or decrease in the price of the option in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying asset price.  \n Used to measure the change in value of a contract from a $1 change. Also is used to measure the probability of an Option Contract Expiring “ITM” (In-The-Money). For Example, a Delta of 0.40 can be seen as a 40% chance to Expire ITM.\n\nGamma – An option’s Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of its delta. The gamma of an option is expressed as a percentage and reflects the change in the delta in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying stock price.  \n Measures the change in Delta from a 1$ movement in the underlying asset (stock, ETF, things like that). If the underlying moves an additional 1$ Then Delta would equal the Total of Delta + Gamma. After the First Dollar move, any additional moves in the same direction increases the value of Delta by the amount of Gamma.   \n For Example, XYZ 100 12/31/20 Call for $1.00 and has a delta of .50 and a gamma of .05.  \n The price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards so the new price of the contract becomes 1.50.  \n The Price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards again so now we add both Delta AND Gamma to find the new value. (1.00 + 0.50 = 1.50) 1.50 + (.50 + .05) = 2.05 Value now.\n\nTheta – An option’s theta is a measurement of the option’s time decay. The theta measures the rate at which the options lose their value, specifically the time value, as the expiration date draws nearer. Generally expressed as a negative number, the theta of an option reflects the amount by which the option’s value will decrease every day.  \n For example, if your option contract is currently valued at 1.00 and you have a theta of -0.10, you will lose 0.10 worth of value off your contract every day. This number will change drastically throughout the day as will the other Greeks.\n\nVega – An option’s Vega is a measure of the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option price. Specifically, the Vega of an option expresses the change in the price of the option for every 1% change in the underlying volatility.   \n Estimates the change in premium for each 1% change in the Implied Volatility (IV). There will be higher Vega on Contracts with more time. An increase in Vega increases the cost of the contract and vice versa.\n\nRho – Rho measures the change in Interest rates but is rarely used since Interest rates do not move much.  \n \n\nIt is important to remember that these numbers associated with each Greek will likely change constantly throughout the life of the contract. There are other variables to consider like Implied Volatility, Volume, Open Interest, Days to Expiration (dte), the P/c Ratio, upcoming catalysts, and much more.  \n \n\nThis is a very basic run down of the Greeks. You will not learn everything about options overnight. Enjoy!",
