Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. \n\nIt maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. \n\nIn sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult. \n\nSource: [https://latecycle.com/2021/04/04/waste-connections-the-backbone-of-an-infrastructure-economy/](https://latecycle.com/2021/04/04/waste-connections-the-backbone-of-an-infrastructure-economy/)",
