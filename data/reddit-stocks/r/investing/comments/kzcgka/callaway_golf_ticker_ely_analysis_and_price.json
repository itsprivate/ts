For anyone who is familiar with golf or Topgolf's venues, I believe this merger makes ELY's stock very undervalued and I wanted to do some DD and analysis to come up with a reasonable price target. \n\nCallaway is currently projected to do $1.55B in revenue in 2020 with an expected growth rate of 10.5% for future years while Topgolf will do revenues of about $1.1B while experiencing a 30% growth rate since 2017. This 30% growth can continue for many years to come as the company is still rapidly growing and expanding its venues. Also, over half of Topgolf's customers consider themselves non-golfers so this gives Callaway a huge market to bring in new customers to their golf apparel and equipment revenue streams.

I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. **Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85.**\n\nThoughts??",
