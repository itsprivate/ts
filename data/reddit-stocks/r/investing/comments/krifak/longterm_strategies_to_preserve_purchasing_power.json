With a timeframe of 20 years:\n\n- USD might depreciate substantially w.r.t. to EUR, so my hard-earned money might be worth substantially less in my home country.\n\n- Inflation is inevitably going to decrease the value of cash over time.\n\n- New currencies like Bitcoin might devalue traditional fiat currencies. I’m not a fan of crypto-currencies, but the truth is no one knows what the financial landscape is going to look like in a few decades.\n\nMy question is: how do I preserve the purchasing power of my savings in a safe and currency-agnostic way? I’m not after crazy returns, I just want to make sure that my current purchasing power is preserved.\n\nThe same arguments that apply to cash also seem to apply to other investment classes: you can buy real estate, but there may be a housing bubble, you can buy gold, but people may lose interest in it as a hedge.
