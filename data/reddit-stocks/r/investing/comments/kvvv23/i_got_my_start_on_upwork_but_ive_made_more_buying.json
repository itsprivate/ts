I found a few of my biggest clients on the site. I think Upwork has the potential to kill it in the WFH sector in the coming years, simply because they have been so focused on making a platform for large companies to come and find work. I bought the company stock earlier in 2020 (well, I bought at the IPO, sold, and bought again).\n\nThe stock has killed it since then, and I've made more on the investment than I have on the platform (still a top-rated freelancer even though I barely use it).\n\nHOWEVER, I think Upwork's fatal flaw is their inability to keep people from moving off-platform for payments. There is absolutely no way for the company to know if a client or the freelancer move off-site after an initial contract is completed. From what I understand, all communication needs to stay on-site until a contract is started now. Okay, but then you can move off-platform for communication. Then there's the inevitable discussion of \"Hey, do you have PayPal?\" or \"Let's move you onto our company bill-pay system.\" All that has to be done is end the contract as a successful completion on Upwork and they're now separated and working off-site.\n\nThis happens ALL the time, and I can see why. Even PayPal fees are less than UW's percentage, even if it moves into the 10% and 5% range.\n\nOf course, there are the lowest bidders driving down everyone's rates on the site. There are also scammers. I found someone on there using my entire profile bio, word-for-word (reported it, taken down).\n\nEven with their flaws, Upwork stock is surging and has been upgraded by most analysts. Imagine how awesome they'd be if they fixed the issues.",
