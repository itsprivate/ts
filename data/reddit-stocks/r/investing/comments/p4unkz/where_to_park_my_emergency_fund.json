Right now I’m considering parking this into a bond etf in my taxable account so I can get at least 1-2% back each year and so that its accessible (aka not in a retirement account). Savings accounts, CDs, etc. are not options. I’m not unfamiliar with the market so I wont jump at the slightest bit of risk but I would like my money to still be there in an emergency. My goal is just to beat what I would get if I put it into a savings account. Any suggestions on ultra safe securities or alternatives? \n\nThank you!",
