This was a long time coming, unfortunately.\n\nI started trading stocks roughly 10 years ago, when i was in my mid-20's, when Scottrade was still around. I have placed many dumb trades over the last 10 or so years. In addition, I have not learned from my mistakes and I have made some mistakes way more then once. All of this while trading on a margin account, with margin money. That has exacerbated my wins and losses sometimes to $1000's of dollars on a single trade.\n\nReflecting back on the last 10 or so years, it really blows my mind how many trades that i have made where i was on the wrong side of the trade. Its shocking and unbelievable... to say the very least. These losses pertain to stocks that are small cap, large cap.. and even some penny stocks. The level of regret that i have is way more then i could have ever of imagined, when i first started and thought about the risks.\n\nOn the one hand - if i stop investing (gambling) now entirely, I would probably save what little money that i have left in my account. In addition, i would probably save whatever money i can make over the coming days/weeks from being lost as well. However, i would have to come to terms with never recovering all of the money that i lost.\n\nOn the other hand - if i don't stop investing \\*cough\\* gambling.. it gives me hope that I could make back some/all of the money I lost, over the course of time. In a way, the money could be viewed as lost for now, but not forever if that makes sense. However, there is going to be a good chance that i lose more money then i already have.\n\nOverall, all of this eats away at me every single day. Not one day goes by where i dont think about all of the money i have lost in stocks, plus all of the other money additionally that i spent on computer games prior to my mid-20's. It's depressing and every day i have to put a smile on my face around my friends/family like as if \"everything is A-OK\", when in reality - its not. I have roughly 55k in personal debt, with not much money in my trading account as an asset to leverage against it.\n\nTrying to think about any positives about my situation? What comes to my mind is that i have a roof over my head, i have food, I dont owe my stock broker money, although i lost the job that I was once proud of, i have a new \"contractor\" job that requires a lottttt of hours.. but i can make roughly $1,000 a week... and lastly i guess its a good thing that i dont have a girlfriend, wife or kids to support. God knows when i would be able to settle down and start a family one day at the rate i am going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*EDIT: Some of my dumb trades involved:*\n\n1. At times, having a single stock risk associated to my account\n2. Using margin money, and not respecting it\n3. Trading penny stocks (sometimes)\n4. Trading large portions of my money on FDA catalyst events\n5. Trying to time the market by shorting the broader market\n6. Looking up what the biggest percentage gainers/losers are for the day and going either long/short them for a quick day trade by trying to capitalize on the intraday volatility\n7. Not keeping my account hedged at all times\n8. Not capitalizing on the safety of ETF's\n9. Day trading more often then not\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nOne failure of an investor",
