Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)\n\nThe first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.\n\nWhat do you think? How long will this EV mania last?",
