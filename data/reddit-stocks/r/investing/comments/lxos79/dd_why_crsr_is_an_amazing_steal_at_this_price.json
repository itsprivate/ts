Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $191.8 million, an increase of 104.0% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $364.5 million, an increase of 56.8% year-over-year.\n- Gross profit was $153.8 million, an increase of 118.3% year-over-year, with gross margin of 27.6%, an improvement of 600 basis points year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $68.9 million, an increase of 197.7% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $84.9 million, an increase of 79.5% year-over-year.\n- Operating income was $58.9 million, an increase of 314.2% year-over-year.\n- Adjusted operating income was $71.0 million, an increase of 166.9% year-over-year.\n- Net income was $43.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.0 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.08 per diluted share. _ Net revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 55.2% year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $539.4 million, an increase of 83.4% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $1,163.0 million, an increase of 44.8% year-over-year.\n-Gross profit was $465.4 million, an increase of 107.5% year-over-year, with gross margin of 27.3%, an improvement of 690 basis points year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $189.7 million, an increase of 133.2% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $275.7 million, an increase of 92.9% year-over-year.\n\nThey are expecting nearly $2 billion in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $3 billion.\n\nThis is one of the CHEAPEST valuation for a company with this kind of growth. A quick comparison with AMD will reveal 10 times expected revenue in 2021 versus CRSR's 2 times in 2021.\n\nWith yearly revenue being up 58%, there's a lot of reasons why this stock is amazing. So it begs the questions:\n\nIf the stock is amazing, both from a growth perspective and a book value perspective, why is it going down?\n\nYou guessed it - short sellers\n\n**SHORT INTERESTS**\n\nCRSR has one of the HIGHEST short interests in the market (on top of the other wonderful stocks mentioned in this subreddit). The S/I from january to february increased a whopping +63.8% (see https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/) to 5+million shares from 3 million.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why this might be. But If I had to guess, it's because the shorts saw an easy way to manipulate the price down whilst there's no news going on. With all the other hype going on with other tickers, they saw CRSR as an easy target as earnings is a few months away and it's not currently a big news stock\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $33 at the time of writing, way down from its $47 high DESPITE having killer earnings and guidance. Most analyst have their price target at an average of $49 (See here: https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crsr/forecast)\n\n**This leads to one of the biggest opportunities I can think of, both for a short squeeze and a buying opportunity for an excellent company at this price point.**\n\nSources:\n\n- https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/\n- https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr\n- https://theenterpriseleader.com/2021/02/19/brokerages-anticipate-corsair-gaming-inc-nasdaqcrsr-will-announce-quarterly-sales-of-444-82-million.html\n- https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-content-design-corsair-acquires-140000904.html\n- https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/price_to_book_value\n- https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/debt_equity_ratio\n-https://www.finscreener.org/title/key-ratio-history?kpidcp=58766&kpi=5&idcp=58766#:~:text=(CRSR)%20is%203.00\n- https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/\n\nDisclosure: I'm not a financial advisor.
