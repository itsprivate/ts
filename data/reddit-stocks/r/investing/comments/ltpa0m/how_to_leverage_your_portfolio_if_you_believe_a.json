Does it make sense? Of course, valuations at an all time high and some companies are definitely profiting more then ever, but many are not.\n\nNow for the stocks I own, I am definitely a long term holder. This past week my portfolio would’ve dropped roughly 5% or so had I not leveraged it with (Sqqq) calls.\n\nSQQQ is essentially suppose to be a 3x mirror inverse of the NASDAQ, which are a lot of the crazy ballooned tech companies. So food for thought for any of you guys, if you think a crash is coming maybe leverage it with some sort of put action.\n\nWhat I would NOT do - do not sell your long term stocks if a drop starts coming because you’ll inevitably sell at the wrong time and we don’t know when/if the market is going to crash. I just happen to think it is sooner rather than later, or at least a solid 10-20% correction.\n\nDisclaimer - I’m not a financial advisor but sharing my thoughts on the immediate future.",
