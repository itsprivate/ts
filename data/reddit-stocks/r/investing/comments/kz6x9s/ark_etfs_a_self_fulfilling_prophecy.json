After the trade notification report of ARKW's 497k shares purchase in PLTR was released after trading hours, reddit/stocktwit community immediately started to share about the news and it further amplified the news to a huge extent, where it popped 11% the next day after opening before inching back down.\n\nOr another one would be the recent announcement to start a ARK Space ETF - and space related stocks were soaring on the very next day.\n\nThis phenomenon almost seems like the Midas Touch, where she has the ability to touch (or invest) anything into gold due to her almighty influence. Honestly, the best play I would reckon would be just to invest in her ETFs given the self-fulfilling nature and you never know when she will dump the stock (since a sell-off will inevitably follow thereafter).\n\nAny thoughts about this?",
