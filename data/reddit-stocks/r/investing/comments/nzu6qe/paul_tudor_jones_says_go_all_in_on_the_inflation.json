I’d probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold,” added Jones, who called the stock market crash in 1987 and is founder and chief investment officer of [Tudor Investment](https://www.tudor.com/default.aspx#section-About).\n\nOn the other hand, Jones predicted that markets would be unsettled if the Fed comes out with a different tone Wednesday.\n\n“If they course correct, if they say, ‘We’ve got incoming data, we’ve accomplished our mission or we’re on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,’ then you’re going to get a taper tantrum,” Jones said. “You’re going to get a sell-off in fixed income. You’re going to get a correction in stocks. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s over.”\n\nThe Fed’s two-day policy meeting is [scheduled to conclude Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/markets-await-the-feds-meeting-in-the-week-ahead.html), and Chairman Jerome Powell is set to hold a news conference after the central bank releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nPowell and company have maintained their highly accommodative monetary policy approach, which was instituted in response to [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). Central bankers have been steadfast [despite criticism](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html) that massive bond buying and near-zero interest rates are no longer necessary because the economic recovery is well underway and inflation data is concerning. \n\nPowell and other Fed officials say they believe rising prices are likely temporary as the economy reopens from all manner of pandemic-related disruptions, which in turn justifies their policy stance.\n\n“The idea that inflation is transitory, to me ... that one just doesn’t work the way I see the world,” said Jones, who added he feels the central bank’s inflation views [put its credibility at risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-the-feds-credibility-is-at-risk-with-inflation-view.html).\n\nIn Monday’s “Squawk Box” interview, Jones also reiterated his [favorable outlook on bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-likes-bitcoin-calls-it-a-great-portfolio-diversifier-to-protect-his-wealth-over-time.html), calling it a “portfolio diversifier” and a ” story of wealth.” The longtime trader added that[ he’s grown nervous](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/tudor-jones-says-a-stock-market-valuation-making-him-nervous.html) when considering the stock market’s valuation compared with the overall economy.\n\n“The only thing I know for certain, I want 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities. At this point in time, I don’t know what I want to do with the other 80% until I see what the Fed is going to do,” Jones said.",
