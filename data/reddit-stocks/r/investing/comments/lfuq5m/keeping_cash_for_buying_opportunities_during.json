Or is it better to increase the monthly dollar cost averaging amount invested and only keep in cash what you actually need in regular savings? Does keeping cash like that hurt you overtime (i.e opportunity cost of keeping cash)? Advice is appreciated! Also, side note, what is a healthy amount to keep in savings/cash for a rainy day (in terms of either salary or expenses) in your opinion?",
