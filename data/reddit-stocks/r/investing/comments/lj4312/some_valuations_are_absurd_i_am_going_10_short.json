It posted record revenues of $20bn, record net income of $8bn, and soared to a market cap of $615bn.**\n\n**With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.**\n\nI believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.\n\nFor this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to **110% long and -10% short** with some select picks.\n\nI will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.\n\n**I'd love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.**\n\n---\n\nMy picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):\n\n**1. TSLA** Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.\n\n**2. SHOP** $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?\n\n**3. UBER** $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.\n\n**4. ZM** $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.\n\n**5. SNOW** $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)\n\n**6. DASH** $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren't the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.\n\n**7. LMND** $10bn market cap for a \"tech\" insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their \"chatbot AI\" on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?\n\n--- \nPicks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.\n\n**8. ABNB** $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.\n\n**9. NIO** $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...\n\n**10. SPCE** $13bn valuation. Richard Branson's pet project run rampant with a Chamath SPAC. Space, very cool. Return on investment is where sorry?",
