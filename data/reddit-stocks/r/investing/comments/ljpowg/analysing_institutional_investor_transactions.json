For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. \n\nWhat I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. \n\nDoes someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.\n\nIn case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:\n[Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_KtPGGTEk)",
