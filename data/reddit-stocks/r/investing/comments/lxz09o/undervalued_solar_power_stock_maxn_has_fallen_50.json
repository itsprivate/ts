They make the highest efficiency and lowest degrading solar panels in the world, and are looking to move into the microinverters, energy storage and even services industries in the next few years with a partnership with Enphase Energy. \n\nAs well as this i believe their core panel production business will continue to expand rapidly as it has done, with a CAGR of 28.1% compared to industry’s 19.5%. \n\nBeing in such a quickly growing industry, and the leader in quality, you’d expect them to have a much higher market cap. This is due to them making a loss the past few years, but i believe they’ll soon swing to profitability and see a massive increase in stock price when that happens. \n\nIf you don’t like investing in currently unprofitable companies, try Canadian Solar $CSIQ and JinkoSolar JKS. Both down 45% ish and with low P/e ratios.\n\nPersonally, i’ll be splitting my money relatively evenly between the three to hedge my bets and capitalise on the rapid growth of solar globally regardless.",
