When meme stocks blew up (BB, AMC, NOK, and GME or BANG) I jumped on the bandwagon thinking it's a fast way to make gains overnight instead of waiting for a company to grow organically. I spent 80% of what I have to my name and bought out shares of BANG, unfortunately, I have now lost 75% of my initial investment. Really expensive lesson but now I've learned and will grow from this and come back stronger. Luckily, I made a deal with my mom when I started university so I don't have any bills to pay other than phone bill, gym membership, netflix, spotify etc. Just the basic stuff so I can still live off of what I left myself with for at least a few months. I'm also in the last semester for a Computer Information System degree so I'm hoping that I can get a job and get back what I lost. I will be holding my meme stocks until I die as a reminder of my very expensive mistake. If they go up great, if not it's no big deal as I have come to finally accept that I lost. Just something I wanna get out of my chest to be at peace with myself.",
