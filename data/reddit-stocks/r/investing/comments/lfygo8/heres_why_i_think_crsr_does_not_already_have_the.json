Yes, I know, its coming off a bull run so must be ready for the 2021 IV crush right?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nAs someone said better than I last week TL;DR... Corsair has already teased their full 2020 earnings in a prospectus a couple of weeks ago on 1/21. We already know they're ending with an incredible year. Better yet, the institutional traders have their heads in the sand on it. [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33)\n\nSince that announcement, the stock has increased **27%**. Earnings surprise must be priced in right? I doubt it\n\nLooking at LOGI, the closest competitor. We saw a big dip starting 1/15 (day before earnings announcement), and on 1/18, day of ER). Standard 2021 post-earnings IV crush.... Right before it ran to ATH 2 weeks later.\n\nNow looking at CRSR vs Logi movements [https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB](https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB) CRSR had a big drop around the same time too. But why? They didnt' release earnings. No major news. No IV crush?\n\n**On 1/13/21, Corsair dropped from the sky, on the same day $G M E started its short squeeze and jumped 57% in a day.**\n\nMaybe a coincidence. Or maybe the 1/13 squeeze wasn't a price correction, it was direct a reaction to the squeeze and overall market pullback. Hedge funds moving money around.\n\n Oh yea, guess who owns 2% of the outstanding float of CRSR? The kings of Squeeze themselves, Citadel [https://imgur.com/xlQNZy](https://imgur.com/xlQNZyJ) \n\nThen price began to recover to normal, until 1/27 and they announced a secondary PO.... price drops again.\n\nAnd THEN we run to $46-$47...27% gain from the post-drop low of $36.\n\n**BUT, we are only 7% up from the recent high trading averages of $41, and still 9% below the ATH.**\n\nThis doesn't sound like its overpriced at all. Sounds like the recent high IVs are result of the price normalization, not over-buying.\n\n**TL;DR:** I think the IV crush or post-earnings selloff is going to be mild, and a precursor to a very fast bounce-back bull run to ATHs",
