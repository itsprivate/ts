They own the [Fruta Del Norte](https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/) gold mine, and while there was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, they managed to have a production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.\n\n[Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) ([CNL](https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/TSXV-CNL/?utm_campaign=single-quote&utm_medium=widget_new&utm_source=collectivemining.com)) who recently released results on about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling that they started drilling a few weeks ago. It is expected that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than their previous discovery. They are showing a lot of potential as the drillings continue. One more good thing about them is that their cash burn is also impressively low.\n\nI feel like mining stocks would be a good option to diversify my assets and investments, but I’m still looking into what to invest on.
