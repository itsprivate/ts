She has overseen the successful IPO of 2U Inc (NASDAQ: TWOU) and her presence in the company appears to give some valid legitimacy. However, she has only been with Darktrace since February 2020 so make of that what you will.\n\n**Jack Stockdale - Chief Technology Officer** Stockdale has held a position of Technical Director at Autonomy. Also [mentioned to be a co-founder of Darktrace by Gustaffson](https://youtu.be/USHgnyIGAXI?t=280)\n\n**Eloy Avila - Chief Technology Officer** Avila has held extensive posts at Autonomy from 2004 - 2014.\n\n**Nicole Eagan - Chief Strategy Officer, AI Officer** (Previously Co-CEO w Gustafsson) Eagan was Chief Marketing Officer at Autonomy between 2005 - 2012.\n\n**Emily Orton - Chief Marketing Officer** Previously EU Marketing Manager at Autonomy\n\n**Nick Trim - Chief Revenue Officer** Trim is another executive who does not appear to have held any positions at Autonomy, although he does have strong connections with intelligence agencies and has been with Darktrace since the early days of the company and was [mentioned to be a co-founder by Gustaffson](https://youtu.be/USHgnyIGAXI?t=280).\n\n**Mike Beck - Global CISO** No apparent connections to Autonomy, has been with Darktrace since 2014 and has strong connections with the UK Government.\n\n**Dave Palmer - Director of Technology** Again no apparent connections to Autonomy, has been with Darktrace since 2013 and has strong connections with the UK Government.\n\n**Al Martin - SVP, Customer Success** Little public information of interest to be found in my quick search.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo add to all this one multiple others who were directly responsible for the HP Autonomy scandal including Mike Lynch and Steve Chamberlain (both have been criminally charged for fraud) have a MAJOR influence in Darktrace to this day with Mike Lynch’s venture capital firm Invoke Capital being the first and biggest investor in Darktrace along with Chamberlain holding the position of Operations Manager at Darktrace.\n\nIn conclusion; all this puts some serious red flags for me on a company I initially had a very positive outlook on. HP Autonomy was involved in one of the largest accounting fraud cases and much of the individuals behind Autonomy are the same ones behind Darktrace with a few others mixed in.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA few articles of interest on this subject which has been covered a fair amount:\n\nForbes: Skeletons In The Closet: $2 Billion Cybersecurity Firm Darktrace Haunted By Characters From HP’s Failed Autonomy Deal\n\nBuisness Insider: Meet the power players at $1.7 billion cybersecurity giant Darktrace, which is thought to be preparing to IPO\n\nSky News: Goldman snubs £2bn Darktrace float amid Lynch extradition battle",
