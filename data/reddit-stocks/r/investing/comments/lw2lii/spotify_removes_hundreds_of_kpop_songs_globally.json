In 2019, BTS was the first group from Asia to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. And, as of February 2020, the boy band reached a new milestone: more than 8 billion streams (8 billion streams!) on the platform.\n\nIf a resolution can't be reached I think Spotify will be in trouble long-term as whatever service picks it up will siphon a significant chunk of users.",
