This is the part where I’m confused. I understand that trailing stop loss follows price increases and stops when price decreases. So what would my stop loss be if I have 20,30,40% profit?\n\nRight now one of my trade has a 20% profit. I set the stop loss at break even + 5%. Giving the trade a 15% wiggle room, is this too much room? The stock exchange I use has a 7% limit fluctuations for every stock meaning it cannot go below 7% any given day.\n\nThanks for your input!",
