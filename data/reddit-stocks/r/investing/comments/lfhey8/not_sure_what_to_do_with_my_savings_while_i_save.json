I currently have about 30k (16k in an RH account and 14k in savings) and am saving around \\~1800 a month. This does not include my 6 month emergency savings.\n\nIn November I took $4500 and opened an ~~IRA~~ broker account with RH as my \"gambling\" account. It was money that I wanted to learn with and could afford to lose. I figured any extra earnings would go towards my house fund. That $4500 is now $16000 (everyones a genius in a bull market). So $4500 was money I could afford to lose but $16000 isn't.\n\nI'm not sure what to do from here. The options I'm considering:\n\n1. Pull out the 10k and put it in a savings account with my other 14k. I heard that you shouldn't invest money you plan on using within a year. It might take a little longer than a year for me to buy a house though.\n2. Invest the 10k into an index fund and keep the other 4.5k in high risk stocks like my original setup.\n3. Take 5k into savings and keep the other 5k in the account to invest in stocks/index funds\n4. Let it ride (JK, not doing this)\n\nI'm currently 30 years old if that makes a difference. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Just realized IRA was not the term I should've been using. It's a regular, not tax advantaged broker account with robinhood.",
