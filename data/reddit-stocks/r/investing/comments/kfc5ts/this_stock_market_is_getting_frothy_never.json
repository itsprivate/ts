It's days like today where we continue to see the stimulus bill get steadily price in and once the gavel hits in Washington I suspect much of it will already be reflected in the market. Now the one thing that could bolster this rally forward is additional positive vaccine news, whether that be improved distribution or another candidate coming forward with an additional vaccine. My top 5 holdings are Shopify, Salesforce, Pinterest, Apple, and Nvidia so I am not feeling guilty shaving profits off the top, albeit gently. I continue to remain a very longer term investor and am always hesitate to sell but raising 5-10% cash is what's called risk management, the market doesn't always go up. I'm always risk on but you'll never make money if you don't take profits and have cash on hand waiting for that market correction. I never claim or try to time market moves but we should all live by the philosophy of buy low and sell high, and right now we are high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeacow",
