Since I'm a data nerd I track any that I can and analyze their hit rate, profitability, etc. I was using Unbias very successfully and making good money until it stopped updating ([see original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then I have been tracking 3 scrapers and 1 methodology I saw here:\n\n* [Millenial Bets](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/user/theindulgery)\n* [Hype Rider](https://hype-rider.com/reddit)\n* [Dayminer](https://dayminer.herokuapp.com/)\n* [Using Finviz to see if buying the biggest losers of the day and selling the next morning for a 1% profit would work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBbawSwzpei5Q93Erg26Ii8JADFryoM2smpNTx5F9aM/edit#gid=910606400)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fair warning:** Google Sheets struggles with large amounts of data and a lot of people logging in, so I created multiples of each spreadsheet. If you have trouble getting in all I can recommend is continuing to try. If you do, make a copy for yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summaries:**\n\n* **Easiest to gather data: Millenial Bets**. This is a straight copy/paste. The others required a lot of Excel copy, pasting, sorting, etc to get it to fit into the sheets\n* **Best average returns: Millenial Bets.** This may be because they had the biggest quantity of results. It's hard to narrow this down to just a few tickers to buy, so looks good as a paper trader but hard to put into use in the real world\n* **Best at returning a small list of tickers to buy: Dayminer.** This data narrows down to just a few, or sometimes none, per day. But the ones that do hit tend to hit pretty consistently\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**End Results from tracking the data:** *(When paper trading I chose categories that had a % of Profitable vs Non-Profitable returns of greater than 90%. I was aiming for highest success rate of being profitable)*\n\n* **Millenial Bets:** \n   * **Total data points:** 5573\n   * **Number of paper trades:** 2212\n   * **% return (avg):** 11.44%\n   * **% return (max):** 50%\n   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 6  \n\n* **Hype Rider:** \n   * **Total data points:** 5425\n   * **Number of paper trades:** 714\n   * **% return (avg):** 7.03%\n   * **% return (max): 13.19**%\n   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 4  \n\n* **Dayminer:** \n   * **Total data points:** 5111\n   * **Number of paper trades:** 278\n   * **% return (avg):** 8.67%\n   * **% return (max):** 29.77%\n   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I use this data?** This is the question I get asked the most often. Here's what I do:\n\n1. Every morning before market open I copy the data from the scrapers, do whatever post-processing I need to do to get it to fit into the sheets, then paste into the sheets. This captures all the sentiment data from the last 24 hours\n2. When I'm ready to buy something I look at the highest profitability categories in the data crunching tabs\n3. From there I narrow down THAT DAY'S list of tickers based on the highest profitability categories\n4. I'll do a quick search on Reddit to see if overall sentiment is bullish or bearish. If everyone looks hopeful I'll buy\n5. I look at the average % returns and the average number of days to get there and those are my exit points  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the good stuff.
