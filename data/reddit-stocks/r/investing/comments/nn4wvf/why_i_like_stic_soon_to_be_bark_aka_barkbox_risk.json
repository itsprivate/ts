The Ticker $stic will be $bark on June 2nd.\n\nMany of these subscription box companies get a bad reputation because there were so many grocery ones that lose billions for years and the pet ones made no money because all they did was get existing products and package them where the margins were horrible. \n\nNevertheless, barkbox is different. They own all of the products they put in the box, we call that vertically integrated. Have a retail store and sell the products at target and other online and offline stores. So, given the higher Margins, vertical integration, new revenue channels and fast growth I think the valuation should be more expensive than chewy on a price to sales multiple. Lets not discount that the subscription model will evolve over time churn is around 5% to 6% which is excellent. \n\nThe company actually has a few revenue channels: \n\nbuy subscription (you can customize as well), \n\nadd on products to the box, \n\ndental (medical and preventative is new and will grow), \n\nmeal plan (sends you monthly box of daily meals; crazy but people/dogs can be picky about food), \n\necommerce/retail where they sell the products on amazon, pet stores etc. this is an interesting business because it is not just ecommerce or subscription because they own a lot of the products they sell as their brand where they have exclusive supplychain and distribution agreements. They also have licensing with plush toys with NBA (example). They realized customers are crazy and treat dogs like people so do stuff accordingly. \n\nNo doubt they will sell clothes, costumers, more medical stuff like fleak tick products to help keep the customes within the ecosystem. \n\nThe ceo is actually new started in september 2020 and has options priced at $16 a share. He came from amazon and ebay and before that consultant at infosys. I think the management hire was an excellent decision as it allows then to scale their ecommerce business and get new customers into the ecosystem via subscriptions or not. I see the subscription revenue as potentially amazon prime stuff where people will just fill it up with what they need and not just junk all the time and people will be happy with that and some add-ons here and there. \n\nThe pet business is a fantastic long-term business as boomers age, etc. strategy for this is to buy and either hold or sell when it hits $20 to $30 if there becomes too much hype. This range of valuation is based in Price to Sales. The bottom I used was 2 times given Its growth rate and almost double the gross margin of chewy and even pet supermarket stores. The guidance for this year has room for upside \n\nI built a ten year model and see then becoming profitable by 2023, however, all of their cash flow is going into growing the business as I think they can sustain a 30% revenue per year for a few years. I do think there are some potential risks such that the Barkeats business could do poorly if the pricing is not competitive or people change the product mix of the box to less profitable products or cancel all together. \n\nInterested in hearing your thoughts on this below.",
