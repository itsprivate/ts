I'm not saying that she isn't a great stock picker or anything about her ability to pick up on trends. You need to make sure that your time frame matches hers. Her time frame is 5-10 years. What we are seeing is not anything new.  It has happened many times in history.  I know what you're thinking, this is different. Do some research on the Munder Net Net Fund. I'm not saying that she can't get great returns or beat the S&P 500 over time, but you need to manage your expectations and strap in for some serious volatility and drawdowns.",
