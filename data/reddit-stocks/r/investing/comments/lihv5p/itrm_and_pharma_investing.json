Only foolish because I bought it without knowing anything about the stock and just saw some conversation about it on stocktwits.\n\nWell, since then it has gone down, so I decided to learn about what it actually is and if I should be patient or cut my losses. I have learned some about FDA approval processes, offerings, urinary tract infections, and that drug companies can exist for some time hemorrhaging money without ever having released a drug before! I found this all to be very interesting! I'd like to share the basics of what I learned, and also get opinions on this stock....\n\nThe company as mentioned, is a \"clinical-stage pharmaceutical company\", which I take to basically mean they have no approved drugs yet. My friend called it a gofundme for drugs when I explained it to him lol. They have been working on one drug, oral antibiotics for treating UTIs, which currently does not exist.\n\nThey have complete phase 3 (of which there are 4 phases) trials with good results and have applied with the FDA for approval(NDA). Approval for this drug is on FDAs \"priority list\", meaning if approved it is somewhat fast-tracked through the approval process. Expected approval is July of this year.\n\nFrom my research I gather that the majority of drugs that pass phase 3 and apply for NDA are eventually approved. Something like over 80%. The company has also recently made a public offering of almost 2 million shares to raise capital that will cover operating expenses until 2023 (that happened a few days ago). They also recently created an agreement with a firm that specializes in assisting drug companies in the final phases of development to bring the drug to market(also very recent activity).\n\nThe stock price has really only gone down since the IPO and is currently at almost an all time low.\n\nTo me, it seems like the approval of this drug is imminent. Why would they be partnering with a company to hash out the logistics of the release if this weren't the case? Why would they still be raising capital if this were not the case? I have a strong sense that the drug will be approved.\n\nAre there any experienced pharma investors here that can chime in on this or give their thoughts?\n\nDoes it follow that if the drug is approved the price will go up as I predict? Or is the price built in?\n\nI think there is still quite some dd to do on this such as what would the drug cost and how many people need it, what is the competition, etc. Starting to look into these things but it gets pretty complicated.\n\nStill a lot to learn but I feel good about this investment after my initial blindfolded dart throw.\n\nThanks for reading.",
