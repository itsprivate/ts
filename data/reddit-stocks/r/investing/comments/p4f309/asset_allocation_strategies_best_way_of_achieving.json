The basic strategy I recommend could be used for any other asset ratio that has to be achieved by some age.\n\n# Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio at 60 year old?\n\n### OPTION 1: Buying/selling to rebalance towards “age minus 20 in bonds” ratio\n\nThis strategy involves selling/buying yearly to rebalance to “*Age minus 20 in bonds.*”, and for the upcoming year buy equity/bonds in that ratio.\n\n**Age minus 20 in bonds:**\n\n* 20-year-olds should have 0% bonds\n* 30-year-olds should have 10% bonds\n* 40-year-olds should have 20% bonds\n* 60-year olds should have 40%.bonds\n\nSo you end up with 60% equity and 40% bonds at 60-year-old.\n\n### OPTION 2: Only buy 100% equity and later only buy 100% bonds\n\nWith this strategy you start by ONLY buying 100% equity, and then based on your expected earnings and the expected return for equity/bonds, you pick an age where you start buying 100% bonds, in the hopes of achieving a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60!\n\nI know that it’s a lot harder to hit a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60 using this strategy, but isn’t it superior in terms of return if you manage to do it? (because equity has higher expected returns and you hold it for a longer time with this strategy)\n\nAlso, this strategy has lower transaction fee’s, because you don’t ever sell to rebalance.\n\n# My questions:\n\n* Which of these 2 options for asset allocation to achieve a 60/40 equity/bond allocation by age 60 do you find optimal?\n* Do you think some other strategy is better?\n* What should I search for when researching this problem? Can you recommend any good papers talking about this?",
