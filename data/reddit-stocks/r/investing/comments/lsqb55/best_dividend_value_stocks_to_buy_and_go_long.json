Boring company but can easily pay out dividends for the foreseeable future presumably. Modest  dividend of about 2%. \n\nTDS: Telephone and Data Systems. The own the majority of US cellular.

I’m bullish especially with 5G emerging. \n\nED: Consolidated Edison. Typical boring utility stock. But the sector is arguably one of the ‘safest.’ Most of the sector is still pretty fairly priced. But ED has gotten beat up lately and they seem much too cheap. And they have a solid 4.5% or so dividend. \n\nPBI: Pitney Bowes. I’m getting really close to buying into this company. I’m just waiting for a bit of a price cool off. (Hopefully.) pretty small company but they deal with shipping/packaging services and general e-commerce stuff. Considering shipping needs seem to be increasing they seem to be a good pick. Plus they seem to have a descent relationship with the USPS as a supplier. And have roughly a 2.3% dividend\n\nThese are a few I’m looking at or have bought. I’m interested in what you guys think and which buried, tucked away value dividend stocks you’re looking at that are trading at juicy prices.",
