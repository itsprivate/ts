Every now and again you hear of someone succeeding but far more fail. \n\nAs I've got older and more experienced I feel like I've gone from the risk taker to the solid investor but now I'm thinking why not have a hybrid strategy depending on your investment goals? \n\nAfter all emotion can mess up even the most solid investors. The dot com crash, 2008 and March 2020 when plenty of people who had been investing for years cashed out their shares at a huge loss.  \n\nI was aware of bitcoin from about 2011. I always knew it was massively volatile so I avoided it and stuck to investing in good old solid returns. But (and I'm sure other people have thought this) why didn't I just put a few hundred dollars in and forget about it? That one 100 bagger can eclipse all the returns of my solid investments.\n\nNow there's NFT's, meme stocks and no doubt there will be plenty of other latest fads. \n\nIt's not for everyone but I have decided to invest a minimum of 5% and never more than 10% of my net wealth into highly speculative, possibly go to zero investments. By always sticking to these percentages I figure if I do catch the next bitcoin ten years away then it's worth the risk. If not then I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. \n\nBut I am losing sleep over missing the next thing that I watch rise over the space of a decade. \n\nWhat amount do you invest in truly high risk, speculative plays?",
