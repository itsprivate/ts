It works the same as supply and demand, if no one wants bonds then the yield rates go up to entice investors in to get a higher return and vice versa if everyone wants bonds they go down as they have all the investors they need so why pay them more.\n\nWe have been in very hot market before this selloff with very low interest 1% rates (bond yield rates and interest rates are similarly correlated also), this has been because the fed has been capping rates and printing like crazy to prop up the economy. So the average bond investor has been thinking why buy bonds when i can have my money in the stock market and get returns of much more then 1% yield. (If adjusted for inflation your actually getting negative returns)\n\nProblem is bonds is government debt which has inflated loads due to stimulus etc and the government needs people to buy these bonds to raise money, they had the worst bond auction not that long ago which meant no one is buying bond at all!! So what happens, the bond yields rose sharply as no one is buying them, to encourage investors in. There are other reasons for investors not buying bonds, such as additional stimulus, this will increase the debt by even more so bond investors are thinking they will get a better deal if they hold off for even longer for yield rates to increase.\n\nSo what happens if no one buys bonds, the government steps in and just prints more money and buy these bonds themselves which is creating this inflation scaremongering also.\n\nThe bond yield of 1.5% is benchmark apparently, if it rises sharply from that it normally causes a negative effect in the growth markets (double check the 1.5% rate). However the government is committed to keeping rates down, so they can cap the rates and just keep printing money to pay their debts. However one day this will end and rates will rise.\n\nThis bond stuff is theoretical thinking, i cant believe everyone is selling their tech & growth stocks to buy bonds atm. i reckon people are just trimming down their positions and being cash heavy which is accelerating this sell off. When markets start selling off also people start moving their money out of hedge funds and asking them to 'hedge' against this downturn which in turns causes them to liquidate their positions adding to the red in the markets.\n\nEdit: this is a simple explanation into bonds and the markets, bonds are complicated and there are many different types. But essentially interest rates are from the bond yield curves and if the bond yields go up then interest rates go up too. High interest rates hampers growth potential of high companies as it costs more to borrow money.",
