Not sure how many people are familiar with the psychedelic space, but I’m here to tell you guys a bit about mindmed and the space as a whole. \n\nThe basic investment thesis is this: current available mental health treatments such as adderall, Xanax, suboxone, etc simply dull out, or put a temporary bandaid on the issue. After looking at the efficacy rates for issues such as smoking cessation, PTSD, treatment resistant depression, etc, it is clear that psychedelics could turn into a massive industry that disrupts the way we treat mental health. This could lead mind medicine and other similar companies to multi billion dollar buyouts from big pharma companies. \n\nThere are plenty of fantastic companies in the space, but mindmed is by far my favourite. For full disclosure I’m currently long ~100k warrants, already up bigly. \n\nMindmed has a diverse pipeline for a multitude of issues, plenty of cash for future R&D, and plenty of fantastic partnerships in academia/pharma. Additionally, this stock cannot be traded yet by anyone on robinhood due to it being on the OTC market. A nasdaq uplist (expected) would open the floodgates to a ton of new retail buyers. There is also EXTREMELY low institutional ownership, basically 0%. \n\nAt a market cap of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, this can easily be a 10 bagger once there is more media attention surrounding it, and more progress is made regarding clinical trials. People are not talking about the psychedelic space yet. \n\nLast thing before I start seeing this in the comments, this does NOT at all compare to the weed industry. There are far more barriers to entry, addresses a totally different market (recreational vs medicinal), and has the added advantage of interest from big pharma.\n\nI’m aware this isn’t very detailed or anything, I don’t have the patience to put together a full DD post. I’m simply encouraging everyone in this group to do consider what this company has going for it.",
