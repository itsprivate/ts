I have medical debt but I payed off all the other debt I had. Stimulus checks for the win. I put 5% of my pay into my 401k which is matched by my company. I am buying some silver every month. I have 1000 in my savings account and 1000 in my checking. I would like to understand money better, I need to get debt free I know, however it will take years to pay off and I'm about to except more debt because I have to have surgery again. Should I just keep up what I am doing or are there other ways to try and grow my money? Are there books I can read?",
