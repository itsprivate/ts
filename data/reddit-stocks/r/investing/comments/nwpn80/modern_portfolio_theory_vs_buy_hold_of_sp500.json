They're also telling me to expect an average of 9% annual gains over the course of a 30 year investment lifetime. My question is for those with a bit of experience with both (I know more people will have SP500 experience than true professionally managed MPT), but is it worth a 1% annual fee to go for 9% when that's roughly the average annual return of the SP500 anyway? I know the primary benefit, as I understand it, of the MPT isn't necessarily the actual gains, but the standard deviation over time in relation to those gains. If you can take 9% with less volatility than the same return with more volatility, it's better...  but I'm just curious how this has actually played out for folks. Any feedback from those with some experience would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the feedback guys. For those who have asked, it's Personal Captial Wealth Management. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso for those that are curious here's how the theory is applied [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TJQhQ2GZ0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TJQhQ2GZ0Y)",
