Shell is taking some noteworthy steps in restructuring the business model, with plans to only have SIX refineries in its portfolio by 2025 all of which are integrated with chemicals, biofuels, lubricants, or provide strong footing for its trading business. It's trimming its upstream assets to only a handful of cost advantaged fields and is planning on using cash generation there to bolster investments in what it has clearly outlined as its growth sectors (IE renewables). \n\nRDS has taken a different approach compared to a lot of energy majors in that it is investing in what it views as intermediate fuels versus full on electric: LNG, Hydrogen, Biofuels, etc and its plan is to leverage its large retail arm to deliver these products efficiently to customers. I see this as a decent moat as these are sectors that are harder to break into versus electricity (everyone and their mother has invested in solar and wind farms lately). Shell is [hosting a strategy day](https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2021/advance-notice-strategy-day-2021.html) to outline its plans going forward in which it is expected to discuss its business streamlining and plans for renewables. It may be worth a watch.\n\nRDS has certainly taken a beating during COVID, as have all energy companies, but with Shell's unique portfolio and real steps towards preparing for the energy transition I wouldn't be surprised if it comes out as a very strong player over the next decade. It has plans to raise its dividend soon and has kept its balance sheet in nice tidy order through the stresses of COVID.\n\nRisks I see:\n\n* Can energy majors shake off the stigma of being \"oil and gas\" companies and receive due attention for investors?\n* Will advancements in electric vehicles be significant enough to leap frog intermediate renewable fuels?\n* Will divesting significant portions of its traditional oil and gas business leave it more cash strapped than expected?\n* What is the actual timeline for seeing significant returns on its renewable investments?\n\nWhat are your own thoughts on RDS? Or other oil majors making serious steps towards an energy transition? \n\nThis post is not investment advice, its for entertainment only. I'm not a financial advisor.",
