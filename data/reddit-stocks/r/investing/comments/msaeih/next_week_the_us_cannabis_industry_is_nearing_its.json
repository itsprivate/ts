Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”\n\nSAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.\n\n>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.\n\nAs this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *\"rumour\"* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",
