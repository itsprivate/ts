Yes (In fact I even forgot to cash in a $1500 check for over a year). I'm only 23 and in grad school, so I like to look at each dollar very carefully. I'm also anguished at all the things $1500 could've bought me (a 75'' flat screen TV, a plane ticket to anywhere in the world, etc. But 1500 is only about 3% of my assets so I'm trying to sweat this off and move on as quick as possible. But I learned not to jump on stocks based on emotion. At one point, I was even up $1000 but I got too greedy and look where I'm now.\n\nOn the bright side, my overall portfolio is only down $600 since New Years Day and I'm still up 20% since last february (compared to the S&P gain on 18%)",
