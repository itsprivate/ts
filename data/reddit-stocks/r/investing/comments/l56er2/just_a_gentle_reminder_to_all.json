Is driving at 300km/h necessarily bad, if you were a skilled Formula 1 driver? Probably not. It is, however, incredibly dangerous if you just came out of driving school. That is my point. Too many investors these days are speeding because everyone else is, thinking they are driving safely. Without any precautions, plans or skill, your risk of crashing and burning is incredibly high. Right now, we are on a straight road and I don’t know how far the straight road extends, but when it gets bumpy and winding, how sure are you that the same speed that is getting you to your destination quicker, isn’t going to be the same speed that kills you?",
