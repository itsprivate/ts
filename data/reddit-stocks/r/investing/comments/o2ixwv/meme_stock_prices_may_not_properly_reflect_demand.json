The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.\n\nRetail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.\n\nBut the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week.\n\nThe review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.",
