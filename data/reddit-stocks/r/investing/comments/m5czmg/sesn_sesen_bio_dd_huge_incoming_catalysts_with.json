There will be no technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some information research and maybe you find it helpful. \n\n*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*\n\nBefore you ask, I currently hold 3652 shares at an average cost of 2.32.\n\n**About the company:**\n\nSesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.\n\n**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**\n\nThe company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).\n\nTheir main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.\n\n*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*\n\nThe preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vuucec194n61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae7df58f362a0ee4bf59bbae9d1bf08955c13b77\n\n**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.\n\n[https://sesenbio.com/our-programs/#bladder-cancer](https://sesenbio.com/our-programs/#bladder-cancer)\n\n**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**\n\n\\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.\n\n\\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.\n\n\\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.\n\n\\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.\n\n[https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/bladder-cancer/statistics](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/bladder-cancer/statistics)\n\n**This is pretty good illustration of the diagnosis to treatment:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/sesenbio.com\\/patients\\/](https://preview.redd.it/5vnz2o4394n61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41a52a3a08c4dc6344b851d12f7af2c8d21ddf6)\n\n**Why I´m very bullish and this and analysts are too:**\n\n\\- Since 2006 the Oncology Products Reviewed by FDA that have a BLA Submission (as Vicineum has) have a Probability of Approval of 82%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0mmmtw494n61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=70095d984765b665e8e4ac2694774cdb3605f0d5\n\n\\- **Forward-looking Timeline for Vicineum**\n\nPositive progress in the US and Europe enables a clear regulatory path forward with the following anticipated milestones:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u414613894n61.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=97351379e468b517ed0f766931014737dbf22050\n\n\\- **Potential for Peak Revenue of $1B - $3B Globally for Vicineum**\n\nSubstantial US opportunity and OUS potential of roughly two times the US.\n\nAn anticipated virtuous cycle of advocacy across physicians, patients/caregivers, and payers to drive rapid uptake and strong growth after approval and launch.\n\nCompelling intent to prescribe research in the US.\n\nA highly concentrated US market of \\~1,500 Urologists treating \\~75% of BCG patients allows for efficient targeting.\n\n\\- **Key partnership with leading partner in MENA (Hikma Pharmaceuticals)**\n\nA public company headquartered in London with a market cap of >$6B and >$2B in annual revenue.\n\nThe fifth-largest pharma company in the MENA region trusted and leading licensing partner in the region and extensive regulatory affairs capabilities.\n\n\\- **Huge Estimation on the OUS Opportunity for Vicineum**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e4yvyx994n61.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e14495da8a7b695fae401273ac30557ec7f03e\n\n\\- **Strengthening the Balance Sheet while Minimizing Dilution**\n\nNo outstanding debt\n\nAs of 12/31/2020 $44M available on an $85 ATM facility administered by Jefferies.\n\n[https://ir.sesenbio.com/static-files/5b335135-ecf0-4455-9ab3-49b8613ae0e1](https://ir.sesenbio.com/static-files/5b335135-ecf0-4455-9ab3-49b8613ae0e1)\n\n**What are analysts saying and price prediction:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8snbm0b94n61.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=46196f67c788760b3dc805e8a78ec64e056c7d4e\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.marketbeat.com\\/stocks\\/NASDAQ\\/SESN\\/price-target\\/](https://preview.redd.it/k411kdpb94n61.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=e29177b7c2b147f94781e0d5d57a496ee397c656)\n\n**Short, Medium- and Long-Term Indicators:**\n\n \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.barchart.com\\/stocks\\/quotes\\/SESN\\/opinion](https://preview.redd.it/5vze83qg94n61.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=05c2fae9c5b2136365ed125a2624ed24db20360a)\n\n**My opinion on all this:**\n\nVicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive.
