Honestly these should all just be comments in existing threads and us mods can't spend all day deleting repetitive posts so we'll keep things locked for a bit.\n\nAs always, if you make a post that you think is worthwhile, or is on another topic worth discussing please message us and we can approve. \n\nSide note: obviously we don't have the mod bandwith for this sort of stuff, in every \"meta\" post I've made in the last year I've asked for mod volunteers and have gotten zero.  Reddit sent us an automated message yesterday because our traffic spiked so much (automated, because admins don't give a fuck).  I'm going to leave a comment with some additional thoughts on that below.\n\nWith regard to GME, we'll have a thread coming soon, /u/jn_ku's posts have been popular so far so his 3rd installment will be allowed shortly. - and that's the thread for today unless there's some MAJOR news item.  We're still gonna keep the posts filtered because nobody pays attention to megathreads anyway. \n\n**For this thread - please feel free to have meta discussion on the subreddit and traffic, offer up suggestions, call the mods assholes, etc.  Please do not discuss GME or anything related here - that goes in the follow up megathrad**\n\nAnd for the love of christ please stop asking us for access to WSB.
