  "selftext": "There have been multiple threads posted to Reddit recently touting the potential that the Uranium industry has over the next few years. Specifically, /u/3stmotivation has done a terrific job with his(?) due diligence regarding the industry. If you had bought in to any of his recommendations back in June after reading his thread in /r/Undervalued here: [The undervalued case for uranium companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undervalued/comments/gz833b/the_undervalued_case_for_uranium_companies/), then you likely would've been up 27% on the large cap Cameco(CCJ), 128% on Denison(DNN), and 155% on Energy Fuels(UUUU). He is not the only one expecting Uranium to make huge gains, however, but I would like to use his work as a case study so that we can get an idea of what to expect for the industry. Just as a note, I decided to largely leave fundamentals of the companies and technical analysis out of this post. I can provide info about how I feel about them as well, but decided to put them on hold for now.\n\n**What is the purpose of this post?**\n\nSimple. When I read these posts about the Uranium industry having the potential to explode in the near future, I *rarely* came across reasons as to why it *wouldn't* skyrocket. Before buying in, I decided to dive deeper into reactive core to see what I could come up with.\n\n**The current situation, summed up:**\n\nIf you haven't read through Uranium investment material, I'll sum it up now. The lack of supply does not meet the current and 10 year expected demand. Because of this, the biggest producers are buying from the spot market because it's cheaper to do that than to re-open their facilities for new production. It's predicted that when spot prices hit $50+, these companies can get back to work and make great earnings while doing so. \n\nI'd like to be clear here... This is not untrue. Contracts will likely be renewed over the next couple years, starting now, driving prices up. \n\n**Uranium voices say we'll have a repeat of sky high prices during '07 and/or '11.**\n\nRemember Fukushima? The Japanese Nuclear disaster in 2011 that shut down many facilities, driving Uranium supply up and prices back down? An important piece to the puzzle of investing in a company is public perception and there is no difference when it comes to commodities. For this exercise however, I frankly don't care what the public's perception is. The *reality* is that Nuclear power is safer and reduces carbon more effectively than every other way we produce power. Nuclear power is only getting **safer** because of these kinds of disasters. Regulations are incredibly strict when it comes to Nuclear power because of the implications, bringing my first point into focus...\n\n**Uranium *can't* be competitive.**\n\nIndustries that are forced to comply with significant safety standards set by government regulations cannot adapt quickly to a changing economy. With that said, the companies that have survived this sector are well suited to withstand the regulations they're forced to deal with. But mooning? That's out of the equation.\n\n**Renewable Energy is the future/can't power the entire grid.**\n\nRenewable energy can't power the entire grid and it's not our only future. The reality is that our future is made up of Renewables, Nuclear, Fossil Fuels, and a healthy balance of other energy sources. Why is this the case? Many reasons. Fossil fuels will run out and harm the environment, renewables aren't as productive or reliable and take up a lot of space at the same time, and Nuclear is damn expensive and takes forever to get running. Let's look at this last point...\n\n**Nuclear is expensive and takes *forever* to get running.**\n\nIt costs *billions* of dollars to get a new Nuclear facility up and running. Natural gas takes a fraction of the cost. Nuclear, while turning a profit at a better rate and with less carbon output than Natural Gas, also takes *at least a half decade* to even be built. Out pacing a Natural Gas facility's profitability doesn't begin until nearly a decade *after* a Nuclear facility is built. And that's *without* further technological improvements of Natural Gas facilities bringing costs down further. Who exactly has 10-15 years and billions of dollars to spend on an endeavor that will likely need heavily regulated maintenance and repairs shortly after profitability outpaces its competitors? \n\n**Not politicians, that's for sure.**  \n\nThe billion dollar price tag for Nuclear can only be covered by 1 purse, the political purse. Let me ask you this, how many high level representatives can you name that have been in positions of power for 15 years? The way you advance in politics is by winning and you have a short time frame to do that. Investing yourself in legislation that pumps up Nuclear energy, against horrible public perception, will not net you the quick wins needed to continue moving up the ladder. No one wants a part of this like they do Renewables or even Natural Gas.\n\n**So is Uranium actually worth investing in?**\n\nThe short answer? It *could* be, but only for the intermediate term. 3STmotivation specifically mentions a horizon over the next few years and how important it is to keep an eye on spot prices and the industry when we get a few years down the road. Based on what I've learned during my research, this is not a long term play until *significant* improvements are made for Nuclear.\n\n**What about for the intermediate term?**\n\nDuring the bull run from mid 2010 to the beginning of 2011, CCJ, DNN, and UUUU shot up about 65%, 150%, and nearly 500% respectively. Unfortunately, over the following 6 month time frame, they lost basically all of those gains and have been in decline for the 10 years since. Fukushima played its part with reassuring the public that Nuclear was dangerous and may have been a catalyst for this meltdown, but the continual decline in value is evident. These are huge gains, no doubt, but be understanding of the industry as a whole and how the market reacts before buying in.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nI ultimately decided ***not*** to buy into Uranium. I think the industry is Undervalued for a reason, ie. valued appropriately. My investment strategy does not include investing or trading commodities so it was easier to pass on this, but that is not to say money cannot be made here. I simply don't believe this to be a long term play and the short/intermediate term is too volatile, difficult to fully grasp, and risky for most investors. 3STmotivation provided great analysis of the industry and the companies that are probably best equipped to benefit from the upcoming catalysts, so I thank him for encouraging my research. \n\n\nRemember, not everything affordable is worth buying.",
