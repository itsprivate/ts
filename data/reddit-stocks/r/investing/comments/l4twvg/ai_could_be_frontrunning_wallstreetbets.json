So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.\n\nThat outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.",
