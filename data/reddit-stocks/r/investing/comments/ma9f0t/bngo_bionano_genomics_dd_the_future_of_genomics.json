He also has experience with major financing events, acquisitions, and scaling revenues in high-growth tech companies. He joined Bionano from Tesla, where he served as Head of the Maxwell Ultracapacitors business unit after Maxwell Technology was acquired by Tesla.\n\n**CMO Alka Chaubey, PhD, FACMG**\n\nAlka is double board-certified in clinical cytogenetics/genomics and clinical molecular genetics/genomics by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG).\n\nPreviously, she was the Head of Cytogenomics at PerkinElmer Genomics, where Dr. Chaubey led the successful development and launch of several innovative products including the CNGnome test (low-pass whole genome sequencing), and a new FSHD assay utilizing Saphyr. She has also played an integral role on the Vanadis team at PerkinElmer in their efforts to bring a new PCR-free NIPT technology to the market. Prior to PerkinElmer Genomics, Dr. Chaubey was the Director of the Cytogenomics Laboratory at the Greenwood Genetic Center, SC, USA.\n\n**Board of Directors:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chairman Dr. David L.

The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PUT / CALL Ratio:**\n\nBionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BNGO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BNGO/put-call-ratios)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Share Statistics:**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.\n\nWe do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.\n\nMoving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competitors:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).\n\nComparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.\n\nPrice aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.\n\n\\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.\n\n\\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.\n\n\\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**\n\n\\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.\n\n\\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”\n\n[*https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/23/2149974/0/en/Publication-Reveals-in-Side-by-Side-Comparison-that-Method-Using-PacBio-Sequencing-Detects-Only-72-of-the-Large-Structural-Variants-Detected-by-Optical-Genome-Mapping-with-Saphyr.html*](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/23/2149974/0/en/Publication-Reveals-in-Side-by-Side-Comparison-that-Method-Using-PacBio-Sequencing-Detects-Only-72-of-the-Large-Structural-Variants-Detected-by-Optical-Genome-Mapping-with-Saphyr.html)\n\n\\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.\n\n\\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.\n\n[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)\n\n\\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.\n\n[*https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227728v1*](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227728v1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Latests news:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**\n\nValidation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from \"no-call\" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.\n\nThe company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.\n\nAll in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.\n\n[*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-buying-bionano-stock-says-184238222.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-buying-bionano-stock-says-184238222.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**\n\nBionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.\n\nThe Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.\n\n[*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bionano-genomics-bngo-might-135301546.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bionano-genomics-bngo-might-135301546.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR & My plan:**\n\nI´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.\n\nThis is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments, if something needs to be added or you have medical knowledge that can add to this DD feel free to comment and I´ll add it.",

Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/\"><em>https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/</em></a></p>\n\n<p>- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227728v1\"><em>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227728v1</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latests news:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from &quot;no-call&quot; reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.</p>\n\n<p>The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-buying-bionano-stock-says-184238222.html\"><em>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-buying-bionano-stock-says-184238222.html</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.</p>\n\n<p>The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.</p>\n\n<p>A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bionano-genomics-bngo-might-135301546.html\"><em>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bionano-genomics-bngo-might-135301546.html</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR &amp; My plan:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think in the comments, if something needs to be added or you have medical knowledge that can add to this DD feel free to comment and I´ll add it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
