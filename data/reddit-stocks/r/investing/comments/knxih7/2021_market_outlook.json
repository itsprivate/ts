I've made it my new year's resolution to continue improving this forum to be more informative and helpful for everyone so please feel free to leave any feedbacks!\n\nAs we enter the new year, I believe it is important to keep things in a broader perspective. That means we need to keep a bigger picture of where we are now and where we are heading, per the Mosaic theory as I mentioned previously in #2 of this post.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing\\_philosophy\\_plz\\_read\\_this/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAs Howard Marks states in his book \"Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side\", if we can understand where we are in the broader market cycle, we can position ourselves in better odds to win.\n\nAfter all, our goal is to invest for the best risk/reward scenarios, whether it means buying stocks, purchase a house, shorting treasuries, or doing a combination of different things. As long as we take care of the downside, the upside will take care of itself.\n\nThat is why it is critical to understand what's going on around us right now.\n\nBelow are some headlines and graphs that will put things into perspective.\n\n(Images are not allowed here so please check the original post if you're interested in the graphs)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market\\_commentary\\_2021\\_outlook\\_12312020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market_commentary_2021_outlook_12312020/)\n\n📷\n\nCorporate profits improving\n\n📷\n\nNegative correlation between debt amounts and corporate yield, either corporate yield has to go up (which means corporate spread widening, or a correction/recession) or the amount of debt has to come down. I believe that it is more likely that the corporate spread will go up as it is much likely for companies to face distress than for them to reduce the amount of leverage in a short period of time.\n\nPlease note this post about how I argued it's more likely for the corporate spread to widen than to narrow.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/k53sd5/market\\_commentary\\_headed\\_for\\_another\\_december/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/k53sd5/market_commentary_headed_for_another_december/)\n\n📷\n\nLarge volumes of IG corporate bond issuance\n\n📷\n\nLarge volumes of HY corporate bond issuance\n\n📷\n\nRelatively tight IG spreads\n\n📷\n\nRelatively tight HY spreads\n\n📷\n\nLow corporate yield\n\n📷\n\nRising amount of companies with covenant-lite loans. Higher amount of CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), which are similar to the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) seen in 2008. For now, it seems to me that they're bundling a bunch of cov-lite and distressed loans into tranches and selling them to raise money. Don't focus on this too much if you are not familiar with the security but keep this in mind for later.\n\n📷\n\nNot surprisingly, energy, cyclicals, and transportations are all struggling compared to the strengths in the tech sector.\n\nHigher leverage globally and in US\n\nInvestors using record amount of margins to invest.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600?mod=itp\\_wsj&mod=djemITP\\_h](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600?mod=itp_wsj&mod=djemITP_h)\n\nStocks close record high\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\nBased on the preceding information, it is pretty clear to see that we have the following list of observations.\n\n1. More debt, including both IG and HY, are being issued across all sectors, all countries, and all types of institutions, even at the individual levels.\n2. Corporate spreads are compressed, for that matter all rates including munis, ABS, CLOs, loans, and short-term rates (don't get hung up on any unfamiliar names or security types, as the point is that we are seeing both record amounts of leverage when the yields are at the lowest point. Normally, they go the opposite directions).\n3. Risk assets (stocks, real estate, loans, bitcoin?) are trending up.\n4. Economic conditions are improving as indicated by rising corporate profits.\n\nThis is all happening when COVID cases and deaths are surging to record highs and a lot of the countries have imposed restrictions.\n\nIf you were asked in April when the US was just going into a lockdown phase where we would be in late 2020, would you have guessed all of it? Specifically the point about surging COVID cases and deaths in conjunction with a record-high stock market and tight corporate spreads? Personally, I am amazed at all of these as they mostly defy the traditional econ 101 or finance 101 schools of thought. Remember all those PhD economists, market forecasters, and investors arguing for the worst stock market, crazy levels of inflation, and rising bond yields? They all got it wrong. How?\n\nThis leads me to the topic for today's post.\n\nWhile the markets have surprised everyone, the list of observations isn't actually all that surprising considering the magnitude of the monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nWe have seen an unprecedented (probably the most used word in 2020) amount of actions from both the Fed and the gov't.\n\nSource: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-11/56746-MBR.pdf\n\nJust these two graphs show the extent of the stimulus provided to the country.\n\nMost of you are probably familiar with the story up until this point, as they have been mentioned numerous times in news articles.\n\nThe next part is where I think it will get a bit interesting.\n\n**My personal opinion on stocks is that we will see a broader market rally for the long term (2-5 years) with a few corrections in between.**\n\nIt is the Fed that usually causes a recession or a depression even.\n\n📷\n\nIf you look closely, most, if not all, recessions were just after when the Fed raised rates. Obviously controlling the rates is not the only maneuver that the Fed pulled over the years but it does indicate the Fed's willingness to turn hawkish (raising rates and tightening monetary policy).\n\nRemember 2018 Christmas market meltdown? That was also caused by the Fed being too hawkish than the market could handle. JPowell immediately changed his stance based on the market reaction and turned dovish instead.\n\nBut why would Fed try to kill the economy with tighter monetary policy? It's because of the fear of inflation. Inflation can get out of hand in no time and their role is to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that all we need to focus on at the moment is the Fed action and the government policy in order to see where the market is heading for the next 2-5 years. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that their policies are so significant and so powerful that they are almost single-handedly driving the economic recovery and the markets.\n\nWe don't need to worry about the Fed turning hawkish as the Fed has explicitly promised us we won't get any balance sheet contraction or rate hikes for the next 2-3 years until we have beaten the inflation target on average.\n\nWe also don't need to worry about the government reducing its deficit as they have also promised to spend for the country, and worry about the deficits later.\n\nTo summarize, we've got a few forces in action.\n\n1. Favorable Fed and government policies -> Positive to the risk-assets\n2. Signs of excess: EV bubble, bitcoin, risk assets rally, margin investing record highs, market sentiment at the highest, put to call volume ratio at the lowest, and so on. -> Negative to the risk-assets\n3. Vaccine coming up -> Positive to the risk-assets\n\nMy personal feeling is that we will certainly see a few quick, out-of-nowhere corrections in the risk markets (stock markets) in the short-term due to the signs of excess I have observed. But the monetary and fiscal policies are too powerful to fight against.\n\nTherefore, I have positioned myself for shares in stocks, as opposed to call options or bull spreads (as they are too short-term), short treasuries, long gold, long cleantech, and a good amount of cash (20-30% cash). I will be observing the markets from the sidelines for a bit and decide when to pounce.\n\nAs always, please feel free to share your ideas or opinions.\n\nI hope everyone has a great New Year's Eve and look forward to a great 2021!\n\nThanks for reading and see you next year!",
