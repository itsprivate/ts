Sweden’s biggest pension funds from AP, and Sweden’s most famous technology funds from Swedbank will also officially be a part of the IPO. And these are only requests because shares are not guaranteed. There will be a free float of 17,9%, and there’s a high probability that everybody won’t get the shares they’ve requested, which could cause for huge demand on opening day. Considering the huge demand that exists right now and the fact that not everybody will be granted shares, there’s a good chance that this could lead to GGPI rallying today.\n\nGGPI is a Spac that has an official agreement to merge with Polestar in the near future. Polestar is an electric vehicle company with a revenue of over a billion and has already delivered 20,000 cars as of October this year. Polestar’s cars have been received very well by independent reviewers and are usually ranked high on the lists of the greatest electric vehicles ever produced in the world today. Volvo Cars owns 49% of Polestar. If Volvo Cars opens strongly today and their IPO does good, there’s a huge chance that people who have missed out on buying Volvo’s stock, or people who want to be a part of Volvo’s future will run towards Polestar and buy GGPI which will cause it to rally.\n\nTL;DR If Volvo Cars does well today on IPO day, there’s a huge chance that Volvo owned Polestar will rally today too, which is the spac ’GGPI’ that has an official agreement to merge with Polestar.",
