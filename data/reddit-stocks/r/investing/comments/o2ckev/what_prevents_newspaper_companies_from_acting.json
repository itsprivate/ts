Their information gathering process seemed very similar to the ones used by regular news outlets to discover shady business practices, interviewing former employees and examining hard-to-find information. Furthermore, as far as I could tell, this appeared to be totally legal.\n\nMy question is, why don’t news companies do the same thing as Hindenburg when they discover similarly damaging information about a public company? I’m aware that individual employees are likely prevented from doing this by their contract, but what stops the overall company from shorting these companies? Is it just journalistic integrity, or are there laws that would apply to news companies and not to ones like Hindenburg?",
