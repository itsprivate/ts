While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. \n\nSome may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  \n\nEither way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. \n\nI genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.",
