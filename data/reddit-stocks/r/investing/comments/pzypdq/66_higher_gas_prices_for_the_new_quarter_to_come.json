This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.\n\nIn Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).\n\nI look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.\n\nPlease use the link for Ukraine Gas prices: [https://www.ueex.com.ua/eng/exchange-quotations/](https://www.ueex.com.ua/eng/exchange-quotations/)\n\nOctober prices (Q4) are booming!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, they just had an update to sell their 35% interest in KUBGAS (East Ukraine). So they will be focused on clean books, RK field with electricity they want to expand, gas assets in the West, while having de-risked from the East of Ukraine.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cub-energy-announces-letter-agreement-132300219.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cub-energy-announces-letter-agreement-132300219.html)\n\nSo this should be strong earnings in Q3 and then clean books when this sales deal closes, de-risking from Eastern Ukraine. Trading below Cash and Equity (not taking into account the RK field in the books) after this deal. I believe the cash will mostly be used to further develop the RK field.\n\nLooks to me to be trading below the cash level after this deal is finalized. RK field is not in the books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood article on rising gas and electricity prices in Europe. Winter still has to come. Looking good for KUB.
