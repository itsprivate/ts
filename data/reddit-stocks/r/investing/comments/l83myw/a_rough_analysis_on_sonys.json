Sony Music, Sony Studios, Sony Pictures, Playstation, Sony Electronics etc. It is impossible to enter any Entertainment industry without finding Sony staring back. In the Age of Media Sony is destined to reign supreme.\n\n**THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.**\n\n\\- Sony has essentially won the console wars, demand for the playstation 5 is rabid and unstoppable, held back by only supply issues. Once that gets resolved $SNE will have essentially a monopoly on home consoles. Microsoft doesn't even come close to amount of sales in the home space.\n\n\\- There is no Sony Car, that would be stupid. The future of cars is entertainment vehicles filled with screens. Sony will be one of the most essential car suppliers in the future. They have decades in the electronics space, cameras, sensors, displays, media modules, speakers. If $BB is the bread of the auto space, $SNE will be the butter.\n\n\\-In the worst case scenario, $SNE has a working EV platform that looks damn sexy that any       small car company can license/purchase/use/share. Sony has begun testing them on roads.\n\n\\- SNE won't enter the streaming space as another shitty streaming app. That is smart, SNE can focus on licensing and production their core strength. Why waste time and money on something saturated with competitors and users are unwilling to switch.\n\n\\- The gold rush may have been filled with miners looking for gold, but the winners were the suppliers and merchants.

Increased market share and increased cost of games to 70$ should boost demand.\n* Sony pictures is down but covid will end and they have a lot of big budget films pent up.\n* Good growth from every other division besides image and pictures.\n* Financial metrics show a undervalued P/E and  even with current trajectory.\n* Sony will probably Gorilla dick earnings next week.\n\nupdated\n\n&#x200B;",
