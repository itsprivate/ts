Something about investors won't buy it unless it has a higher interest rate because fear of inflation. Now that we're on the verge of signing in a 1.9 trillion stimulus bill, I have a some questions about the effect on the bond market.\n\n* When does the US treasury sell the 1.9 trillion in bonds to pay for it?\n* Does it do it in one massive sale? What types of bonds does it sell (2 year, 5 year, 10 year)?\n* If bonds are already selling poorly, then wouldn't a massive influx of bonds on the market make the yield situation even worse?\n* Are investors/banks prepared to buy it all up? Or will the federal reserve step in and buy the remainder?\n* Is it therefore possible that the signing of the stimulus will actually hurt stocks in the short term due to bond market/yield fluctuations?\n* Can anyone explain what happened with US treasury/bonds during the 2 trillion stimulus last year? Or the 900 billion stimulus earlier this year?\n\nThanks for any insight guys! New to the bond side of the market",
