It felt REALLY good to see the growth it has done. Theeeeeen came the covid drop. I sold halfway down the drop, my entire brokerage portfolio and Roth IRA for about a 50% gains loss of my ENTIRE time investing. I did this because I believed that it will drop even more, which it did for a some days, but then it went back up, and back up, and back up, and kept going back up. I kept telling myself that it was a dead cat bounce and the market will drop even further than before and it never did. I tried to time the market and got rekt. I didnt even get back into investing late last year so I lost out on a good bit of money if I had just kept everything in.\n\n**Lesson:** Timing the market is hard. It is SO much easier to just keep everything in and put MORE money into your positions on red days.\n\n**What I am doing now to not repeat the same mistake:** I got back into the game late last year and I will not touch my investments ever again. I have also set aside a 4-ish month emergency fund that I will never touch. I believe part of the reason why I sold during the covid drop was also because I didnt have an emergency fund set aside and I got emotional with my investments. Now even my portfolio drops 50% in 1 day I still have 4 months of living expenses if I lost my job so I would still be carrying out my day to day living normally\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PT 2 IN COMMENTS**",
