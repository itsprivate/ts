Here is a list and a quick reason for my thinking about each sector: \n\nElectric vehicles/renewable energy- The future of automobiles is electric.  Almost all major auto makers are producing some line of electric vehicles, not to mention TESLA and NIO as fully eclectic companies with massive growth last year. \n\nMarijuana- The mj industry is still just beginning compared to where it will be at in 20 years from now.  More and more states will legalize allowing for huge growth especially if it is legalized on a federal level.  When/if it is legalized on a federal level, I  believe both the medical and recreational  aspects of mj will take a bigger role creating more consumers. \n\nHealthcare- According to AARP, 10,000 people turn 65 everyday in the United States.  Life expectancy will likely continue to lengthen creating more revenue on average per person over their life.  This number will only increase in the coming years as well.  Advancing healthcare technology such as stem cell research for example will continue to innovate and create new treatments and cures creating a bigger market and more growth.  \n\nAutonomous technology-  Self driving cars, robots, AI, are all growing industries.  They are the way of the future.  Technology is advancing at an exponential pace creating exponential growth.  Self serving cars for citizens as well as self driving semi trucks are coming very soon.  There are companies already testing self driving semi trucks and they will possibly wipe out the human trucking industry within the next 10 years. \n\n I would love to hear some other ideas you may have!",
