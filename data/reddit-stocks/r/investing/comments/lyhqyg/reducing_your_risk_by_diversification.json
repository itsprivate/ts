Let me explain why.\n\nThere are two kinds of risks. One is systematic risk and the other is non-systematic risk. We can eliminate non-systematic risk through diversification, but not systematic risk. Systematic risk is also called market risk which means it impacts the whole market. For example, this could be due to a hike in interest rates, Treasury Yields rising and etc. This impacts the whole market and cannot be diversified.\n\nHowever, there is also called non-systematic risk. This is a firm-specific or industry-specific risk. For example, if a company has a product recall, the risk is only for that specific company and not other companies. An industry-specific risk is if the whole industry is shaken by something only impacting that industry. For example, we saw this with oil prices a year ago. Oil companies went down, but other companies weren't specifically down.\n\nWhy does this matter and how does it relate to risk. Well, we can eliminate all non-systematic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. The reason for this is because many stocks won't be as correlated with one another, which means that any really bad gains can be offset by any really good gains and vice versa. Theoretically, You won't be exposed to non-systematic risk since you are eliminating it by holding a diversified portfolio. The only risk you have is systematic risk (market risk). Theoretically, we are not compensated by non-systematic risk since it is a risk we can diversify.\n\nJust keep in mind that when you buy industry-specific ETF's or if your portfolio is concentrated in one sector, you are exposing yourself to more risk than necessary.",
