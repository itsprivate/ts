Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*\n\nI’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.\n\nHere we go.\n\nOctober 2nd: $263\n\nOctober 3rd: $277\n\nOctober 6th: $292\n\nOctober 7th: $287\n\nOctober 8th: $294\n\nOctober 9th: $296\n\nOctober 10th: $342\n\nOctober 13th: $353\n\nOctober 14th: $352\n\nOctober 15th: $390\n\nOctober 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**\n\nOctober 17th: $358\n\nOctober 20th: $277\n\nOctober 21st: $242\n\nOctober 22nd: $243\n\nOctober 23rd: $229\n\nOctober 24th: $210\n\nOctober 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**\n\nOctober 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**\n\nOctober 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**\n\nOctober 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**\n\nOctober 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**\n\nThe stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.\n\n*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn’t* the squeeze.\n\n*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.\n\nIs 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn’t matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.\n\nAbsolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.\n\nNow, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.\n\n**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want.*\n\n<Insert rocket ship emoji>\n\nPosition: >0, <69.75M @ >$0, < $483",
