Essentially the government made themselves a get-out-of-jail-for-free card.\n\n2: The lira continues to drop and inflation continues to spike, and they either have to backpedal or end up printing absolute tons of money to make up for the insane losses people are having on their deposits which will debase the currency even further. Either option will obliterate whatever trust is left in the government's ability to handle the economy.\n\nInflation is projected to reach 30% next year so they are absolutely playing with fire here.
