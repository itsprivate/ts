You want control over the situation, then use \"Limit Orders\" and assign the price at the proper support levels. You know who uses \"Limit Orders\" the bull with the 10 inch cock that comes over to fuck your wife every night while you sit in the corner chair and watch. Why you might ask? Because he's in control of the situation. He uses limit orders to buy the stock at a specific price instead of just sending the order to the markets makers to be assigned the highest price on the book for the day. So while you are buying that stock at $38.50, he's buying at a cool even $35.00, allowing him to capture 10% more on the upside. \n\nPerfect example is with GME, where the entire sub is screaming \"hold the line\" blah blah blah \"SPARTA\". You want to hold the line? Then place those future orders at support levels like 33 or 30. That way if and when the stock drops to these levels you get the price you want and you help the stock from dropping even further. So be fucking smart and be patient about this, this is your money so make it work for you and not against you.  \n\nTLDR: Use limit orders if you really want to help control the underlying stock and make a smart investment. Be patient and wait for the price to come to you and so some fucking reasearch.",
