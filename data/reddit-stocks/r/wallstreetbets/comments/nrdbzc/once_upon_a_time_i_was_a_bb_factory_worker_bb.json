  "selftext": "Hey All,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line. \n\nWith nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love. \n\nSo I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me. \n\nTHAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid. \n\nTLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.",
