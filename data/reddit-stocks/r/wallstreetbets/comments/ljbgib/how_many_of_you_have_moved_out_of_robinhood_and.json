F\\*\\*k Robinhood.\n\nAnyway, I was just curious if I was the only one moving out of Robinhood or are there other folks here doing the same. If you are moving out, what did you pick as an alternative to Robinhood, and why? I think your experience will probably help others decide where they want to move.

I meant to say \"near future\", I guess.
