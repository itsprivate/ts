I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n\nCongrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n\nThe first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n\nMACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n\nAnd the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n\nI hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! \n\n(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",
