  "selftext": "**OSTK is undervalued**. At first glance, one may wonder does a stock with a >4000% run from its 52-week low and up 54% YTD have room to grow?\n\n**Point 1:** There has not been broader market interest in this stock in over a year. Put simply, demand for shares as examined through volume traded at 1D, 1M, 1 quarter, as well as 1 year averages is at a low.\n\n[Fig 1 - OSTK overview](https://preview.redd.it/4fwgbra2lih61.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=00f85d806f01c47f65ad010a3981b60ee7bf68ce)\n\n**Point 2:** OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1.1x sales. The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair (W).\n\n[Fig 2 - OSTK and W relative comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/n0vk6gc5lih61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28eca64e8d10be029dce04ef5fee1581a9c9225)\n\n**Point 3:** Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing. 1 month ago, institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40% through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley, Allianz SE, Blackrock, and Vanguard as well. In fact, Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year. [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf)\n\nLast week, Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7.5%.\n\n[Fig 3 - Bloomie institutional data](https://preview.redd.it/68kml1a8lih61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f684e7ee5daa2ebb826024e1e9d96aa022d004)\n\n[Fig 4 - Bloomie institutional breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/vlmpdnxalih61.png?width=1406&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf75af436e7f99886df888dad8b22ebef332cf3a)\n\n**Point 4:** OSTK has short interest of over 10%. With 42.77 million shares outstanding, and a 40 million share float, latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4.374 million shares are currently held short. While that may seem relatively small, naked short selling is still occurring with 6 SEC fail-to-delivers of over 200,000 shares occurring on OSTK.\n\n20210104|690370101|OSTK|221|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|47.97\n\n20210105|690370101|OSTK|135655|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|49.46\n\n20210106|690370101|OSTK|13029|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|53.73\n\n20210111|690370101|OSTK|22008|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|53.64\n\n20210112|690370101|OSTK|60859|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|51.99\n\n20210113|690370101|OSTK|34824|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|60.68\n\nLegendary short trader Marc Cohodes is long on this name and I learned about this stock from his posts on Twitter.\n\n**Point 5:** OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker-dealer issues (\\*cough\\* Robinhood \\*cough\\*) and transparency at the right time. Briefly, tZero is an alternative trading system **regulated** by the SEC that will enable people to invest in **any** asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times. Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto, tokenized securities, and stocks. \n\nCurrent assets include OSTKO, tZEROp, ASPD. With the acquisition of Bitt: B/T/C, E/T/H, L/T/C, and RVN are now tradeable. The current roadmap is to have traditional securities such as stocks traded on the platform by Q4 2021. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005384/en/tZERO-CEO-Saum-Noursalehi-Recaps-2020-Previews-the-Year-Ahead](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005384/en/tZERO-CEO-Saum-Noursalehi-Recaps-2020-Previews-the-Year-Ahead)\n\n[Fig 5 - tZERO trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/b4jyb74elih61.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9af5bbe4794c9067dd22fb60792bf942598d8d9)\n\n[Fig 6 - tZERO $ nominal trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/swgb2o1hlih61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f12882ff8c6c34e6d12df252871cc6f0a6f94a)\n\n**Point 5:** OSTK holds a 90% stake in tZERO. tZERO is nascent. With only $53 million traded in digital token securities, this is small to other markets and exchanges. However, this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020.\n\nNumbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear. The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year-to-year traded.\n\nCoinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion. In 2020, it had a revenue of $2.3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion. Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks.\n\nNapkin math: simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities ($53 million in digital tokens + $13 million in c$rypto = $67 million), this implies tZero has a valuation of $2.5 billion when compared to Coinbase. Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear, OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value.\n\n[Fig 7 - Coinbase revenue](https://preview.redd.it/vxnyrjzllih61.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3d11ee7aa6852ff0f4826b829376028a61b6fa)\n\nDYOR. Know your risk. Size appropriately. Manage your own trade.\n\nImportant areas to watch next 130, 172, 256, 394, 482, 512.\n\n**tl;dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK's true value.**\n\nOn a simple relative valuation, OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios. Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK, tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same valuation of OSTK. This does not include future performance, multiples, or other blockchain businesses such as Voatz that OSTK has a stake in.\n\nQ4 earnings 2/24/21.\n\nPotential headwinds: Execution by management of their timeline for tZERO's rollout. Failure to get FINRA approval for stocks. G20 simultaneous regulation of c$ryptocurrencies. Slowing down of the economy and appetite for risk assets such as c$ryptocurrenices in 2H 2021.",

At first glance, one may wonder does a stock with a &gt;4000% run from its 52-week low and up 54% YTD have room to grow?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 1:</strong> There has not been broader market interest in this stock in over a year. Put simply, demand for shares as examined through volume traded at 1D, 1M, 1 quarter, as well as 1 year averages is at a low.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4fwgbra2lih61.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00f85d806f01c47f65ad010a3981b60ee7bf68ce\">Fig 1 - OSTK overview</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 2:</strong> OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1.1x sales. The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair (W).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n0vk6gc5lih61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28eca64e8d10be029dce04ef5fee1581a9c9225\">Fig 2 - OSTK and W relative comparisons</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 3:</strong> Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing. 1 month ago, institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40% through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley, Allianz SE, Blackrock, and Vanguard as well. In fact, Blackrock was against OSTK&#39;s direction towards digital blockchain technology last year. <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf\">https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Last week, Allianz SE increased it&#39;s stake to 7.5%.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/68kml1a8lih61.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f684e7ee5daa2ebb826024e1e9d96aa022d004\">Fig 3 - Bloomie institutional data</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vlmpdnxalih61.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf75af436e7f99886df888dad8b22ebef332cf3a\">Fig 4 - Bloomie institutional breakdown</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 4:</strong> OSTK has short interest of over 10%. With 42.77 million shares outstanding, and a 40 million share float, latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4.374 million shares are currently held short. While that may seem relatively small, naked short selling is still occurring with 6 SEC fail-to-delivers of over 200,000 shares occurring on OSTK.</p>\n\n<p>20210104|690370101|OSTK|221|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|47.97</p>\n\n<p>20210105|690370101|OSTK|135655|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|49.46</p>\n\n<p>20210106|690370101|OSTK|13029|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|53.73</p>\n\n<p>20210111|690370101|OSTK|22008|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|53.64</p>\n\n<p>20210112|690370101|OSTK|60859|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|51.99</p>\n\n<p>20210113|690370101|OSTK|34824|OVERSTOCK COM INC DEL|60.68</p>\n\n<p>Legendary short trader Marc Cohodes is long on this name and I learned about this stock from his posts on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 5:</strong> OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker-dealer issues (*cough* Robinhood *cough*) and transparency at the right time. Briefly, tZero is an alternative trading system <strong>regulated</strong> by the SEC that will enable people to invest in <strong>any</strong> asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times. Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto, tokenized securities, and stocks. </p>\n\n<p>Current assets include OSTKO, tZEROp, ASPD. With the acquisition of Bitt: B/T/C, E/T/H, L/T/C, and RVN are now tradeable. The current roadmap is to have traditional securities such as stocks traded on the platform by Q4 2021. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005384/en/tZERO-CEO-Saum-Noursalehi-Recaps-2020-Previews-the-Year-Ahead\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005384/en/tZERO-CEO-Saum-Noursalehi-Recaps-2020-Previews-the-Year-Ahead</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b4jyb74elih61.png?width=3284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9af5bbe4794c9067dd22fb60792bf942598d8d9\">Fig 5 - tZERO trading volume</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/swgb2o1hlih61.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f12882ff8c6c34e6d12df252871cc6f0a6f94a\">Fig 6 - tZERO $ nominal trading volume</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 5:</strong> OSTK holds a 90% stake in tZERO. tZERO is nascent. With only $53 million traded in digital token securities, this is small to other markets and exchanges. However, this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear. The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year-to-year traded.</p>\n\n<p>Coinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion. In 2020, it had a revenue of $2.3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion. Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Napkin math: simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities ($53 million in digital tokens + $13 million in c$rypto = $67 million), this implies tZero has a valuation of $2.5 billion when compared to Coinbase. Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear, OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vxnyrjzllih61.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3d11ee7aa6852ff0f4826b829376028a61b6fa\">Fig 7 - Coinbase revenue</a></p>\n\n<p>DYOR. Know your risk. Size appropriately. Manage your own trade.</p>\n\n<p>Important areas to watch next 130, 172, 256, 394, 482, 512.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK&#39;s true value.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On a simple relative valuation, OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios. Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK, tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same valuation of OSTK. This does not include future performance, multiples, or other blockchain businesses such as Voatz that OSTK has a stake in.</p>\n\n<p>Q4 earnings 2/24/21.</p>\n\n<p>Potential headwinds: Execution by management of their timeline for tZERO&#39;s rollout. Failure to get FINRA approval for stocks. G20 simultaneous regulation of c$ryptocurrencies. Slowing down of the economy and appetite for risk assets such as c$ryptocurrenices in 2H 2021.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
