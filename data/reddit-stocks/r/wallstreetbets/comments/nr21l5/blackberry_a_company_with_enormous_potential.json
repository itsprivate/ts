Obviously it is a lot to unpack but here are the important aspects of my findings thus far:\n\nBlackberry (ticker BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments around the world. **Blackberry secures more than 500 million endpoints including more than 175 million cars on the road today**. Changes to data privacy laws in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions are compounding the challenges faced by organizations by increasing their responsibilities for securing their data as well as that of their customers. This is where Blackberry fills the void; there is no technology that has been exclusively or commercially adopted as the industry standard for many of the products and services offered by blackberry.\n\nBlackberry’s go-to-market strategy focuses principally on generating revenue from enterprise software, services and licensing. The company intends to drive revenue growth and to achieve margins that are consistent with those of other enterprise software companies.  \n\n**Blackberry owns 38,000 worldwide patents**. It owns rights to an array of patented and patent pending technologies which include operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, enterprise software, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications. Blackberry knows the value behind its patents and as such has a team of in-house patent attorneys ready to put pen to paper should any company infringe on its intellectual property. Blackberry believes that its patent portfolio continues to provide a competitive advantage in its core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies.\n\nOther interesting facts:\n\nBlackberry QNX is a preferred supplier of embedded systems for companies building medical devices, train-control systems, industrial robots, hardware security modules, building automation systems, green energy solutions, and other mission critical applications. Blackberry QNX technology is embedded in over 175 million cars.\n\nBlackberry AtHoc has received FedRAMP certification and is the leading provider of network-centric, interactive crisis communication to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, among other governmental bodies. Blackberry AtHoc helps to protect more than 70% of U.S. government personnel.\n\n*Disclaimer: Not financial advice, please do your own DD.*",
