Start with WHAT A SHARE OF STOCK ACTUALLY REPRESENTS, and that you are paying a price for a small percentage of ownership in that company and its current (or potential/eventual) profits.  Start with BASIC company valuation - learn about market cap, PE ratios, P/S ratios.  Learn how to read an income statement and balance sheet.  Make sure companies have a path to profitability if they are not making money.  With this knowledge, you can start to understand for yourself if a company is potentially over or undervalued.  Start with what companies you know and understand what they are selling, along with trends that you know and understand. When you start getting into stuff that you don't understand or see the vision for, you're just along for the ride.  Trial by fire and just getting into it is fine (I learn constantly from my own mistakes and practice makes perfect), but make it a very small percent of what you have. Buy partial shares. Also, realize you will need to probably buy and hold many stocks...it won't just happen overnight. Recent MEME stocks are an exception. When that happens, awesome. But it's rarely like that.
