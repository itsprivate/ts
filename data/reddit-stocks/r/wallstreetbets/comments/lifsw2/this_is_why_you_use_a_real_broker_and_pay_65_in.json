I've started by buying these contracts on RH and have been paying an average of .14 or even .15 just to get filled. I've had a few .13 filled, but the bid in the quote below are my 7 for my Robinhood account. I'm very eager to buy these contracts, so while I wait for that to fill, I started buying on Fidelity in my IRA. As you can see, I bought 91 contracts where I put in a limit order for .15, and Fidelity was able to get them filled at .13. ALL WHILE MY .13 ROBINHOOD ORDER ISN'T FILLING.\n\nI paid $.65 in commission for Fidelity but they are filling, where as I'd have to move my Robinhood order up to .14 or .15 just to fill, costing even more than the Fidelity commission. Holy shit, here's the proof of just how terrible we're all getting fucked by Robinhood. It's been 10 minutes and I'm still waiting on RH to fill.
