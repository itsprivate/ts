Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!\n\n**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings\n\nNasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)\n\n**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.\n\n**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.\n\n**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\\*\\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\\*\\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)\n\n**START**\n\nI noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)\n\nIf you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)\n\n[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)\n\nThe results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.\n\n**So, what does this mean?**\n\n**My opinions.**\n\nTo me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.\n\nMy opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.\n\n**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**\n\nAnyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.\n\nI AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR\n\n**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much\n\nI also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of \"correlation does not imply causation\". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **\"strength\"** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term \"significant\" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little \"\\*\" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims \" helps turn food into cellular energy\\*\" while other vitamins make claims with no \"\\*\".\n\nIn layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.\n\nAlso, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.\n\nSo with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.\n\nLastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.\n\nOther than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!\n\n**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.\n\n[u\\/big\\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)\n\nFor those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.\n\n**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**",

On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it&#39;s <em>theirs</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.</p>\n\n<p>I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much</p>\n\n<p>I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot;. <strong>There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation</strong> is a measure for the <strong>&quot;strength&quot;</strong> of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term &quot;significant&quot; is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the <strong>P-test</strong>. The P-test essentially measures the <strong>likelihood</strong> that the correlation between 2 variables is <strong>unrelated</strong>. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little &quot;*&quot; it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims &quot; helps turn food into cellular energy*&quot; while other vitamins make claims with no &quot;*&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In layman&#39;s terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a <strong>.27% chance</strong> that the two are <strong>UNRELATED or a 99.73%</strong> chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I didn&#39;t just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. <strong>Covariance</strong> measures the <strong>direction</strong> of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an <strong>inverse</strong> relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.</p>\n\n<p>So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the <strong>direction</strong> of the relationship, the <strong>strength</strong> of the relationship, and the <strong>statistical significance</strong> of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;ve seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of <a href=\"https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures\">500 dollars</a> per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #2,</strong> The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. <a href=\"/u/big_boolean\">u/big_boolean</a> took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69\">u/big_boolean Graph</a></p>\n\n<p>For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit#3</strong> I&#39;ve started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I&#39;m sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. <strong>Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
