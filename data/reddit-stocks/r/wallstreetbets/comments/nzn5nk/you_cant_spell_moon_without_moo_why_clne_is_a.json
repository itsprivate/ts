Go outside and get some sunlight for once, all this stressing in your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs basement isn‚Äôt doing you any good.  Watching a ticker go up and down for 8 hours a day will make even the most sane apes go insane.   First and foremost, stonks don‚Äôt only go up (especially meme stocks).  There‚Äôs these things called fundamentals, and here‚Äôs why CLNE is actually a good company:\n\n\n- The #1 company in U.S and Canada when it comes providing the cleanest fuel, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)\n\n- Biden all about going green in the future so helps to have the government on its side\n\n- The average analyst predictions have the stock worth around $20, and plenty of room to grow\n\n- Partnership with Amazon that includes delivering 1000 RNG powered vehicles to them, as well as them buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.\n\n- Other deals with major players such as BP, Total SE, and Chevron\n\n\n\n**Why will RNG be the leading fuel for heavy transportation in the future?**\n\n\n\nAs stated, RNG is the cleanest fuel in the world.  If going by GWP, which stands for Global Warming Potential, it has a GWP of 1.1 and that‚Äôs technically carbon negative.  Note, the higher the GWP the worse it is for the environment.  The methane that‚Äôs created from landfills and treatment facilities comes in at a whopping 31 GWP, but that‚Äôs captured and turned into the natural gas all by yours truly.  For comparison, electric has a GWP of 10, and hydrogen has a GWP averaging around 6.  \n\n\nNote: neither of these other competitions (electric and hydrogen) have the infrastructure going forward that RNG has.  Not to mention an electric truck would only be able to drive for around 4 hours before needing to be charged for 3 hours, whereas RNG takes about 8 minutes to fully fuel up.  \n\n\n\n\n**So if it‚Äôs so undervalued, why is the price staying low?!?**\n\n\n\nWell it‚Äôs high of $19.79 (which is a lot closer to its fair value than right now) was back in February but all of EV‚Äôs and green energy sold off back then and it never quite recovered due to no big news.  And the recent couple weeks haven‚Äôt been helping: \n\n\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://imgur.com/a/KoQCrnD) \n\n\n\nNotice how the average volume shorted is around 500k, and when the stock started going up starting 6/3 then it went into the MILLIONS?  And it‚Äôs not just the volume either, the actual % change or ratio shorted went from around 8% to 30%+!!!  On Wednesday 6/9 there were 43 MILLION SHARES SHORTED.  And on Thursday 6/10, 19,135,301 shares were shorted out of a total of 58,606,642 shares traded.  So roughly 1/3 of ALL the trades were just straight up short ladder attacks.  (Note it was 32.6% which is the highest it‚Äôs ever been this year).  Then Friday 6/11, the volume went down but another 4.5 million shares were shorted (which made up 24% of the volume that day) before they even covered the ones from Thursday.  \n\n\n\n**I DON‚ÄôT KNOW HOW TO READ WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN??**\n\n\n\nBig players didn‚Äôt expect $CLNE to gain traction on WSB and made a bet that the price would stay stagnant while they profit off of selling options.  The shorts have doubled down.  Or in their case, quadrupled down.  As stated in my earlier DD, there‚Äôs a potential gamma ramp up that will send this stock to the 25+ if it sits above $13 on 6/18 because of the open interest on calls.  The amount of calls that will be IN THE MONEY is in the millions and only keeps going up.  This means that these big guys will lose BILLIONS of dollars, so they have to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen by shorting the shit out of the stock.  Because CLNE has a smaller float, it‚Äôs pretty easy to manipulate as can be seen in the price action last week.  This means that the MAJORITY of shareholders ARE NOT SELLING and the price action is due to the millions of shares shorted.  They have 2 days to cover, and most start covering AH to not get fucked by calls and also reduce their chances of being pushed out.  Which of course explains why $CLNE starts spiking up as soon as the market closes.  Every damn time.  \n\n\n\n**What does Cramer think of all this?**\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs a stupid question, who cares what that old hag thinks.  It‚Äôs worth noting though that he came out on twitter last week to bash on the stock saying ‚ÄúToday's meme stock is Clean Energy Fuels. Be careful, while i have always liked the company b/c i favor nat gas for short and long haul, the company's had no real revenue growth and almost no profitability in a decade. There will be sellers.‚Äù  But then he interviewed 2 days later being very positive about the company and expecting lots of growth.  Anytime someone like him reverses his opinion so fast, makes me BULLISH as hell.  Also, the company is in more of a growth and research phase right now and could easily be profitable if they wanted to but choose to stay in this phase so that they can take over the whole game later.  \n\n\n\n**So what‚Äôs the play?** \n\n\n\nPretty easy.  Buy shares and hold.  The fact that this stock was at $15 after hours on Thursday shows the buying pressure is there and the people on the other side are scared.  It would‚Äôve been an easy company to profit off of for them but unfortunately CLNE started trending on WSB and now some retarded apes are gonna make them pay.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR**   Read the damn DD if you want some wrinkles, it‚Äôs not long.  Basically the shorts have QUADRUPLED down and want to ride this into this week causing negative sentiment and therefore selling off.  It‚Äôs in the data.  The fact that this company is backed by actual fundamentals and reached 15 AH shows how undervalued it is currently.  Long term gains regardless of how the next few weeks play out, although this week will be very interesting.  \n\n\n\nAs always, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and you must be retarded to take advice from me.  \n\n\n\nPositions\n\n10x 13C 6/18\n\n10x 14C 7/16\n\n500 shares @ 9.50",
