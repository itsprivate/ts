  "selftext": "**TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**\n\nFor background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\\[1\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nMany government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.\n\n**Directly linked:**\n\n1. Social security payments\n\nSocial security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\\[2\\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \\~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**\n\n2) Tax brackets\n\nTax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\\[3\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.\n\n3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n\nThese are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \\~8% of the US federal debt [\\[4\\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.\n\n**Indirectly linked:**\n\n1. Debt interest payments\n\nInvestors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \\~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \\~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.\n\nThere are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.\n\n**Evidence of underreporting**\n\nThere has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?\n\n1. Changes to the CPI formula\n\n\"Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1﻿ Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).\n\nOver the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI.\" [\\[5\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nEssentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of \"increased quality,\" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is \"substituted\" for it.\n\n2) Rent\n\nIn 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\\[6\\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\\[7\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\\[8\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.\n\nWhat do you think? Is the US government massively underreporting inflation?",
