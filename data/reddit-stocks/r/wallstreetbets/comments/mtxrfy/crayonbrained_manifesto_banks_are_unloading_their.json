A passively managed account [explained by investopedia here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp) means the bank or institution will invest your savings ~~as they choose~~ instead of you having full control:\n\n>Passive portfolio management mimics the investment holdings of a particular index in order to achieve similar results.\n\nThis gives them a lot of leeway, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing funds, and \"[fiduciary obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)\" will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??\n\n[from investopedia](https://preview.redd.it/3erffg0840u61.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=24524b7948798f4698b338a66b6903787417dad4)\n\nWell, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future. [As he states here,](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123) **Dr. Brrrrry believes that a market crash is inevitable, inflation will happen, and both b$tco$n and gold will suffer due to governments directly competing with them for currency.**  [He linked to an article here on TIPS,](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) \"treasury inflation-protected securities.\" It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all *and* the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing.  [About 1/5th of **ALL** U.S. dollars currently in existence were printed last year](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm), and the [debt-to-GDP ratio is near its historical high](https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart), having jumped from 107% to 129% *in the last year alone.*  That's *as big of an increase as 2009-2020*\\- all in the last year.  [Margin debt carried by big banks](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) is up almost double from last year and near historical highs, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

[Check out an infographic on all of the world's money here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/) if you want, I can't add that high.\n\nDr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, [source:](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859)\n\n[ApespeeK: dollar go down, bond go down, these go up.  \\(See note above about gold.\\)](https://preview.redd.it/u1w385nmm2u61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=87e6dd430dc6b9dbfbac68f0d1e44766ed703c97)\n\nThe Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, [summarized on this webpage.](https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&typ=a)  Buffet, the guy who says \"our favorite holding period is forever\" and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:\n\n[Q4](https://preview.redd.it/9d9ua5ca93u61.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=88fd4de36663175e21bd70c942b23ede418e2f68)\n\n[Q3](https://preview.redd.it/ooiemmz1a3u61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=674ca1036be24e6900d23064d6cfa67ea4a9873d)\n\n[Q2](https://preview.redd.it/qhcf3wq9a3u61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d9ee0611b537a04349c50e00e2428c98f13208)\n\nHe made some very significant buys as well:\n\n[Q3](https://preview.redd.it/lf5lijkpa3u61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a956765545f46dc863330d55f5262ecae077d24)\n\n[Q4](https://preview.redd.it/yr30x7gva3u61.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3274afb8db2c492103c9b7b0ff6bdf3b4120d16)\n\nHis buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry's table.  His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry's thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct.  *Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.*\n\n# fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.\n\nBiases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how \"risky\" she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.\n\nTurns out her investments are in 60% stocks, **40% bonds.**  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.\n\nDependable, unless you're concerned about a market crash, inflation, and [major dilution of the bonds market.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201)\n\n# BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.  BONDS DEPRECIATE 1:1 WITH THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR.\n\n[This Hong Kong fidelity website does a surprisingly nice job of explaining this further.](https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/start-investing/learn-about-investing/bond-investing-made-simple/how-interest-rates-affect-bonds)\n\n>**\"Often called the ‘enemy of the bond investor’, rising inflation erodes the value of bonds and makes their coupon payments less appealing, if interest rates remain constant or rise.\"**\n\nI then learned that my *husband's* parents employ an independent financial advisor, paid on commission based on their fund's performance.  That advisor had moved his parents' funds *almost entirely out of bonds,* ***and started doing so over four years ago.***  Neither of his parents work any more- they're entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it's not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor *still* made this move *and* went so far as to give his parents a book, [\"Be an Owner, Not a Loaner\"](https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/), explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.\n\nYet here were *my* parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in ***40%+ in bonds.***\n\nIf you check out [J.P. Morgan's retirement guide here,](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/) they actually recommend a portfolio of **60% bonds** if you have \"medium-term goals\" like college or home loans.\n\n[from JP's retirement guide](https://preview.redd.it/hls1v5gxc3u61.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=17cef635a9c36e4de89e239aee4baf7997723298)\n\n[Goldman Sach's retirement guide](https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&rd=n) is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.\n\n[\\\\\"Fixed Income\\\\\" refers to money allocated to bonds](https://preview.redd.it/qebo1tyhd3u61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf99f39a01eb55e1df19a17e42dcebee18fcefb5)\n\nSo.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband's retired parents have their money in the \"highest risk\" portfolio possible.  Which doesn't make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, *especially* if there's a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.\n\nThen I happen to see this news posted: [**3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441)  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.

A passively managed account <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp\">explained by investopedia here</a> means the bank or institution will invest your savings <del>as they choose</del> instead of you having full control:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passive portfolio management mimics the investment holdings of a particular index in order to achieve similar results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This gives them a lot of leeway, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing funds, and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp\">fiduciary obligations</a>&quot; will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3erffg0840u61.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24524b7948798f4698b338a66b6903787417dad4\">from investopedia</a></p>\n\n<p>Well, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123\">As he states here,</a> <strong>Dr. Brrrrry believes that a market crash is inevitable, inflation will happen, and both b$tco$n and gold will suffer due to governments directly competing with them for currency.</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">He linked to an article here on TIPS,</a> &quot;treasury inflation-protected securities.&quot; It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all <em>and</em> the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing.  <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm\">About 1/5th of <strong>ALL</strong> U.S. dollars currently in existence were printed last year</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart\">debt-to-GDP ratio is near its historical high</a>, having jumped from 107% to 129% <em>in the last year alone.</em>  That&#39;s <em>as big of an increase as 2009-2020</em>- all in the last year.  <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics\">Margin debt carried by big banks</a> is up almost double from last year and near historical highs, and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.  The <a href=\"https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/index-quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities.html\">Q4 Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities</a> shows the big banks are currently trading, mainly with derivatives bought on margin debt....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3f7xtrvu53u61.png?width=1472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732cd63bb568a8e4e81c952317e90aaf83a45572\">appendix table 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/agtwece763u61.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4471c8aed1b613dab4c18b85f5a84e8624b698\">appendix table 2</a></p>\n\n<p>Reading is really hard so I had to use my crayons, but that says banks own over $163 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $19 Trillion of assets, and <em>Holding Companies</em> own over $218 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $17 Trillion of assets.  <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/\">Check out an infographic on all of the world&#39;s money here</a> if you want, I can&#39;t add that high.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859\">source:</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u1w385nmm2u61.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e6dd430dc6b9dbfbac68f0d1e44766ed703c97\">ApespeeK: dollar go down, bond go down, these go up.  (See note above about gold.)</a></p>\n\n<p>The Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, <a href=\"https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&amp;typ=a\">summarized on this webpage.</a>  Buffet, the guy who says &quot;our favorite holding period is forever&quot; and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9d9ua5ca93u61.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88fd4de36663175e21bd70c942b23ede418e2f68\">Q4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ooiemmz1a3u61.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674ca1036be24e6900d23064d6cfa67ea4a9873d\">Q3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qhcf3wq9a3u61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d9ee0611b537a04349c50e00e2428c98f13208\">Q2</a></p>\n\n<p>He made some very significant buys as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lf5lijkpa3u61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a956765545f46dc863330d55f5262ecae077d24\">Q3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yr30x7gva3u61.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3274afb8db2c492103c9b7b0ff6bdf3b4120d16\">Q4</a></p>\n\n<p>His buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry&#39;s table.  His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry&#39;s thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct.  <em>Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.</em></p>\n\n<h1>fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.</h1>\n\n<p>Biases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how &quot;risky&quot; she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out her investments are in 60% stocks, <strong>40% bonds.</strong>  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.</p>\n\n<p>Dependable, unless you&#39;re concerned about a market crash, inflation, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201\">major dilution of the bonds market.</a></p>\n\n<h1>BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.  BONDS DEPRECIATE 1:1 WITH THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/start-investing/learn-about-investing/bond-investing-made-simple/how-interest-rates-affect-bonds\">This Hong Kong fidelity website does a surprisingly nice job of explaining this further.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;Often called the ‘enemy of the bond investor’, rising inflation erodes the value of bonds and makes their coupon payments less appealing, if interest rates remain constant or rise.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I then learned that my <em>husband&#39;s</em> parents employ an independent financial advisor, paid on commission based on their fund&#39;s performance.  That advisor had moved his parents&#39; funds <em>almost entirely out of bonds,</em> <strong><em>and started doing so over four years ago.</em></strong>  Neither of his parents work any more- they&#39;re entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it&#39;s not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor <em>still</em> made this move <em>and</em> went so far as to give his parents a book, <a href=\"https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/\">&quot;Be an Owner, Not a Loaner&quot;</a>, explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Yet here were <em>my</em> parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in <strong><em>40%+ in bonds.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you check out <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/\">J.P. Morgan&#39;s retirement guide here,</a> they actually recommend a portfolio of <strong>60% bonds</strong> if you have &quot;medium-term goals&quot; like college or home loans.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hls1v5gxc3u61.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17cef635a9c36e4de89e239aee4baf7997723298\">from JP&#39;s retirement guide</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">Goldman Sach&#39;s retirement guide</a> is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qebo1tyhd3u61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf99f39a01eb55e1df19a17e42dcebee18fcefb5\">\\&quot;Fixed Income\\&quot; refers to money allocated to bonds</a></p>\n\n<p>So.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband&#39;s retired parents have their money in the &quot;highest risk&quot; portfolio possible.  Which doesn&#39;t make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, <em>especially</em> if there&#39;s a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.</p>\n\n<p>Then I happen to see this news posted: <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441\"><strong>3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.</strong></a>  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.  <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever\">This Bloomberg article goes on to explain:</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yp9ofzjhp3u61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82c7c33b46c031c43f0139b68583b06722dd75ed\">https://preview.redd.it/yp9ofzjhp3u61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82c7c33b46c031c43f0139b68583b06722dd75ed</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/fed-to-end-covid-19-capital-break-it-granted-wall-street-banks\">This bloomberg article goes further into the &quot;capital break&quot;</a> that&#39;s now expired.  It includes this fun little bar chart:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hez1vpp6q3u61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c1bef9162a1d940a6feef515bb8d7444531da0e\">Lots of gassy references.  If it&#39;s true that \\&quot;where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire,\\&quot; does that ALSO mean \\&quot;where there&#39;s gas, there&#39;s bullshit\\&quot;??  Discuss.</a></p>\n\n<p>Which led me to remember <em>THIS</em> fun little list from the <a href=\"https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/files/pub-derivatives-quarterly-qtr4-2020.pdf\">Q4 banking derivatives statement</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bk7chzmiw3u61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f6ad09c24f6a9543c65ce7f281db712802d44a\">SACKS</a></p>\n\n<p>Strong correlation between debt over-exposure and the banks that Warren Buffet sold 100% of.  So- why are banks rapidly unloading debt while <strong><em>clearly</em></strong> over-leveraged to debt while <strong><em>keeping</em></strong> debt in their <em>&quot;low-risk&quot;</em> retirement funds?  Fiduciary responsibility my ass...</p>\n\n<h1>TLDR: make your own conclusions based on the facts above.  I will be calling ape-mom and ape-dad about getting their retirement savings the hell out of bonds.</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
