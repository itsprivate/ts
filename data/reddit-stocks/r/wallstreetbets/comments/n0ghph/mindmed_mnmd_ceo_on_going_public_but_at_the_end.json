So take us through what's going in your mind right now?”\n\nJR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we're going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn't just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?\n\nAnd how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we're not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.\n\nAnd so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.\n\n“You mentioned your investor base-- you've got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you're also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what's your take on what you're seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?”\n\nJR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.\n\nI think it's great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We're very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there's been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets. And it's great to have the people behind us.",
