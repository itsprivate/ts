Now I’m a stupid, broke husband and dad of 3 with number 4 coming in early June. I am now going to be Uber driving every night for several hours to try and make ends meet. Yes, I have a job. I’m a realtor in DFW. But I work mostly with buyers looking in the $250-$400K range and they don’t have the cash to pay way over asking to get a home. This is due to so many wealthy folks coming from California that my local buyers can’t compete with in bidding wars. Thus, I’m having my worst year now on my 3rd year in the business despite homes selling like crazy. The only successful realtors right now are those that have been in business many years and get lots of listings. That being said….\n\nHere’s my advice to other newbies like myself for what it’s worth:\n1. Don’t buy short dated calls unless you are 100% ok with losing ALL of it. Get calls months out or even better stick to shares. \n\n2. Even if you’ve done solid DD, and studied solid DD from others, it could still go all wrong. \n\n3. Don’t get over confident based on past success. This was my biggest problem. I’d made some good trades my first few months and felt like I had it figured out. I didn’t know as much as I thought I did, and you probably don’t either. \n\nFollow this advice and maybe, just maybe you won’t end up like me.",
