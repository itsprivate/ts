Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.\n\n**About Them**\n\nMicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.\n\nSumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.[ Source](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d)\n\nWhy have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?\n\n**Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.**\n\nThe reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like \"Wtf is this? I need to get puts\" But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million [equity facility (loan) in December](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html) that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing [Vanguard](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group) and [Blackrock to invest](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock) in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.\n\n[ MVIS \\(left\\) vs PLUG \\(right\\) 1990's until present ](https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63)\n\nAnyways, what is this \"much more advanced\" technology? I'll just let this chart do the talking:\n\n[ The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.](https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8)\n\nThe resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.\n\nThat chart is from 2 years ago and *still* the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the \"[Alpha Prime](https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)\"\n\n>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: \\~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: \\~ 4,800,000 points per second.\n\nVLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost[ $75,000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020). I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime[ costing $100,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiDAR/comments/emp7h4/where_to_get_a_used_velodyne_alpha_prime_vls128/fdqguty?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) That was last year, will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase. They did [announce a $500 model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f) called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its [\"outstanding\"](https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/)... lol.\n\nAs for Luminar (LAZR),[ they will launch the new model \"Iris\" in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/) (the[ same price](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html) as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that **this is unplayable.**\n\n>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.\n\nA[ lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/) has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was \"300dpi/spdeg\", a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here's the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:\n\n>Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of \"**up to** 200 points per square degree\" and a FOV of 120° x 30° (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)  \n>  \n>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1° to 30° , which likely explains the use of \"up to\" in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren't allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.  \n>  \n>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120° x 30°? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120° x 5°? The use of \"up to\" suggests the latter.  \n>  \n>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120° x 30° is available, which is not conceded given the stated \"up to\", that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more \"mechanical\" including, as per a recent patent,[ spindles and a drive belt](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1)  \n>  \n>(1) At video time **19:56**, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar, **Iris**, will support resolution of **300 points per square degree at 10 Hz**. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = **10.8M points per second**. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims **20M points per second** for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.\n\nTLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.\n\nAgain the [MicroVision Consumer LIDAR](http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) ([specifications](http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the \"1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor\",[ will be coming in April](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html).\n\n>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This **equates** **to** 520 points per square degree.\n\n(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn't say **up to**)\n\nIt testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications\n\n>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.\n\nWhat is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4c8831l9dh61.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=0652984c72da3159b53a4fc4058c9d9e33cc6b05\n\nLevel 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology **today**, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced? It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors.\n\n>*I've seen MVIS's LiDAR in action at a shareholder meeting. It can recognize people.

Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies, competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses, healthcare, engineering, military equipment, GPS safety, entertainment, and interactive projectors. They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point, due to grow massively in the near future. Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years. I have never seen a company with such low insider selling, that the last case of a sale was in 2014. Institutional investors are piling in as MicroVision's balance sheet improves and they near the April LRL sensor test date, which has a high likelihood of being a success. I think this stock should currently be valued at 20 Billion dollars, taking all of this into account, and expect it to rise drastically over the next few years.\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, do your own research before believing some retard on the internet.

But what is it? Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Them</strong></p>\n\n<p>MicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that&#39;s used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.</p>\n\n<p>Sumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google&#39;s Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&amp;submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d\"> Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Why have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason they&#39;re so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like &quot;Wtf is this? I need to get puts&quot; But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90&#39;s futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html\">equity facility (loan) in December</a> that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group\">Vanguard</a> and <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock\">Blackrock to invest</a> in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63\"> MVIS (left) vs PLUG (right) 1990&#39;s until present </a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, what is this &quot;much more advanced&quot; technology? I&#39;ll just let this chart do the talking:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8\"> The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn&#39;t even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.</a></p>\n\n<p>The resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.</p>\n\n<p>That chart is from 2 years ago and <em>still</em> the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the &quot;<a href=\"https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">Alpha Prime</a>&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: ~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: ~ 4,800,000 points per second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>VLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020\"> $75,000</a>. I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LiDAR/comments/emp7h4/where_to_get_a_used_velodyne_alpha_prime_vls128/fdqguty?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"> costing $100,000.</a> That was last year, will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase. They did <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f\">announce a $500 model</a> called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its <a href=\"https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/\">&quot;outstanding&quot;</a>... lol.</p>\n\n<p>As for Luminar (LAZR),<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/\"> they will launch the new model &quot;Iris&quot; in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:</a> (the<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html\"> same price</a> as MicroVision&#39;s device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that <strong>this is unplayable.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is &#39;slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,&#39; but that doesn&#39;t mean necessarily that it&#39;s shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/\"> lengthy post</a> has been make comparing Luminar&#39;s resolutions with MicroVision&#39;s, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was &quot;300dpi/spdeg&quot;, a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here&#39;s the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Luminar&#39;s Hydra claims resolution of &quot;<strong>up to</strong> 200 points per square degree&quot; and a FOV of 120° x 30° (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)  </p>\n\n<p>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1° to 30° , which likely explains the use of &quot;up to&quot; in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren&#39;t allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.  </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120° x 30°? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120° x 5°? The use of &quot;up to&quot; suggests the latter.  </p>\n\n<p>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120° x 30° is available, which is not conceded given the stated &quot;up to&quot;, that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar&#39;s specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more &quot;mechanical&quot; including, as per a recent patent,<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1\"> spindles and a drive belt</a>  </p>\n\n<p>(1) At video time <strong>19:56</strong>, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar&#39;s 2022 production lidar, <strong>Iris</strong>, will support resolution of <strong>300 points per square degree at 10 Hz</strong>. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = <strong>10.8M points per second</strong>. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims <strong>20M points per second</strong> for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>TLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.</p>\n\n<p>Again the <a href=\"http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">MicroVision Consumer LIDAR</a> (<a href=\"http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">specifications</a>) being used for comparison here isn&#39;t even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the &quot;1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor&quot;,<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html\"> will be coming in April</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This <strong>equates</strong> <strong>to</strong> 520 points per square degree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn&#39;t say <strong>up to</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>It testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n4c8831l9dh61.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0652984c72da3159b53a4fc4058c9d9e33cc6b05\">https://preview.redd.it/n4c8831l9dh61.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0652984c72da3159b53a4fc4058c9d9e33cc6b05</a></p>\n\n<p>Level 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology <strong>today</strong>, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced? It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I&#39;ve seen MVIS&#39;s LiDAR in action at a shareholder meeting. It can recognize people.

Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies, competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses, healthcare, engineering, military equipment, GPS safety, entertainment, and interactive projectors. They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point, due to grow massively in the near future. Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years. I have never seen a company with such low insider selling, that the last case of a sale was in 2014. Institutional investors are piling in as MicroVision&#39;s balance sheet improves and they near the April LRL sensor test date, which has a high likelihood of being a success. I think this stock should currently be valued at 20 Billion dollars, taking all of this into account, and expect it to rise drastically over the next few years.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, do your own research before believing some retard on the internet.
