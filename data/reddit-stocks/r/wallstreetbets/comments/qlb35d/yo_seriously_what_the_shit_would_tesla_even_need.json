So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... \n\nI've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... \n\nIf Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . \n\nLook I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. \n\nThe question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? \n\nAnother note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.",
