I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.\n\nEdit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.\n\nFrom the SEC regarding this data\n\n>\"The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSEC FOIA Site: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\nData File: [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2xfxx2gyuh61.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d839f263c89c56f782a52803b11c9e5f4c9c8b\n\nEDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.
