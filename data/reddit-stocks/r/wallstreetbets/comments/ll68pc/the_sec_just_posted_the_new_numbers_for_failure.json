I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.\n\nEdit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.\n\nFrom the SEC regarding this data\n\n>\"The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.
