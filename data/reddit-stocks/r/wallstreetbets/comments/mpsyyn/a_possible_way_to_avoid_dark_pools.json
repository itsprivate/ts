  "selftext": "Hey Guys!\n\nOn   March 26th DFV made a few tweets that didn't seem to make sense.    Recently I found out about some stuff that I wanted to share and that I   think DFV was referencing.\n\nHere DFV tweeted the old Flash Gordon logo: [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1375511751748247552](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1375511751748247552)\n\nThen followed up with a cat tweet: [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1375538164425756673](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1375538164425756673)\n\nHere is the wikipedia article for the IEX (Investors Exchange): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX)\n\nThis exchange purports to be an exchange that is friendly to retail investors.\n\n\" IEX's main innovation is a 38-mile (61 km) coil of [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber)placed in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay  adds  a  round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate  the   certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders.\"\n\nAdditionally they created the D-Limit Order to fight High Frequency Traders: [https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw\\_wcB#/121](https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw_wcB#/121)\n\nTL;DR;\n\nI think DFV was saying that by switching to the IEX we could fight Citadel's high frequency trading strategy.\n\nDFV tweeted Flash Gordon a possible reference to the IEX as detailed in   [*Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys:_A_Wall_Street_Revolt) by Michael Lewis\n\nDFV tweeted a cat slapping a drone, which is a possible reference to a Robotic or Trading Algo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkjcvav0ous61.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa09121d0963cc389ff7ae47f517f24fa60b4178\n\nNot trying to piss you off mods.  I got deleted once because I marked it DD, hoping that I got it right this time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 1:  A responder of a cross post gave me this link: [https://iextrading.com/trading/](https://iextrading.com/trading/), it lists brokerages that will send trades to them. Thanks u/TabrisSeele!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2:  Great info by u/loldavelol!\n\nTDAmeritrade offers Direct Order  Routing to the Exchanges. \"Direct Access,\" as TDA calls it, allows you  to select a routing destination for your stock or options order.\n\n**It is a feature that must be enabled. It is disabled by default.**\n\nWhen disabled, all orders on TDA are submitted via [\\[\"Smart Routing\"\\]](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/order-execution.page), listed at the bottom of the page:\n\n>Execution quality statistics provided by S3 Matching Technologies\n\nWhich, if is the same S3 that reports SI, was recently learned to be owned by Citadel [\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2xrj/the_s3_partners_ownership_rabbithole/) & [\\[2\\]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo2811/let_me_tell_you_the_tale_of_s3_partners_a/)\n\nOnce  Direct Routing is Enabled, this allows users to circumvent Kenny G from  poaching orders by routing orders directly to the exchange floor via  IEX, instead of through Citadel and NYSE/ARCA.\n\nThe downsides:\n\n* Orders may not get the best pricing (pennies on the share, TDA quotes savings $1.27 per 100 shares)\n* Might be more susceptible to partial fills (IE: $135 for 10 might fill for 3 until 7 more are found).\n* IEX is also only available during regular market hours, so no access to AM/PM trading.\n\nUnfortunately, on TDA, IEX orders have to be submitted from the Stock Buy/Sell Screen and cant be routed from SnapTicket.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf GME buyers started routing orders from their brokers through IEX then we would ~~apply massive buying pressure to the share price away from the NYSE flow that Citadel Controls~~ bypass Citadel as the MM.\n\nBonus, Citadel sued the SEC after approving IEX as a pathway to the stock market.

Instead, the brokers send the orders to other brokerage  firms like Citadel, or KCG Holdings, which trade against the incoming  orders, and then send the leftovers to other internalizers, dark pools,  or as a last resort, exchanges.\n\nBy doing this, the retail brokers not only avoid paying fees to the  exchanges for active orders, but actually receive payments and trading  rebates from the off-exchange trading venues.\"\n\nAll the brokers we think are clean, are doing all of retail very dirty.
