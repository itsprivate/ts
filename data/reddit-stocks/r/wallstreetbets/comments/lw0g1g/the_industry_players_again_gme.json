Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.\n\nBiggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.\n\nIf you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.\n\nYou also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.\n\nIf you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.\n\nEdit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......\n\nLet me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture.
