I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.\n\nEdit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.\n\nIf you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. \n\nEdit \\^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.\n\nAlso a tip, use the indicator \"Accumulation/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically. Anything under an Accumulation/Distribution Indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock.\n\nThis is not financial advice, I just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future =)\n\nMay God Bless All of You\n\nYour Ape/Retard",
