Clean Energy has sound fundamentals as well as the retail trading hype that gives this stock **🚀EXPLOSIVE🚀** potential in short and long term time frames that entices both ape and boomer alike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CLNE is the largest provider of RNG energy, the most eco friendly alternative fuel.🚀](https://preview.redd.it/acb7exedmb571.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af1535a45cedd3ad206e0a0b4129050f333b660)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreen Energy is a fast growing industry that has attracted 🚀**TRILLIONS🚀** in investments from the international community, firms such as JP Morgan, and us, the common ape. CLNE itself has managed to attract deals and investments from big players recently, most notably Amazon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Not only is this a feel good trade, putting money into companies to make the world a cleaner and more sustainable place, but it also helps us make a quick buck too.\n\n# Financial Statement Analysis\n\nMore on the company itself, a quick look at its financial statements shows us that for 4 years+, CLNE has consistently brought down costs (from about 312m to 230m) to help improve its profit margins. This has also helped it greatly increase their free cash flow, from -41 mil in 2017 to +41 mil in 2020 (for you apes out there, free cash flow is the main indicator of a company's health, and growth like this is what attracts the big boys 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.) These improvements put CLNE in a good position to take **full advantage** of the growth of the renewable energy space.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n#  Comparable Companies\n\nI would like to give you an idea of the potential in this play by comparing CLNE to other popular clean energy plays that we've seen pop recently and why CLNE is better (please note these shouldn't be taken as direct comparisons.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[As you can see, CLNE is best or second best \\(only to TSLA\\) in these key statistics🚀](https://preview.redd.it/o1brevrgmb571.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7563c815299bb67903cce221e17bb440ef74a7b)\n\nIn comparison to PLUG, which famously rose from \\~$4 in April 2020 to \\~$75 in late January 2021, CLNE not only suggests better value from the statistics listed above, but PLUG has failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the way CLNE has been able to. (PLUG's free cash flow declined from -104.5 mil in 2017 to -205.7m in 2020. PLUG operating costs have also gone up from 131 mil in 2017 to 376 mil in 2020)\n\nCHPT, which rose from \\~$10 in August 2020 to \\~$40 in December 2020, has only released 1 quarter of public financial statements. It is worth noting that their free cash flow is -42 mil for Q12021 while CLNE cash flow declined by only 71 thousand for the quarter. CLNE also show better value when comparing the statistics listed above.\n\nI included Tesla for the hell of it, and what's interesting is that Tesla has also struggled to reduce costs, and in many ways CLNE is trading at a discount when you compare some of the key stats I mentioned above.\n\nFinally, FCEL, like many of the other popular clean energy names we've seen here, has also failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the same way CLNE has been able to, and again they are trading at a higher valuation in comparison to CLNE based on the statistics mentioned above.\n\n# Analyst and WSB Sentiment\n\nFor the factors mentioned above, it is no wonder why CLNE has been shown the love its been getting. About 2/3 of analyst list the stock as a \"buy\", with price targets ranging anywhere from $11 (around where its currently trading) to $27. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nThere is the potential for a huge short-term catalyst on 6/18, that will lead to parabolic price jumps should the stock close above $13, putting a shit load of options ITM and forcing a huge amount of buying. Options market also appears to be very bullish on CLNE, with a Put/Call ratio of .12 in today's trading (anything below .5 is considered bullish, so this is mega bull 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) Couple this with the reasons stated above, it is very easy to see why this stock has received so much love for its short and long term potential🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**MR CLNE MR CLNE 🚀💨🐄⛽**\n\n# Positions- CLNE 12c 6/18",
