Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  \nI have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.\n\nMy fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).\n\nAnd yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).\n\n**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41\n\nThe story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!\n\n# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly\n\nThe story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: \"A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return.\" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?\"**\n\nYou are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.\n\n**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65\n\nHowever, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170\n\n, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there‚Äôs no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a üåàüêª, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: \"STONKS ONLY GO UP\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?\"**\n\nYeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2\n\nI am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:\n\n**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? üêª with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.\n\n**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?\"**\n\nPuts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!\n\n[\\\\\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\\\\" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!\"** \\- an ape.\n\nThat's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \\[big part of the revenue\\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:\n\n[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)\n\nAs you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.\n\nAs it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?\n\nThey dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1\n\nAnd soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?\"**\n\nEverything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!\n\nBy buying a big stake of GME \\[12.91% currently\\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.\n\n[Many, but not u\\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)\n\nIt is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‚Äòtraders‚Äô and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a\n\nWhen a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  üåàüêª HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?\"**\n\nDafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  \n\n\n# shortz r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.\n\nApemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.\n\n**\"shortz r lit, hOew can i yoYO my BandaNas ape wAnt SHArT seLl stuCk?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82\n\nOh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. üêª with me, this is the most interesting part.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7\n\nRemember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.\n\nFor now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae\n\nFurthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. –°ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.\n\nFurthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?\n\nMore than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?\n\n**TL; DR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsbyxzcqxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca3cd574a007fa611a3ca3a95dae07cb24f6a613\n\nMeanwhile...  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801",

Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!<br/>\nI have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap<del>e</del> transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using <strong>ELIA</strong>s (<strong>E</strong>explain <strong>L</strong>ike <strong>I</strong>&#39;m an <strong>A</strong>pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).</p>\n\n<p>And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).</p>\n\n<p><strong>LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41\">https://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41</a></p>\n\n<p>The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that&#39;s going to be a ride!</p>\n\n<h1>Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly</h1>\n\n<p>The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: &quot;A <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>fund</strong> is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return.&quot; - The <strong>game</strong> is that simple, thanks, Inve <strong>stop</strong> edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven&#39;t scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be <strong>D</strong>ug <strong>D</strong>eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORT SELLING ELIA.</strong> You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market &#39;ooh ooh ahh ahh&#39;-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? <strong>PROFIT!!!!</strong> (of about 50 bucks)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65\">https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65</a></p>\n\n<p>However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let&#39;s discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable &#39;traders&#39; ( &#39; &#39; marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170\">https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170</a></p>\n\n<p>, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there‚Äôs no one to hold these companies&#39; feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I&#39;m starting to sound like a üåàüêª, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: &quot;STONKS ONLY GO UP&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2\">https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2</a></p>\n\n<p>I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let&#39;s continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:</p>\n\n<p><strong>IOUs ELIA</strong>. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone&#39;s been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? üêª with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called &#39;settlement&#39;. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called &#39;T+2&#39;. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA</strong>. Now let&#39;s imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU&#39;s with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec\">\\&quot;Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\&quot; - Wen Moon.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!&quot;</strong> - an ape.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I&#39;m talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company&#39;s debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales [big part of the revenue] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let&#39;s take a look at the chart of GME:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676\">GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted</a></p>\n\n<p>As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren&#39;t they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you&#39;ve made shit tons of money; your wife&#39;s boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha &#39;trader&#39; (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.</p>\n\n<p>As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the &#39;bankruptcy jackpot&#39; is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic &#39;traders&#39; are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to &#39;help&#39; Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?</p>\n\n<p>They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1\">https://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1</a></p>\n\n<p>And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everything has its time, young padawan, don&#39;t hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, &lt;in Leeroy&#39;s Jenkins voice&gt; RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can&#39;t really call yourself an ape, things don&#39;t work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!</p>\n\n<p>By buying a big stake of GME [12.91% currently], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640\">Many, but not u/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.</a></p>\n\n<p>It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‚Äòtraders‚Äô and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for <em>GME</em>), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word &#39;delivery&#39; into the search of a friendly <em>sub</em>). To conclude on that point:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a\">https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a</a></p>\n\n<p>When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB &#39;traders&#39; understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I&#39;m wrong), and this is where you, honorable &#39;Trader&#39; with capital later, started to outplay the &#39;Big Guys&#39;. Literally, the  üåàüêª HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome &#39;tradering&#39; performance this year, is to buy, and hold.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That&#39;s one whole correctly structured question with no &#39;TrAdEratIon&#39;. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  </p>\n\n<h1>shortz r fuk</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Squeeze ELIA</strong>. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let&#39;s refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what&#39;s hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn&#39;t it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.</p>\n\n<p>Apemeister! Don&#39;t hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that&#39;s a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;shortz r lit, hOew can i yoYO my BandaNas ape wAnt SHArT seLl stuCk?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82\">https://preview.redd.it/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82</a></p>\n\n<p>Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape &#39;trader&#39; again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we&#39;re back to normal. üêª with me, this is the most interesting part.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7\">https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7</a></p>\n\n<p>Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs&#39; YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-<strong>D</strong>epth <strong>D</strong>ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.</p>\n\n<p>For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your &#39;tradering&#39; account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae\">https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae</a></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. –°ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of &#39;traderation&#39;, the &#39;BIG MONEY&#39; YOLOd against you, respectable &#39;trader&#39;, and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don&#39;t know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn&#39;t it?</p>\n\n<p>More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF&#39;s and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fsbyxzcqxjt61.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca3cd574a007fa611a3ca3a95dae07cb24f6a613\">https://preview.redd.it/fsbyxzcqxjt61.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca3cd574a007fa611a3ca3a95dae07cb24f6a613</a></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile...  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801\">https://preview.redd.it/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
