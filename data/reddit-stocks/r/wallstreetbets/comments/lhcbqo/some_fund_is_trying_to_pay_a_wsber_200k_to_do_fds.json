I think we should all apply with a top line comment, and then make fun of the applicants in the thread.\n\nAlso, /u/dhsmatt2 :  your job sucks.   Apply for this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Posting (my comments added in parentheses)\n\n**About Cindicator Capital**\n\nLaunched in 2019, Cindicator Capital is the first quantitative fund powered by Hybrid Intelligence ***(makes you wonder how long it took to come up with that name)***. The fund's set of uncorrelated strategies adapts to different regimes in the digital asset market, aiming to generate returns in bullish, bearish, and sideways trends.\n\nLast year, we’ve built Macro Sentiment Indicators, a tool that tracks the moods of market participants to predict weekly movements of the S&P 500 and other instruments with 70% accuracy ***(So, they've predicted the market with 70% accuracy since 2019... I can do better than that:  Stonks only go up.   That is more accurate than 70% since 2019)***. Now we’re looking for someone to strengthen our trading team and help us build new products. \n\n**About this role** \n\nAs a Sentiment Trader, you’ll be the voice of the millions of traders. With a combination of our qualitative approach to measuring market moods and your ‘street-smarts’, you’ll actively manage our internal multi-million corporate treasury **(so, this job will last you two weeks)**. Then you’ll turn the resulting insights into new features, products, and trading strategies for clients. \n\n**What you should have:** \n\n* 3+ years of active trading experience with both impressive gains and losses; **(we only do one or the other here)**\n* In-depth knowledge of options greeks and indicators; **(this means that they are a constant frat party)**\n* A solid grasp of probability even if you don’t know the theory (i.e. be good at poker); **(they were so proud of themselves for this line)**\n* An active member of r/wallstreetbets with an account age of >365 days and karma of over 1000; **(no prayer threads.   They don't need to take your energy.   They just want FD's.)**\n* Clear, unbiased thinking that defies authority;  **(Don't worry about the first part.   Defying authority.   Check.)**\n* A refined taste for memes and a sense of humour.  **(The fellow kids meme was made for this one)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmsupz3ftrg61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e42e666d8bc1598c1fbaf164dea2d147b162779\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant: NO higher education in economics or finance. Alternatively, prove that you’re free from any mainstream financial brainwash.   **(Numbers are meaningless in this market.   We agree.)**\n\n**What you will be doing:** \n\n* Combining our proprietary Macro Sentiment Indicators with your own research to formulate trading ideas for quant strategies;  **(Don't tell these guys about our secret method of using chickens)**\n* Spending most of your time on Reddit, Discord chats, and Twitter to feel the pulse of the tens of millions of retail traders;  **(Not sure how this is going to be different)**\n* Opening six-figures OTM options trades with the firm’s own capital;  **(THIS we can do.  WAY OTM.)**\n* Trying your best to prevent our risk management from having a heart attack.  **(Good thing they get subsidized medications too)**\n\n**Benefits:** \n\n* $200,000 base salary and a performance-based bonus (30% of the P&L);\n* Remote, flexible working hours;\n* Medical and dental insurance;\n* 50% subsidy for psychotherapy and related medications; \n* After the pandemic is over: parties in Seoul, Korea and St Petersburg, Russia;\n* Optional: a place at a Burning Man camp.  **(For when we burn it all down with GME)**\n\nAs part of your application, please include one trading idea that uses Macro Sentiment Indicators ([https://bit.ly/39Sfa5O](https://bit.ly/39Sfa5O)).  **(We've got to split up these applications.   Some of you can use the chicken method and the others can use the dog method).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to all of you and whoever wins needs to post all trades AHEAD OF TIME.",
