At first I thought this may be a MM, but L2 data and borrow/return times suggest that is was indeed most likely a short HF.\n\nWhat happened today was literally criminal, but I wouldn't hold your breath on the responsible party being held accountable. They are clearly either banking on getting away with it because reporting this is such a pain in the ass, OR decided that whatever fines they would need to pay was worth it. \n\nIt has been a frustrating day, but it appears very little covering was actually done today. With borrow fees over 116%, I wouldn't be surprised to see more violations tomorrow. They are getting incredibly desperate. That said they need to cover at some point with short borrowing fees so incredibly high, and when one large short holder finally decides it's time to cover and starts driving the price up the others will rush in to do the same so they are not stuck without shares to return and fees this high. It's really a game of chicken with shorts buying and selling the same shares back and forth until they meet a real resistance floor (this is why volume is so high, but number if returned shares so low), or one of them chickens out and starts covering enough volume to start real upward momentum. \n\nTomorrow could be pretty explosive.
