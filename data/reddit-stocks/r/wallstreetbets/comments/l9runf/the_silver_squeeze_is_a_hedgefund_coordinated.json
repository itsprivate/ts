I'm simply pointing out that right now, this \"squeeze\" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a \"squeeze\" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet.
