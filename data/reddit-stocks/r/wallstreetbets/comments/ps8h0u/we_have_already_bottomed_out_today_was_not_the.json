Thoughts crossed my mind “why did I buy calls Friday?” “Why the fuck didn’t I buy spy puts?” But the past is the past and here we are.\n\nWhat happened today was a classic overreaction due to Evergrande and their housing debt crisis and had in no way anything to do with the American market. We are still recovering from a major pandemic and have a lot of fuel left in this bull run. Remember back in July when Spy dropped from $435 to $425 over the weekend? The next week it rose back to ATH and ended the week near $440. I predict the same thing will happen here and put us back at $450 by the end of September.\n\nThe only thing that will bring this market down is a full blown nuclear war, another lockdown from covid, or some other catastrophe that none of us will see coming.\n\nYou think America gives a fuck about what happens in China? All we care about is buying a new electric car, getting the iPhone 13, and having same day delivery for our massive green dildos. I for one have been loading up on calls and am buying the fucking dip 🚀🚀🚀\n\nPrepare for Turnaround Tuesday and as always, an obligatory fuck 🌈🐻\n\nEDIT: You guys can all suck my green cock now 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEDIT 2: WEEEEE we’re going down!!! Sold my calls for 50% but we’ll be back up 😈",
