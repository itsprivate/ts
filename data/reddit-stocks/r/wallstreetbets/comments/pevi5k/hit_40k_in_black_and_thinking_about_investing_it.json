Was looking at maybe day trading GME or AMC, those seem to be the most popular. I only need about $1400/month for my expenses and I’m planing on maybe taking out another 20k loan so I can really go all in on this. \n\n\nHere’s what I got:\n40k winnings + 40k I initially bet with\n20k loan from the bank\n10k cash advance on my moms credit card\n\n\nI was thinking an even split on GME and AMC might send me to the moon. My expenses aren’t too bad so I can hold over if nothing is gonna hit just yet plus I’ll have to start paying this cash advance back monthly. Maybe I can get some pointers on other stocks y’all think is worth looking into. \n\nAlso when do y’all think I should pay off the cash advance? Once I’m bringing in the bags I might just pay it off at once.\n\nEDIT: my wife’s boyfriend is actually gonna loan me the 10k so I’ll pay him back interest free. No need to advance on my moms card 🙏\n\nEDIT 2: I’m moving to Vegas, just talked it over with the wife. She said her bf is also moving there too so it’s all falling into place. Y’all are the best ✊\n\nEDIT 3: Talked to my priest (who was the one who set up my wife and her boyfriend) and he recommended I look into investing in alt coins. It allows me to night trade, so that's a huge plus. I also see a lot of influencers coming out with their own coins, maybe I can get there someday. Thanks for the help guys!",
