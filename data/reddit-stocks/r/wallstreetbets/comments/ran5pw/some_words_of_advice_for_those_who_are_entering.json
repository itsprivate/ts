Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn't mean you are going to make that.\n\nRemember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.\n\nNowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don't fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.\n\nPick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch's videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.\n\nNeedless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.\n\nI understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don't know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.\n\nIf you don't know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.\n\nLastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.\n\nTL;DR: Don't invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don't know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.",
