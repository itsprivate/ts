It was the ticker marker. And the shooting star is the stock shooting up in value. So now you’re asking why $62? Simple. The song released in April 13th 2010 and the songs duration is 3:01. But the duration is actually telling us month and days to add from release date. Meaning the surprise valuation is coming exactly on April + 3 = July 14th. Just 3 weeks away. As for the price valuation, it is because it debuted at 62 on the Canadian 100. But y’all may say why Canada? Because maple syrup is delicious. This isn’t a meme stock yall. This is a conspiracy unfolded. Y’all have 3 weeks to buy as much as possible.",
