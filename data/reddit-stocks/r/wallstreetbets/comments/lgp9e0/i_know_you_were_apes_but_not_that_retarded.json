And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?\n\nI'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me.

But guess what?\n\n**I STILL HOLD.**\n\nThis isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.\n\n**This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.**\n\nAnd so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.\n\nFor ONE fucking time in your life - just do **NOTHING** and **HOLD**.\n\nWSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is.
