No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up.

Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money.
