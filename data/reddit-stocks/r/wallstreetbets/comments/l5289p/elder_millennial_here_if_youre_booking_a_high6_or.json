I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.\n\n**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**\n\nYour shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.\n\nWhich brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it.** Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.\n\nNeither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit. \n\n**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said. Thanks.",
