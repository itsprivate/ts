This was a fun ride and it's probably not over yet, but I'm hopping off the train with over a million dollar gain. \n\nHere's the fun part - while I never thought I'd make this much on the trade, when I entered it I promised my Maker I'd give 20% of whatever gains I had to charity and folks affected by the pandemic. I thought maybe it would be $10k or maybe $20k - who knows, $50k if shit got wild. \n\nSo far, post taxes it's around $150k. Wow. We researched charities in our area and I found one that focuses on preventing evictions and helping kids in crisis. We called them this week to tell them what we plan to drop by next week and they were shocked. It costs a lot less to keep a family in their current home than to find them a new one, and in a lot of places, the average eviction is over less than a thousand bucks. They estimate this will keep 100 families in their homes - the majority of whom have kids under 5.\n\nI don't want give up privacy or too many details here and you can ban me for that if you want ( you can see I mentioned this plan in an earlier comment a few weeks ago) , but there are a ton of eyes on this sub and this community right now - let's show the world that we're not the 'dumb money' and we do good when we do well.\n\nI encourage everyone who made bank on this to make a donation to a local charity as there's a lot of need right now.",
