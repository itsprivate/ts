  "selftext": "So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.\n\nShort end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.\n\nLet me explain my thought process. Maybe I'm retarded but you apes help me to see if I'm crazy or autistic.\n\nThe real estate connection begins with this PDF document:\n\n[https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb\\_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf)\n\nCCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.\n\nThe PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.\n\nBut then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.\n\nGamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.\n\nRight underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.\n\nI was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol\n\nBut then I did some other digging and found a random document:\n\n[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0)\n\nWhich is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.\n\nOn page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS & CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT\n\nIdk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.\n\nI looked further into it and found:\n\n[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)\n\n**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC\n\nMelvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.\n\nAnd it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can't find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:\n\n[https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage](https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage)\n\nSo would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop's regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 ([https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/](https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/)) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?\n\nAnd then at that point word got around to Melvin who's probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it's a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?\n\nThen all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they've ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin's hard insider traded tendies.\n\nIt's a cooky theory but plausible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention current position 48 @ $77 ",
