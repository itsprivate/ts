Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.\n\nWhat??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.\n\nThese hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:\n\n[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)\n\nTheir weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.\n\nIsn‚Äôt $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math. I think this will unfold whether or not we take part in it.\n\n**$CLOV Short Interest:**\n\n$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e\n\n[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)\n\nShorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:\n\n* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil\n* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)\n* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July\n* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell\n\n***What does this mean?***\n\nWhat this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \\~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.\n\n**Timing:**\n\nTiming this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any other good news, this would be our catalyst.\n\nTo capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.\n\nInducing some gamma fairy dust so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.\n\nRemember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation √† la Archegos.\n\nObligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Last of all came **the cat**, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally **squeezed** herself in between Boxer and **Clover**  \n>  \n>*George Orwell*",
