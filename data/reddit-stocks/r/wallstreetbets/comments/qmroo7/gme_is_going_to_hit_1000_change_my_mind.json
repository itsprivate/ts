On April 3rd 2020 GME hit 2.57, on sep 22nd it grew by 400% hitting $11.18 Alot of doubters said it couldn't go higher. On December 23rd it yet doubled what it had quadrupled hitting $22.40 Now everyone was convinced it couldn't go up further. On Jan 19th we saw it hit $45.6, Now of coarse it can't possibly go up any further. WRONG again, From here we saw it go up to $159 on Jan 25 and still it continued until it finally hit 483 on Jan 28th. Everybody thought it was going to go back trading below $20 but here we are 11 months later, and it has broken out of a long penant I bet it at least Doubles its all time high! Plus we are seeing daily increases in volume yet volume is lower still than in august but we are above the august bump levels. Huge indicator that we are dealing with a full fledged blue pill RAGER. None of that Chub BS!!!!",
