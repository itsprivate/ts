With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)\n\n:\n\nQ1 2021\tQ2 2021\tQ3 2021\tQ4 2021\n11'531'000\t13'087'000\t14'853'000\t16'857'000\nThis would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.\n\nCalculation market share SENS:\n\nCountry\tDiabetes\tProduct cost\tOperating revenue\tCustomers\tMarket share\nUSA 12.2020\t30'000'000\t99\t10'016'000\t101'000\t0.3%\nUSA 12.2021\t30'000'000\t99\t16'857'000\t170'000\t0.5%\n​\n\nI tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.\n\n​\n\nCountry\tDiabetes\tProduct cost\tOperating revenue\tCustomers\tMarket share\nSwitzerland\t500'000\t99\t250'000\t2'500\t0.5%\nGermany\t9'500'000\t99\t4'700'000\t47'500\t0.5%\nItaly\t3'300'000\t99\t1'630'000\t16'500\t0.5%\nNetherland\t1'300'000\t99\t640'000\t6'500\t0.5%\nPoland\t2'300'000\t99\t1'130'000\t11'500\t0.5%\nSpain\t3'600'000\t99\t1'780'000\t18'000\t0.5%\n​\n\nWith this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year.
