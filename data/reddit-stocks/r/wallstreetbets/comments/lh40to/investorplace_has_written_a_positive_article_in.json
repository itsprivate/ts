In the past two weeks, we've been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We've even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.\n\nFor those who don't want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from r/WSB are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.\n\nPlease read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we're a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen's leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we're diamond hand apes! \n\nAlso to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they're tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We're not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I'm down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won't have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn't raise no quitter! To the diamond hand gang, don't lose hope!",
