Every single one of us has walked into a GameStop at least once and bought a game we were excited about. Our little brothers and sisters would beg us to take them there to buy the 80th edition of Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/whatever. We've all perused a Game Informer, hoping to see a 10 rating.

Go read about these assholes if you want to put a smile on your face, knowing what they're dealing with right now. I hope Gabriel Plotkin has to sell his $40 million Miami mansion (he just bought it in December). Hell, I hope Ryan Cohen buys it from him.\n\n\n**Positions**: Half my Roth IRA in GME shares.
