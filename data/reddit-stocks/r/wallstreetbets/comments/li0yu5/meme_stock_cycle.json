You nerds can't just go by numbers or info about the company. This is human behavior and computer algos programmed by humans.\n\nSo let me lay out what happened with SNDL (and most meme stocks for that matter)\n\nEarly Adopter Phase - This was when SNDL was under $0.5 recently. People who suspect the stock is undervalued and a lot of bigger money investors are loading up. The stock may trade relatively flat or go through small increases.\n\nMiddle Phase - 01/28: SNDL spikes up to 100%, before closing the day up about 39% at $0.83. Very high volume on the day. This is where people who are watching for activity get in (I bought here).\n\nLate/FOMO Phase - 02/08: SNDL spikes roughly 14% and goes into a stage of parabolic gains as retail buyers rush in and FOMO takes hold. Word spreads like wildfire across social media and forums. Everybody is aware at this point.\n\n\\*Short sellers know how this works as well and they will enter positions at some point during this phase\n\nProfit Taking Phase - After a few days of huge gains on very high volume, buying reaches a crescendo. The earliest adopters have already made several times their initial investment and are ready to cash out. The people who bought in the middle know that the \"smart money\" has either already sold or is about to sell. This leads to chain reaction of increased selling. Fear can take hold over the Late Adopters as they do not want to lose money and panic sell.\n\nSet for next cycle - The stock usually drills hard, followed by some more selling and/or a dead cat bounce if the drop is too drastic. Over the next trading sessions, price will go through smaller up an down bounces until a new \"baseline price\" is found. The stock will usually trade sideways for a bit until the cycle begins anew. (This last part is hard to predict). Stocks may see very little activity for weeks or months in this phase, or buyers may quickly regain interest, especially if a catalyst appears.\n\nThis isn't WSB doing this or the media or whatever grand conspiracy you think it is. It's happened many times and will continue to happen\n\n**Edit**: Decided to scoop up some APHA, TLRY, and SNDL from the panic sellers during premarket. There's no \"set\" way to determine it, but I felt that all of these got \"oversold\" by the panic sellers. Retail usually buys high and sells low, be different.",
