People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free\n\n2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork\n\n3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)\n\n4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) \n\n5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it \n\n6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible\n\nThat's all I have to say.
