I, for instance, will only tell when asked, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure.\n\n\n**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**\n\n1. People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free\n\n2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork\n\n3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)\n\n4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) \n\n5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it \n\n6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible\n\nThat's all I have to say. Have a quiet cigar or champagne when you do cash out (above $1000 of course), or come up with some other excuse as to where the money came from. \n\n\nGME and BB to alpha centauri 🚀🚀🚀 Godspeed bois\n\nEdit: please also consider giving a portion of you funds to a charitable cause to make the world better in many ways",
