Like a sensible \"investor\" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking \"what's the fastest way I can make my money back?\". Selling puts of course. \n\nSo I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up. \n\nPOSITIONS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n16hgoiteag61.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bab8d0e4a152406f91d2f50402a6d8ab94143c",
