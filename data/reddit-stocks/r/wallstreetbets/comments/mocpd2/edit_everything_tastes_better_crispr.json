If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any *edits* (no pun intended).\n\nThe next post will be about their current drug pipeline. This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10-k's, licensing agreements, court filings, and a lot of adderall. \n\n**Intro**\n\n**What is crispr?** Crispr stands for **c**lustered **r**egularly **i**nterspaced **s**hort **p**alindromic **r**epeats. It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes.\n\n**Why should I care?** Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century, and [received a Nobel for its discovery last year](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/). It's not an understatement that in the next coming years crispr will impact just about every part of our lives. It's not just me saying this.[ Bill Gates \\(poured in $100M\\)](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/bill-gates-thinks-gene-editing-artificial-intelligence-save-world/), and [momma Cathie](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/editas-stock-price-ark-cathie-wood-genomic-stocks-driving-returns-2020-12-1029911942) believe that this is one of the most revolutionary things of this century. [Joe Davis of Vanguard found the idea multiplier to be similar to how the internet took off](https://advisors.vanguard.com/e-assets/articles/FAS008905/Todays-ideas-in-genetics-and-biomedicine-are-multiplying-quickly.png).\n\nIf you cannot see this can change the world crispr could help [by eliminating that extra chromosome you probably have](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28633863/#:~:text=CRISPR%2FCas9%20genome%20editing%20can,to%20delete%20an%20entire%20chromosome.&text=show%20proof%2Dof%2Dconcept%20for,embryonic%20stem%20cells%20and%20zygotes). \n\n**Editas ($EDIT)**\n\nEditas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders (in vivo), and for various forms of cancer (ex vivo). \n\n\nTheir business model is actually pretty smart. They're targeting rare diseases for drug development, and licensing out the IP for crispr. Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable, and easier to develop. You essentially can monopolize a disease, and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up. The IP though is going to be the breadwinner. Essentially **any drug developed with crispr will give an 8%-13% royalty to $EDIT**. Not to get too technical, but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary, and [far exceeds anything else on the market](https://imgur.com/a/RHVZ6Wn). [They estimate they can target about 95% of the human genome.](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/node/8291/html) \n\n\nOne drug of note in their pipeline that is of interest is EDIT-201. EDIT-201 is essentially engineered T cells with CARs and Engineered TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells. This is an interesting treatment solid forms of cancer. This could potentially be an alternative, or complementary to chemotherapy. The collaboration is with Juno Therapeutics (acquired by BMY) who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources. Others include sickle cell, usher syndrome, and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials.\n\n\n**The patent**\n\n$EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute. There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent. This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close. [To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). But, there is a consensus slowly [forming that $EDIT will acquire the patent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/latest-round-crispr-patent-battle-has-apparent-victor-fight-continues). The winner for the patent will easily make billions off of the IP.\n\n\n**The catalysts**\n\nBiotech has a lot of catalysts. It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon. In the short term there's drug trials. [A notable YOLO came from one of our very own with just shares where he turned $12k into $322k in a week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kahcek/account_was_at_12k_last_week_and_i_expect_to/). Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference. On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT-301 trial, and then [put out a press release](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-preclinical-data-and-large-scale) which caused the stock to go from $33-$99 the following weeks. **This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares, or LEAPs are the safest choice**. The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials. \n\n**Positions**\n\n100 @ $23.56\n\n10 $50c 4/16\n\n1 $53c 4/16\n\n20 $60c 4/16\n\nI am long on shares, and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer. I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI have a degree in molecular bio, and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years. A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private. Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non-humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market.\n\n**TL;DR**: One of the most disruptive things ever only has a $2B market cap. Your chance to get on the rocket before it goes to the edge of the observable universe \n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**EDIT**: There's some confusion over the ticker. The ticker is literally $EDIT. The next posts will cover the other 2 companies.",
