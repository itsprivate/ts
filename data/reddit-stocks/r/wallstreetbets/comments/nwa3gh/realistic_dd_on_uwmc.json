The reason for this is simple: it’s a GREAT company.\n\nHere are just some highlights of upcoming catalysts:\n\n1. Increasing short interest, 55% over the past few weeks. Despite the stellar performance over the last few days short interest went up.\n\n2. Resilience to short attacks. Through the day there were several obvious short attempts to pull the down the stock but UWMC recovered instantly each time. This demonstrates an enormous pool of buyers with eyes locked.\n\n3.
