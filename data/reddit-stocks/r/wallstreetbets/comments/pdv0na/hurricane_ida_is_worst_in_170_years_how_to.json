  "selftext": "Okay fellow apes.\n\nHurricane Ida is mere hours away from hitting the coast of Louisiana. It surprisingly strengthened as it neared landfall and is now a Cat 5 hurricane, recognized by the governor as the \"strongest storm\" since 1850, even worse than Katrina. It went from a tropical depression on Aug 24th to a whole hog cat 5 hurricane this morning. Most people didn't have any time to warp their brains around how quick this happened, if you're in New Orleans please gtfo asap.\n\nPossible Trades :\n\n1- A bunch of offshore drilling takes place in the gulf and with a storm this destructive, production will take a hit. Companies already cut 60-90% of production and shut down offshore facilities in the gulf. oil futures are already up. You can leverage this by buying calls on SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF $XOP or playing the levered oil ETF $GUSH.\n\n2- People run out to buy a whole lotta stuff from generators to plywood, sandbags, batteries, flashlights etc. You can leverage this by buying calls on Home Depot $HD,  Lowe's $LOW and Generac Holdings $GNRC which sells generators. All three popped after hurricane irma and harvey in the past.\n\n3- People tend to need to rent a whole lot of stuff during and after big storms like this, from cars, to equipment and machinery. You can leverage this by buying calls on the AVIS Budget group $CAR and United Rentals $URI which rents out all sorts of equipment and gets a boost from every hurricane season as well. These popped after major hurricanes hit last 3-4 hurricane seasons.\n\nBest potential moves :\n\n1- Oil seems like it's going to be the biggest play, as \\~40% of all oil production and refining takes place in and around the gulf. \\~92-88% of oil and gas production in the gulf of Mexico is already shut down as of yesterday and storm damage will inevitably limit future production which means a spike in oil prices. I'll be looking for a good entry to $XOP and potentially open call spreads 2-3 weeks out and cash out at a spike in oil prices any day within that timeframe. If you can trade futures options, might be a good idea to buy calls on crude oil and oil products.\n\n2- $URI and $GNRC could see a sizable swing in the weeks following the storm, they nearly always do after big storms, so keep your eyes peeled on those. These could be good for a monthly call or call-spread position.\n\nNOTE: Spambot kept deleting my post for \"spam domains\" even though they were all legit local news sources, so I removed all links.",
