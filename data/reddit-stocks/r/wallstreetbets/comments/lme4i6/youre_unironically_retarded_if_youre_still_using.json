This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.\n\n**Access to penny stocks**\n\nEver want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.\n\nI wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.\n\n**Actual customer support**\n\nI haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.\n\n**Instant transfers**\n\nAgain, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. \n\n**Huge assets under management**\n\nVanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.\n\n**Cool desktop/web apps**\n\nWanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1. \n\n[Stolen from google images](https://preview.redd.it/kco97ssy16i61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb7623017890bb5a0ea17d471ea54bec64c0f19)\n\n**Cons of not using Robinhood**:\n\nI'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood. \n\n\\- Looks cool\n\n\\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)\n\n\\- Easy to use\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, do yourself a favor and use a real broker :)",
