I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results.

Good luck, retard.\" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.\n\nAnyways, TL;DR: My doctor said \"good luck, retard\" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.\n\nDiamond hands, Covid neg, TO THE MOON WE GO!",
