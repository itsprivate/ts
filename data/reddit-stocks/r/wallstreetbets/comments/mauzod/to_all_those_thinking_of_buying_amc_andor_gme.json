It actually hurts the value of the stock when people sell, and those who have paper hands tend to sell.\n\nSimple economics teaches that an objects value is based on supply and demand.  If there is a high demand for something that has a short supply, the value goes up for that object.  In other words the more we buy and hold, the less supply there will be.  When the hedgies and market movers need to buy shares to cover their shorts and options, the demand for these shares will shoot up, and the value of the stock will shoot up as well, because we are holding on to the supply.\n\nWhen people sell their shares, they are providing more supply that drives the value of the stocks down.  That is why it is imperative that people who are currently buying these stocks HOLD.  We need diamond hands in this fight.\n\nAfter reading that, you think that there is too much risk involved and want to invest more wisely, there is nothing wrong with that. You are actually helping us by realizing that now. That just leaves more shares for the diamond hands to buy.\n\nAfter reading that, and you believe you are ready to join the fight, then welcome to the Ape Army.
