Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/articles\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.\n\nEdit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.” \nHeavily supports my points made, felt like it’s important.",

Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. &quot;China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month&quot; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html\">From this article</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today&#39;s price.</em> <strong>Retail has no control my ass</strong>. Lets take a look at this:</p>\n\n<p>A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood&#39;s API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we&#39;re looking just at ownership.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e\">Source: Robintrack.net</a></p>\n\n<p>The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That&#39;s 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. <strong>This is ONLY on Robinhood</strong>. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it&#39;s pretty reasonable. It&#39;s speculation based on prior data. &amp; if users really are 23m, that&#39;s even crazier. Here&#39;s math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, <strong>add all of the other brokers</strong>. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, <em>other</em> brokers ownership percentage probably isn&#39;t <em>as</em> high, but it&#39;s still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">If average # of shares per person is</th>\n<th align=\"left\">% of RH users that owned the most popular stock</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Total shares owned on RH</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">730k shares</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1.46m shares</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3.65m shares</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">7.3m shares</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">7.3m shares</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14.6m shares</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The <strong>total market capitalization</strong> of the <strong>U.S. stock market</strong> is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47\">Source: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17</a></p>\n\n<p>It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. <em>Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.</em></p>\n\n<p>So why does retail &quot;not control the market&quot; ?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. <strong>Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn&#39;t control the market?</strong> Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here&#39;s insight into mine.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Retail isn&#39;t coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can&#39;t coordinate things like the elite can. We can&#39;t dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can&#39;t control the media narrative because we don&#39;t own/aren&#39;t in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn&#39;t control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. <em>One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do</em>.</li>\n<li>Information <strong>IS</strong> becoming a commodity, there&#39;s just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it&#39;s difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. <em>They ARE terrified of retail</em>. The potential for &quot;power&quot; to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I&#39;d be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"/u/alice_oe\">/u/alice_oe</a> made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.” \nHeavily supports my points made, felt like it’s important.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
