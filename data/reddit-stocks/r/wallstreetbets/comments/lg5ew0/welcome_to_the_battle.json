I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.\n\nWe cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.\n\nThis is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)\n\nBUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that.

We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.\n\nMy logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.\n\nWell hedgies... I SAY:\n\nFUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! KARMA IS A BITCH. TRUST ME. I'VE MET HER. THERE'S NO RUNNING FROM IT. I'VE PAID FOR MY SINS TENFOLD, EVEN WHEN I LAUGHED SAYING ALL OF THAT KARMIC BS WAS  JUST THAT... BS.
