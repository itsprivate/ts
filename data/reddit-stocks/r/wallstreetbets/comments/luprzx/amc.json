On Friday, we also saw a call option volume of over 300,000 contracts meaning that hedge funds/sellers of these contracts will need to buy 100 shares per contract in order to hedge the position. This is how a gamma squeeze is formed. Through the massive amount of buys for this particular share. \n\nOn top of this AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market with a short interest similar to GameStop’s. It is also one of the most active stocks in terms of daily volume. With that said, AMC had potential to form a short squeeze on top of the gamma squeeze that is going to occur this upcoming week. This has the potential to his not $10, $20, $30 per share but above $100 per share if we all hold our shares. There will be information put out to scare us into selling. There will be ladder attacks to bring the price down. But all we have to do is hold. \n\nHolding this stock will force hedge funds and those shorting the stock to buy at whatever price we are willing to sell for. If we all hold we win. There are now over 9 million members of this group and we all feel as though we have been wronged by actions on Wall Street and the constant manipulation of prices. But this time we will win. We hold we win it is really that simple. Let’s make history together.",
