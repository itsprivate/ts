If this is true it only leaves 30 million shares to be traded on the market, but this is greatly reduced because of the Gamma squeeze on Friday. Due to the amount of calls that ended up ITM (all of them) roughly 10-15 million shares will be tied up until Tuesday according to other other DD I saw posted here tonight. \n\nWhy is this important? This leaves roughly 15-20 million shares actively trading which is an extremely small float for the volume. This will make any moves far more extreme than usual. This is further reduced by the 💎 ✋ 🐂 here who own approximately 8-10% of shares this amounts to about 7 million shares. If we assume half of us will not sell Monday and provide liquidity, there will be 11.5-16.5 million shares being traded. \n\nAny price movement will be extreme Monday higher or lower. News can swing this stock into triple digits or back down to 20$(extreme example not going to happen).  So if shorts get margin called Monday expect the price to accelerate rapidly higher.  There is also the possibility of another gamma ramp up if too many retards buy far OTM calls, but dealers will likely have something up there sleeve to prevent a repeat of Friday \n\n\nThis is not financial advice in any way.\nI also have a long position of 130 shares at 18$ cost basis. \n\n\nTLDR GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",
