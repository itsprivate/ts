My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of \"investing\", I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I'd always think let's enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I'd want to cash out a bit. This isn't even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. \n\nI came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn't rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???\n\nIf 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren't actually allowed to make money?\n\nEDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!",
