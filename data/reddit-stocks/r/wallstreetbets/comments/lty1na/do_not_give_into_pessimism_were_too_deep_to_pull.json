At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand.
