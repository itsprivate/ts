  "selftext": "Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs, innovations in marrying satellite technology to low-earth orbit (\"LEO\") applications, and advances in LTE network architecture.  We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.\n\nInside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there \"is a there, there\" in terms of what we are playing for here.\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE**. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs. ASTS' actual mobile solution - your existing handset\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Haha - let's get back to business...read on](https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b)\n\n$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone\n2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications\n\nHere is the overview of the **FACTS**\n\n**PRODUCT:**\n\n• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices\n\n• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use\n\n• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks\n\n• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device\n\n**MARKET:**\n\n• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed\n\n• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation\n\n• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected\n\n• Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions\n\n• The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters\n\n**MANAGEMENT:**\n\n• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)\n\n• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs\n\n**COMPETITION:**\n\n• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect\n\n• ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones\n\n**OTHER:** Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing.  The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\n• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  • 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024\n\n**ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT**\n\n• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business\n\n• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’\n\n• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘**big idea**’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets\n\n• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU\n\n• The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set-up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk\n\n• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing\n\n• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n• While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed\n\n• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement\n\n• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution\n\n• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk\n\n**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment**\n\n***BUSINESS MODEL***:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow\n\n***GO-TO-MARKET:***  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024\n\n***DEFENSIBILITY***: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market\n\n***CAPITAL***: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation\n\n***TRACTION***: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite\n\n***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \\~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user\n\nBelow are projections:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q78k3rkk6k571.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d03a94e2c9ae9c58e278e62d613cbf19d02dee8\n\nWhen thinking about a hypothetical valuation, I pro-forma the numbers and apply a multiple in-line with the tower companies.  I treat depreciation as a real cash expense\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp15x4om6k571.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb6a1526b293fc54c82ed510c351f8288b69a1b\n\n**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**\n\n***OVERVIEW***: AST & Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones\n\n***BOOMBOX IN SPACE:***  ASTS’ satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **“loud”** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones\n\n***SOFTWARE:***  ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible\n\n***BACKHAUL***:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum\n\n***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area\n\n***WHAT DO WE KNOW***:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?\n\no *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years\n\no *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system\n\n***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs\n\nA launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days\n\n***BENT PIPE***:  The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing\n\nDISCLOSURE: I own 500,401 shares of common. Yes, this is a huge position. You only live once...invest carefully and with great vision.  To avoid accusations of being a shill, below is proof of my position.  I'm grateful for the moderators working with me so that I can meet the requirements to post!  I have a new appreciation for the depth of validation they require.\n\nI don't want to test my luck, but I have a bunch of cool memes to share later...made them while passing those long, cold days when this stock seriously sucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Proof of life \\(or future death if this investment doesn't work\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xyq67h3p6k571.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&s=981c4fb304754aeec4ffe3416055839e19594b73)\n\nSame account from mobile phone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tz7oz0ur6k571.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ed58161df770aaf3f907e02ead30b9a11ae7cd7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some trade lots for further proof](https://preview.redd.it/cugjotqs6k571.png?width=309&format=png&auto=webp&s=145dfab9a474127880916d636f06bf2678f47253)",

We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.</p>\n\n<p>Inside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there &quot;is a there, there&quot; in terms of what we are playing for here.</p>\n\n<p>Just like Facebook found out after it&#39;s IPO, the real market is and always will be in <strong>MOBILE</strong>. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink&#39;s mobile solution vs. ASTS&#39; actual mobile solution - your existing handset</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b\">Haha - let&#39;s get back to business...read on</a></p>\n\n<p>$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what&#39;s possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone</li>\n<li>By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers&#39; ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here is the overview of the <strong>FACTS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRODUCT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and <strong>only</strong> space-based cellular broadband network that is <strong>direct-to-device</strong>; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices</p>\n\n<p>• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks</p>\n\n<p>• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device</p>\n\n<p><strong>MARKET:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected</p>\n\n<p>• Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions</p>\n\n<p>• The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters</p>\n\n<p><strong>MANAGEMENT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)</p>\n\n<p>• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs</p>\n\n<p><strong>COMPETITION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones</p>\n\n<p><strong>OTHER:</strong> Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company&#39;s latest financing.  The Company&#39;s own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIMELINE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  • 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024</p>\n\n<p><strong>ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and <em>bone fide</em> strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business</p>\n\n<p>• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’</p>\n\n<p>• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘<strong>big idea</strong>’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets</p>\n\n<p>• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU</p>\n\n<p>• The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set-up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk</p>\n\n<p>• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing</p>\n\n<p>• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company</p>\n\n<p><strong>RISKS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• While the <em>BlueWalker</em> satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed</p>\n\n<p>• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement</p>\n\n<p>• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk</p>\n\n<p><strong>INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BUSINESS MODEL</em></strong>:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT&amp;T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>GO-TO-MARKET:</em></strong>  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DEFENSIBILITY</em></strong>: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CAPITAL</em></strong>: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>TRACTION</em></strong>: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the <em>Bluewalker 1</em> test satellite</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>FINANCIALS</em></strong>:  With a market cap of ~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user</p>\n\n<p>Below are projections:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q78k3rkk6k571.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d03a94e2c9ae9c58e278e62d613cbf19d02dee8\">https://preview.redd.it/q78k3rkk6k571.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d03a94e2c9ae9c58e278e62d613cbf19d02dee8</a></p>\n\n<p>When thinking about a hypothetical valuation, I pro-forma the numbers and apply a multiple in-line with the tower companies.  I treat depreciation as a real cash expense</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xp15x4om6k571.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fb6a1526b293fc54c82ed510c351f8288b69a1b\">https://preview.redd.it/xp15x4om6k571.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fb6a1526b293fc54c82ed510c351f8288b69a1b</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY DETAILS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>OVERVIEW</em></strong>: AST &amp; Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BOOMBOX IN SPACE:</em></strong>  ASTS’ satellites are ~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large <strong>“loud”</strong> system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>SOFTWARE:</em></strong>  ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BACKHAUL</em></strong>:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CAPACITY</em></strong>:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>WHAT DO WE KNOW</em></strong>:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?</p>\n\n<p>o <em>Bluewalker1</em> proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. <em>Bluewalker1</em> allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years</p>\n\n<p>o <em>Bluewalker3</em> (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>RISKS</em></strong>:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, <em>Bluewalker3</em> could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs</p>\n\n<p>A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BENT PIPE</em></strong>:  The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing</p>\n\n<p>DISCLOSURE: I own 500,401 shares of common. Yes, this is a huge position. You only live once...invest carefully and with great vision.  To avoid accusations of being a shill, below is proof of my position.
