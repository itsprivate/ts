PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀\n\nWARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.\n\n[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉\n\n\\------------\n\n**Part 1: FINRA**\n\nI put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))\n\n(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)\n\nThere was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.\n\nThe short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.\n\n**CAVEATS:**\n\n* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t\n* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.\n\nHere are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.\n\n**Assumptions used:**\n\nGME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)\n\nGME Total Shares: 69,750,000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aiojjnfc4xj61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=23ab48804b920e09037598bbe30aa23320a77602\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvoxzk2c4xj61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=f883c3c654d4d66b7aa49c8f2a3bb880e7e8bf71\n\nThe FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ni4jdui7xj61.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeb4d3129a8adff4bdedc2188d38241b3d29f2c9\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**\n\nTwo other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.\n\nThe data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).\n\nNote: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ym6xo8jb4xj61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1d69f7f809df0160a8d723d14a7be9f39006bc3\n\nHere we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 3: ETFs**\n\nThis data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.\n\n[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)\n\nDoing some quick math of \\~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \\~1.1m GME shares shorted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7csw01b4xj61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad278b02ec5894b983ee12c62e22ee03a06eeb57\n\n[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)\n\nThey have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).\n\n>“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”\n\nIf these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares). \n\nNOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF\n\n\\----------\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nTHEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!\n\nStake: shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**\n\n\\----------\n\nShoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https://www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https://www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post which I have incorporated.\n\n\\----------\n\nFor those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:\n\n\"The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled \"Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,\" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbp82yca4xj61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d84055dc1f1edc92e7d3be0365fb6d14de2d61",

THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF &#39;CONFIRMATION BIAS&#39;. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it</a>, so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this <em>light</em> weekend reading 😉</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1: FINRA</strong></p>\n\n<p>I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! <a href=\"http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html\">http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html</a> (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily\">https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily</a>)</p>\n\n<p>(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day&#39;s file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)</p>\n\n<p>There was an additional <strong>22 million</strong> in short volume today, on top of the <strong>33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday</strong>. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.</p>\n\n<p>The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at <strong>57</strong>% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CAVEATS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to <a href=\"/u/tri_fire_engineer\">u/tri_fire_engineer</a> for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that <strong>once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke</strong>t</li>\n<li><strong>daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,</strong> as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered &#39;shorting&#39; but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn&#39;t sound very fun.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions used:</strong></p>\n\n<p>GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)</p>\n\n<p>GME Total Shares: 69,750,000</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aiojjnfc4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ab48804b920e09037598bbe30aa23320a77602\">https://preview.redd.it/aiojjnfc4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ab48804b920e09037598bbe30aa23320a77602</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zvoxzk2c4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f883c3c654d4d66b7aa49c8f2a3bb880e7e8bf71\">https://preview.redd.it/zvoxzk2c4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f883c3c654d4d66b7aa49c8f2a3bb880e7e8bf71</a></p>\n\n<p>The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at <strong>60.35%</strong> ( <a href=\"http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0\">http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0</a> ) Thanks to <a href=\"/u/wrek\">u/wrek</a> for sending this!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ni4jdui7xj61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb4d3129a8adff4bdedc2188d38241b3d29f2c9\">https://preview.redd.it/4ni4jdui7xj61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb4d3129a8adff4bdedc2188d38241b3d29f2c9</a></p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: Borrowing Shares</strong></p>\n\n<p>Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.</p>\n\n<p>The data available through iborrowdesk.com (<a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a> ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site (<a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/about\">https://iborrowdesk.com/about</a> ).</p>\n\n<p>Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ym6xo8jb4xj61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d69f7f809df0160a8d723d14a7be9f39006bc3\">https://preview.redd.it/ym6xo8jb4xj61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d69f7f809df0160a8d723d14a7be9f39006bc3</a></p>\n\n<p>Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from <strong>2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate</strong>! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on <strong>Jan 27</strong> when we saw some huge intraday price swings.</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: ETFs</strong></p>\n\n<p>This data of course doesn&#39;t take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, &#39;EX AR TEE&#39; is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/\">https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/</a></p>\n\n<p>Doing some quick math of ~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = ~1.1m GME shares shorted.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7csw01b4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad278b02ec5894b983ee12c62e22ee03a06eeb57\">https://preview.redd.it/i7csw01b4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad278b02ec5894b983ee12c62e22ee03a06eeb57</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/\">https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/</a></p>\n\n<p>They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that&#39;s a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares). </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT <strong>💎🙌</strong> 💎 will prevail!!!</p>\n\n<p>Stake: shares in GME <strong>🚀</strong> <strong>🚀</strong> <strong>🚀</strong></p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p>Shoutouts to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/\">u/RicFlairsCape</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/\">u/Rrrrandle</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/\">u/CultureCrypto</a> for some good suggestions on the last post which I have incorporated.</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p>For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled &quot;Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,&quot; which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gbp82yca4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d84055dc1f1edc92e7d3be0365fb6d14de2d61\">https://preview.redd.it/gbp82yca4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d84055dc1f1edc92e7d3be0365fb6d14de2d61</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
