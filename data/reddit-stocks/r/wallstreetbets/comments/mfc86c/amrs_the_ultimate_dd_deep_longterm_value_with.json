Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAmyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs\n\n***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\nI believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.\n\n[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nI was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term\n\n**$AMRS BUSINESS:**\n\nThis business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)\n\n$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model\n\nIn the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)\n\nIn the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages\n\n$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/0i2sigct5up61.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5adddb33f2fba374819bb1a7978567d539de69d)\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/elg9yw6i7up61.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6aa48fdd57967c48d2474a2db7975fde4f63e98)\n\n**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**\n\nNo doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon\n\n[John Doerr Ownership \\/ Other Investments](https://preview.redd.it/zq3bts856up61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ac19937f3e728e1761e8b26a513ce6b35f0138)\n\n**SHORT INTEREST:**\n\nAs shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock\n\n[Source: FactSet](https://preview.redd.it/zaj7ak6l6up61.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee15407674b13c2d45207fde230d9654f18f54ff)\n\n**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**\n\nBeginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**\n\nThe first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**\n\nHere is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)\n\nThe CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)\n\nTo those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the \"efficient market\" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThese strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more\n\n***The play: $AMRS shares + April 16 calls with strikes $20 and above***\n\nGood luck and godspeed",

Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. <strong>Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&amp;D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. <strong><em>Within the next three trading days,</em></strong> <strong><em>$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.</em></strong> This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>MY POSITIONS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e\">Positions</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term</p>\n\n<p><strong>$AMRS BUSINESS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health &amp; Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor &amp; Fragrance. Within Health &amp; Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor &amp; Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)</p>\n\n<p>$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model</p>\n\n<p>In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand\">JVN</a> (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership\">Rose Inc</a> (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production\">Minerva</a> (focusing on zero carbon protein production)</p>\n\n<p>In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including <a href=\"https://biossance.com/\">Biossance</a> (high-end skincare), <a href=\"https://pipettebaby.com/\">Pipette</a> (skincare for babies), <a href=\"https://purecane.com/\">Purecane</a> (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products\">Teresana</a> (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer\">Costa Brazil</a> (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics\">made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines</a>, though this is in its early stages</p>\n\n<p>$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. <strong>It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0i2sigct5up61.png?width=1693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5adddb33f2fba374819bb1a7978567d539de69d\">4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/elg9yw6i7up61.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6aa48fdd57967c48d2474a2db7975fde4f63e98\">4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>No doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zq3bts856up61.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ac19937f3e728e1761e8b26a513ce6b35f0138\">John Doerr Ownership / Other Investments</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORT INTEREST:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zaj7ak6l6up61.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee15407674b13c2d45207fde230d9654f18f54ff\">Source: FactSet</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. <strong>The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction\">$50 million</a> and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. <strong>The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba\">4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021</a></p>\n\n<p>The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) <a href=\"https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations\">as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25</a></p>\n\n<p>To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don&#39;t care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS&#39;s investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it&#39;s incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the &quot;efficient market&quot; fantasy world, the company&#39;s public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The play: $AMRS shares + April 16 calls with strikes $20 and above</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Good luck and godspeed</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
