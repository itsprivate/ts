On a slow day, as they were rounding a corner near a square, an IED was triggered sending the humvee into the air and catapulting him 60ft. They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.\n\nAfter a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, i showed him r/wallstreetbets and the dd that people were doing on the gme stock. He YOLO'd his savings and sold half at 302,giving him enough to pay off his mortgage! E talk everyday, and he just got an amazing job 2 weeks ago doing R&D in his major. He is focused, heavily invested in gme, and doesn't care what the price does. He likes the stock , and the community here have been encouraging and uplifting.\n\nTHANK YOU ALL!!! you may not think you have an impact s an individual, but this is about more than just stocks. It is about people!\n\nTo the moon!!!\n\nEDIT: I can't believe the love and support! I tried to respond and thank everyone for the awards and kind words, but can't keep up, so thank you all! I've got mad respect for my fellow apes!",
