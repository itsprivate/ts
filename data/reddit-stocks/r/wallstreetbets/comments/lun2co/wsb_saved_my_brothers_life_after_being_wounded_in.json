He YOLO'd his savings and sold half at 302,giving him enough to pay off his mortgage! E talk everyday, and he just got an amazing job 2 weeks ago doing R&D in his major. He is focused, heavily invested in gme, and doesn't care what the price does. He likes the stock , and the community here have been encouraging and uplifting.\n\nTHANK YOU ALL!!! you may not think you have an impact s an individual, but this is about more than just stocks. It is about people!\n\nTo the moon!!!\n\nEDIT: I can't believe the love and support! I tried to respond and thank everyone for the awards and kind words, but can't keep up, so thank you all! I've got mad respect for my fellow apes!",
