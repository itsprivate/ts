(Thanks [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pointandfigurechart.asp)!)\n\nA point-and-figure chart plots price movements for stocks, bonds, commodities, or [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) without taking into consideration the passage of time.\n\nContrary to some other types of charts, like [candlesticks](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/), which mark the degree of an asset's movement over set time periods, P&F charts utilize columns consisting of stacked X's or O's, each of which represents a set amount of price movement. (1% in this chart) The X's illustrate rising prices, while O's represent a falling price.\n\nTechnical analysts still utilize concepts such as [support and resistance](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/), as well as other patterns, when viewing P&F charts. Some argue that support and resistance levels, as well as [breakouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp), are more clearly defined on a P&F chart since it filters out tiny price movements and is less susceptible to [false breakouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failedbreak.asp).",
