Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds.\n\nMy goal is to ***own GameStop***. As absolutely much of it as I possibly can, while I am alive and on this planet.\n\nBecause of this, I *want* GME shares price to go down. Whether this occurs due to algo-driven price suppression or organic selling-off of shares. The more the value drops, the more shares I can afford to buy.\n\nobligatory: Not financial advice. I like the stock. I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this.\n\n-------------------------\n\nHere are the facts:\n\n1) **Mark Cuban raised a very valid point.** \n\nIf you are investing in a company, the way we *used* to, as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company, then prices going down is a good thing. Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion. \n\n2) **GameStop is poised to d.o.m.i.n.a.t.e. the space within the gaming industry.**\n\nLooking to build Esports arenas? Guess what, gyms are going out of business left and right. Cheap real estate.\n\nDedicated gaming streaming channel? Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches, so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming, would be no surprise. I'm not talking about livestreams, I'm talking about *produced* content.\n\nSpeaking of live, Twitch? Discord? Already set up, and instead of competing, GameStop could literally just *buy* these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord (or leave them as is, just own the revenue streams).\n\nThere are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub (epicenter, really) for such a massively exploding industry (an industry with zero sign of slowing down. Ever). \n\nEntertainment as an all-things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable, and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly. *Interactive* entertainment is just unrivaled.\n\n3) **The man, the legend, the boyfriend to all of our wives, DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr. G, just doubled his shares position.** He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock, and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values (remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up? I didn't do the math, and I'm not gonna, but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100% of those profits into shares anywhere near the top).\n\nBecause of this, he has negative downside risk (GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead). I'm in a much *much* smaller, but similar boat. I made $100K, and kept 100 shares, which I fully intend to take to my grave. This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place.\n\n4) **GameStop will never be forgotten.** This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time. The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon. Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes, the world will always *always* remember \"G.M.E.\"\n\n5) **I am just fine, financially.** My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue. This is not a YOLO play. I can afford to lose the money I am putting in. Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance. See above, where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist, so there's no money anyway.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n- Buy *as many shares* as I can afford, never expecting to see that money ever again.\n\n- Sell a few covered calls way in the future, at or out of the money. As they approach expiration, roll them forward another year. This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops, or secure (and yes, limit) upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value. As long as these options do not get exercised, I will still own the shares. I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25-35% cash ROI every year (see below somewhere).\n\n- As I earn more money externally, buy more shares. Again, as many as I can afford. Every. Single. Year. Just constantly expand my position. No matter what. Forever.\n\n- ????\n\n- Profit, never. Not ever sell a single share. Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to, you guessed it, buy more shares.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, my goal here is to own shares, not to make money. Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares. Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares.\n\nCurrently at-the-money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 (about a year out) are effectively worth 35-40% of the value of the stock. Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY, then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35% each year. Yes, there will be a decrease in IV in this case, but using externally-earned money I should be able to make up the difference.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n- **First milestone:** overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume. I will never beat his % gains, and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns, but that is fine. My goal is purely share count. \n\n- **Second milestone:** overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume. My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares. I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type \"ryan cohen gamestop shares\" and I'm not gonna. Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated. I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone, as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life, before I get old and die.\n\n- **Third milestone:** Own, run, and manage GameStop. Whatever that means. Member of the board, sure? Bust in on meetings like \"Hey I own most of this place, someone grab me a coffee.\" and then yell about how \"I pay your salary!\" as I'm being escorted out by security, more likely. But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table, even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old, or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWith this strategy, cumulatively expanding my position by 35% YoY, I should be able to turn a 1,000-share portfolio into a 8million-share portfolio in 30 years. This is just based on current prices, options values, and my current income.\n\nIt couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1, $0.50, or $0.25 per share. At a certain point, cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock.\n\nI like this stock, and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **only** disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan (it's not even a strategy at this point), would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised, calling all my shares away from me, increasing my net worth by 35% all at once. \n\nOr if GME just does really well organically, which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares.\n\nBecoming a millionaire would be cool and all, but I'm trying to do something specific here.\n\nSEC interns: I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone. I just like the damn stock.\n\nHedgies and MMs: please crank up your algos to maximum. Never stop doing what you're doing. I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY.\n\nCurrent ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ shareholders: you are the only thing standing in my way, and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme-ass prices. If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits, I will thank you for it. If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it (maybe shoot for buying back in lower), I'd appreciate that even more.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually, whatever. Might be a little bit to get started, as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better. But hey, I have 30 years to get this sorted out, right?\n\nMake fun of me as I lose money. Ask me for advice as I make money. Call me an idiot for the platforms I use. Try to sell me access to your crappy web-based indicator research tools. None of it will matter. Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin-toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable, I suppose.\n\n**tl;dr - there is no tl;dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates**",
