If you want a detached house that's not a meth den, you need to either : be making 6 figures, be a mega-frugal buzz-kill for years, have rich parents, or have a very successful only fans. But here's where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:\n\n* googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit\n* I've done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc\nLogo and website cool **ape brain engaged**\n* i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.\nI bought in last December and on multiple occasions I've had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i'll just be house poor for 25 years.
