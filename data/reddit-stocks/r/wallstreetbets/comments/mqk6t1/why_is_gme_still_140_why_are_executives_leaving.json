For those who did not read the tweet, eliminating debt removes the restricted ability to issue dividends. (they can do it now). At the same time, Gamestop is simultaneously searching for someone well versed in smpyto. I can't link the articles but it is easily findable online. How does that play into this?\n\nClearly there are potential uses but the immediate usage may be different. For this we will examine the case of [Overstock.com](https://overstock.com/), ($OSTK) which held a long battle with the shorts.
