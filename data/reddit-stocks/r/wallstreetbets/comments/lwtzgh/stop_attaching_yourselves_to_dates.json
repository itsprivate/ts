Seriously. There was this mass belief among those of us long on GME (and I should know, I believed in it) that SO LONG as the ticker closed above $320 on Friday, we would wake up Monday morning to the squeeze of all short squeezes.\n\n\nAnd Monday morning in pre-market and all during the day we look at the stock, and lo and behold, the MOASS happened, and every single person who ever bought GME sold it for a price greater than $1000, and world peace was realized because the wealth had been redistributed through the markets for the first time in history.\n\n\nNo. It began the fall down to $40, which it finally hit towards the end of the month. Sure, it’s back above $100 per share, but that date was wrong and dangerous and a lot of people lost a lot of money.\n\n\nLook, I’m long on GME. I believe there’s a possibility of a short squeeze. But the cultier the message becomes, the more ANGRY people are that other tickers are mentioned:\n\n\n>RKT is just a hedge fund attempt to distract people from GME, just like SLV was.\n\n\nThat’s a great point, buddy. Say, have you looked at their charts? Do you understand the fundamental difference between the mortgage industry and a ticker that purports to be backed by actual silver but isn’t?\n\n\nOh, and let’s talk about the gross overestimation of WSB’s power. It is literally impossible for this subreddit to P*mp and D*mp. Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it’s because they’re riding that train, not conducting it. No P*mp and D*mps are baked into the rules. Do you not trust u/zjz? What’s wrong with you. The market cap on tickers mentioned here has to be above a certain number to explicitly prevent p*mping and d*mping.\nDon’t believe me?\n\n\nWhy isn’t PLTR at 50 then? No, seriously, why has it never hit $50 per share. They had a great earning last week. All over the subreddit people said it would hit $50.\n\n\nIn fact, if WSB is so damn important and powerful, how come GME spent almost an entire month below $60 per share in February?\n\n\nToday could be a very good day. It could also be a very bad day- for whatever tickers you are invested in.\n\n\nThere are lots of great reasons to be long in GME outside of a potential short squeeze, and I personally think the stock is undervalued until it reaches a price of close to $200 per share, but I also think it will be incredibly volatile before that.\n\n\nI also think it won’t earn that price target organically for two to three years. I think Ryan Cohen can successfully transform the company, and that’s why I’m long on GME.\n\n\nSo, rather than convincing yourselves that you know everything, that it’s all going to work out in a specific way at a certain date because of THIS INFORMATION, why don’t you relish in the fact that you don’t know. Because I certainly don’t. I don’t know anything. I’m a fucking idiot who makes financial decisions based off of gut feelings and the things I’ve read on a subreddit filled with other idiots.
