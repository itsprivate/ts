There could be more.  I need some people less retarded than me to check my math on this.\n3.\tTomorrow I’ll buy GME calls – even deeply OTM. Weeklies could be fine. Go further ou if you don’t want the risk. EDIT: as u/StarSwitch taught me, ATM calls and calls closer to share price will cause MMs to cover it with shares. So calls up and down the call chain are muy bueno and shit.  \n4.\tAll fucking hell may break loose on Thursday morning. The NYSE reports short position at market close on Wednesday.  Some analysts are quietly saying that shorts could be 300-400% of the float now. \n5.\tI’m already in on GME shares (over 1700) but I’ll buy more. (Positions at bottom of post)\n6.\tEVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.\n7.\tGME momentum is going to create a massive upward feedback loop. The combination of options gamma squeeze, available float, and short interest makes it impossible for shorters to escape.\n8.\tNormally, shorters deep underwater could hedge their losses by buying call options.\n9.\tBut buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze. It’s like fighting against quicksand for the shorters.\n10. This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest.\n11. This could be bigger than the VW/Porsche infinity squeeze. But it’s completely different from VW – so don’t draw too many comparisons.\n12. This squeeze could happen without Papa Cohen action but if Cohen does anything soon then GME is going to uncharted territory somewhere in another universe (forget the moon or some other place in this universe.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME Position: \n\n[Fuck you Melvin](https://preview.redd.it/803jawkihdd61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=64d7edd5da0e7740fb666288b82ea500e82b356c)\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry about the video link.
