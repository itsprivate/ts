With industry average of 4.5 times revenue, WISH is trading far below with industry average. \n\nWish is one of the largest and fastest growing global ecommerce platforms and even assuming 4.5 times, it should be trading at $24.\n\nIn addition, with economies reopening it will be easy to facilitate shipping and will favourably impact WISH. In addition, low income group which were adversely impacted will be back.\n\nMoreover company is diversifying out of China and partnering with local stores to drive product sales. The company already has more than 50,000 local stores in 50 countries (like Brazil and Mexico and other Latin America and Europe) and company is planning to expand in Africa. This will continue growth in new markets to drive more revenues.\n\nAs you can see there are lot of tail winds for this stock and it can easily muti-bagger at this dirt cheap price. \n\nYou don’t make money without patience. Just buy and hold and let compounding do it’s magic.\n\nWISH went through several rounds of raising capital through equity financing with company valuation way north of $10 billion.
