I think there's a lot of opportunity for growth from many angles, just based on the industry alone. I feel like we're kind of maxed out as a society on creating original movies. I don't believe that we can just continue cloning sequels and remakes like the Hollywood's been doing for the past 10 years. Video games on another hand are becoming more and more immersive and are equally fun and story-rich as movies, some may argue even better.
