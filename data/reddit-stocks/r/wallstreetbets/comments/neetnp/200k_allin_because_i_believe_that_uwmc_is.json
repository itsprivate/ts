The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.\n\nDuring    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.\n\n**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**\n\nThe     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.\n\nAnd     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.\n\n**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**\n\nAs     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.\n\n**Then in answering a question from an analyst**\n\nDoug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?\n\nMat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**\n\nTL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.\n\nDisclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is a CAD portfolio look at the USD info at the bottom](https://preview.redd.it/xs8qibn3aoz61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e96140f603f5a61bfc6cbdcb64d311f0c63756e)",
