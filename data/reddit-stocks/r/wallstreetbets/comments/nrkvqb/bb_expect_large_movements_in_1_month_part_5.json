We haven't even lifted off yet, but we certainly are close.  \nThe majority of shares were traded at open, this means a large portion of people are sitting $18-$20 USD and will likely be accumulating more on this dip if they are wise.  \nTomorrow's expectation stands. The range will anywhere between $24.75 USD to $33 USD but it is impossible to tell at this point in the game.\n\nOther things I would like to point out on the chart is whenever we've had large openings we have a strong tendency to trade lower than we opened.  \nThis is of the recent bull (crab) run:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jelbb1nak3371.png?width=2549&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3e31a9e8bc046d78f8ca6f24fbb2f0164e1090f\n\nThis is the bull (crab) run from January\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phbd015bk3371.png?width=2555&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcb1c3ab94b26124fe35e28f17f07748ad5aa18\n\nSo what I'm trying to say here is, don't be scared of the short term from what you see at open and what happens the rest of the day.
