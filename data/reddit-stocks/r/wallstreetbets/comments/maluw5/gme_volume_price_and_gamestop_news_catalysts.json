  "selftext": "Now that witching is behind us, we can look ahead to a real catalyst. I'm sure a lot of you have seen me post most of this in the daily threads, but it would be nice to get this some real visibility ahead of Tuesday:\n\nJust a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.\n\nLast 2 big news catalysts?\n\n**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.\n\n3 day action around that announcement:\n\n03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330\n\n03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**\n\n03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670\n\n\n\n**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.\n\n*4* day action around that announcement (edited to include the 25th since the news dropped post-market on the 23rd):\n\n02/25/2021 Open: $169.56 Close: $108.73 Vol: **150,308,800**\n\n02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: **83,111,740**\n\n02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215\n\n02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020\n\n\n**Price Action following these news catalysts:**\n\n[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)\n\nHere's how closing price trended around these two announcements:\n\n2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**\n\n2/24 - Close: $91.71\n\n2/25 - Close: $108.73\n\n2/26 - Close: $101.74\n\n3/01 - Close: $120.40\n\n3/02 - Close: $118.18\n\n3/03 - Close: $124.18\n\n3/04 - Close: $132.35\n\n3/05 - Close: $137.74\n\n3/08 - Close: $194.50 - **Committee announcement pre-market**\n\n3/09 - Close: $246.90\n\n3/10 - Close: $265.00 - **Day's high: $348.5 - flash crash attempt**\n\n3/11 - Close: $260.00\n\n3/12 - Close: $264.5\n\n\nAs you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.\n\n**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** \n\n**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)\n\nFollowing that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.\n\n*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.\n\nFor those that want to dial in:\n>2020 earnings results after the market closes on Tuesday, March 23, 2021. The phone number for the investor conference call is 877-451-6152 and the confirmation code is 13715567.
