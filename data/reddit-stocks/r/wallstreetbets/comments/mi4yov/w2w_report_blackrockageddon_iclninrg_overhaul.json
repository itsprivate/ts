This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world‚Äôs largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    \n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äú...oh...um...okay. Whatever?‚Äù  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn‚Äôt been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**\n\nSo, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg\n-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.\n\n[I found a document from SPDJI called a ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. \n\n[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)\n\nSo, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**‚Äîthe underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**\n\n****\n\n**Investment Firm Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings‚Äîwhat BlackRock‚Äôs gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)\n\n>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.\n\n>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand‚Äôs Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.\n\n>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil‚Äôs Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.\n\nWhoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**\n\n**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. \n\n**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.\n\n**What we‚Äôre pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. \n\n**What we‚Äôll do**: Next week we‚Äôll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. \n\n****\n\n**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I‚Äôll have more picks.\n\n*Quick note: I actually put this in my newsletter sunday and wasn‚Äôt going to put it here, but GM is eating away at my conscience. Consider this my mea culpa.*",
