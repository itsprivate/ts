This lets us estimate the price per share as people jump off at different points on the way up, which is expected, everyone has a different price point, just as different sell points are expressed.\n\nGeometric mean is basically an average of numbers that have exponential growth. For Apespeak, Bananas that grows more bananas as you eat them. You take the Max share price you expect, and then the current shareprice, and you calculate the Geometric Mean. This article explains it better than I can, I just am a retarded ape that loves crayons with colors out of space.\n\n[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:\\~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio)\n\nFor argument's sake, we are going to use 150% short, so 75 million shares that need to be covered. The numbers below are the peak Price per Share, Total Payout of GME, and overall price per share for the payout. So without Further ado\n\n1k per share price total payout would be $33,525,000,000 @ 447 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n5k per share price total payout would be $75,000,000,000 @ 1000 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n500k per share price total payout would be $750,000,000,000 @ 10000 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\n20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 @ 63245 per share (Geometric Mean)\n\nTLDR: In summation, it's really not as much as a payout as you think, regardless of its Peak. So you might say \"Hey wait! X price is too damn much! We'd bleed the world dry and awaken Elder gods!\" And I say, \"Nay fair Ape, you'd only cause Azathoth to roll over. There will still be a world left to enjoy your tendies. Even at 20 mill per share.\"\n\n🦍🚀🚀🚀🦍🚀🚀🚀\n\nFull credit goes to [u/Raught19](https://www.reddit.com/user/Raught19/) since he can't post here.
