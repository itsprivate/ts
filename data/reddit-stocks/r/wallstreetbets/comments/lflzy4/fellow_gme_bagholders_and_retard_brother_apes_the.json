Those who have been here longer than a month know that you win some and you lose some. But sometimes we hold onto our positions with hope, either to bath in the tendies of our good fortune, or to move on and learn from our mistakes for the next time. That’s what it means to be 💎🙌\n\nRecently, this sub has been attacked by some nasty 🐷💩 From my own investigation, these 🐷 are new members who are ignorant of the history of r/wallstreetbets and the glorious losses of our forefathers. These 🐷 lost a lot on GME and panic sold, most likely for massive losses. They have now chosen to plug the sub with their stinky shit and let their negativity seep into your hard earned positions. Don’t let them. \n\nThis is also not a jab at new members. I love new members. More retards joining this hive of scum and villainy brings tears to my eyes. But please read the guidelines and educate yourself before FOMO YOLOing into certain loss and panic selling. And only put in what you can live without. Or do what you want, I’m not your fucking daddy. \n\nWhat I really want to say is that if you intend to hold GME/AMC, don’t let the 🐷s mentally fatigue you and force you to sell. You’ll only end up becoming one out of spite. Take a break from the sub, we’ll hold the line while you go take a piss. We could all really use a nice long piss. \n\nPositions: Holding strong, 39.5 shares GME @ $99.88, 1 800c 2/12, and 15 shares AMC @ $11. \n\nTL;DR: don’t let negativity from 🐷💩 be the reason that you sell for a loss. Let them say what they want to say, who gives a fuck, they’re losers anyways. If it begins to bother you mentally, TAKE A BREAK from the sub and keep holding!\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nAlso, not financial advice.\n\nEDIT: clarifying points, IF YOU FEEL LIKE SELLING, don’t let the reason be 🐷💩. Make up your own minds and do your own research.",
