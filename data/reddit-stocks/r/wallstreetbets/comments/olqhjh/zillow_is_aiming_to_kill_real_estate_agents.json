That's what realtors want in this market.  3% for the buyer's agent, 3% for the seller's agent, and all they have to do is take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet.  It's galling.  You have a $500k house and want to sell it?  Well, not without paying $30k to some shithead with an MLS account!  And it only gets more galling the richer you get.  The transaction cost on buying and selling homes is just really, really fucking high when you use an agent.\n\nAnd Zillow knows this, and they know people are sick of paying realtors $3,000-$10,000 per hour to sell their homes.  \n\nToday, I just sold an investment property to Zillow.  They offered me the Zestimate (their own pricing model which is publicly available on their website), which is great because it's how I valued my house anyway.  People are always on Zillow looking to see what shit costs, and they just offered me what they said the house was worth. \n\nThey charged me about $10k in seller concessions to for repairs and shit, which is higher than you might pay normally, but this is directly in line with my own estimations for what I would have needed to do to sell the house.\n\nFinally, they charges .1%.  POINT ONE PERCENT as a transaction cost.  So at the end of the day, I got exactly the price I expected, I didn't have to deal with anybody's bullshit (buyers, agents, showings, cleanings, contractors, staging, pictures) and I basically did the whole thing online.\n\nTheir tech is also very good.  Smooth docusigning, good customer service, even remote/Zoom notary services.  \n\nThey are going to spruce this house up and then they are going to sell it on their own platform to another buyer.  Even if they don't make a profit, what they just did is FUCK TWO TO FOUR REALTORS out of their commissions.  \n\nIt's like Sony taking a loss on their hardware to get market share.  This is how Zillow is going to win.  It was easier and cheaper and I dont' feel slightly fucked.  But realtors are fucked.  I think Z has earnings on 8/5.  I'm thinking about an option play but I don't know.  My wife bought like 15k of their stock for a long term hold in her roth, so that's all we've got for now.  What do you think?",
