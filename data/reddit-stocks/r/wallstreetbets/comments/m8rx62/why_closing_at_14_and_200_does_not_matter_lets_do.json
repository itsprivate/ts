  "selftext": "**why closing at $14 and $200  DOES NOT MATTER** Facts not FUD\n\nI see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn’t have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) \n\n**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That’s NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner\n\nThis is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you’re watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. \n\nOn to the options component of our class - \n\nObviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I’m going to try a practical approach.\n\nUse the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went “oh well looks like I’m short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.”\n\nOF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That’s the “gamma squeeze.”\n\nAs people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!\n\nThere’s all sorts of slightly technical reasons there’s small overhangs at 4:00 but it’s mostly done. \n\nSecond practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear “if the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.” And it doesn’t. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren’t the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don’t you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?\n\nOptions markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what’s happening in stocks (Ie earlier this week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There’s slightly more to it (you can look up “pin risk” and “Max pain” if you’re interested I’m trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.",
