It's a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far far far fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. \n\nIf RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over. \n\nPositions: [Take what's yours, gents.](https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo)",
