Typically, settlement is on Tuesdays. I've read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM last Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. \n\nPlease note that **none** of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now even **fewer** shares to be borrowed. There are estimates that the true short interest on this stock was around 300%. Now, with about 20% of the total float **committed to the fucking clearing house** as they sort out Friday's shitshow, I expect true short interest is closer to 500%. \n\nDemand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. This is a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far *far* **far** fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. \n\nIf RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over. \n\nPositions: [Take what's yours, gents.](https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo)",
