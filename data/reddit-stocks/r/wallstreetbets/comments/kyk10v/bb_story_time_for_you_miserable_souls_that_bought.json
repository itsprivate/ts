Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato‚Äôs cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into 3/19 6c‚Äôs on the DD that: ‚Äúwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there‚Äù ... that‚Äôs it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn‚Äôt. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5‚Äôs to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn‚Äôt penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo‚Äôs and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it‚Äôs just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy‚Äôs) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it‚Äôs really fine. Look at what‚Äôs happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don‚Äôt know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race üçé‚Äîit‚Äôs huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God‚Äôs work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city‚Äôs, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I‚Äôve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand üíé ü§ö BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I‚Äôve trimmed half the options, I don‚Äôt even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I‚Äôm riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette‚Äôs syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO‚Äôs jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they‚Äôre a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally ‚Äúfree money‚Äù \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands üôå\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",
