This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit.

The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.\n\nMoving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since /u/zjz ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence.
