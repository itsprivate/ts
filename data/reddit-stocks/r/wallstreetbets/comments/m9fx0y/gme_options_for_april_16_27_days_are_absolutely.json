Someone please look at the options distribution for 4/16 and tell me what you think it means.\n\nFrom Fidelity's option chain table: PUTS EXPIRING 4/16/21 in order of Open Interest quantity and including dollar values if ITM - NOTE these are just dollar values of the shares if exercised, it is not the dollar value of the CONTRACTS representing the shares. I need to eat more wax fruit to unlock options math level 2.\n\n\\-50 cent strike - OI of 58,862 - $2.94m\n\n\\-10 dollar strike - OI of 33,581 - $33.58m\n\n\\-5 dollar strike - OI of 29,438 - $14.71m\n\n\\-1 dollar strike - OI of 18,839 - $1.88m\n\n\\-40 dollar strike - OI of 17,686 - $70.74m\n\n\\-50 dollar strike - OI of 15,606 - $78.03m\n\n\\-20 dollar strike - OI of 14,464 - $28.92m\n\n\\-3 dollar strike - OI of 11,098 - $3.32m\n\n\\-30 dollar strike - OI 10,876 - $32.62m\n\nall the rest are under 10k contracts OI, with the top being the 7 dollar strike with an OI of 8,444 - representing 5.9m USD worth of shares if ITM\n\nhonorable mention due to dollar value - 200P 4,048 OI = $80.96m\n\nThis is where it gets wack, because the calls are all anticipating a moon, but do not have anywhere close the open interest of the puts despite having very similar dollar values if ITM. The 800C far outstrips any others with a whopping 15,581 OI ($1.24 BILLION WITH A B worth of shares if ITM), the next highest being the 400C at 4,582 OI ($183m if ITM), and all the others (100,200,300,500, etc.) have roughly 4k OI or less.\n\nIs this the day of reckoning??? If hedges were betting Ch. 11 filed by April 16 that represents 353.6 million dollars worth of shares now ITM, no telling how much was paid in premium to acquire those. The value of the top 2 call strikes (If GME were 800+) represents a quadruple return over the 353m if GME were at zero.\n\nWhats the alternative? Based on this, it seems to me like they are going to ride this squeeze and cash in the options and make a profit 100x what any retailer will -*from their own mistake*\\- and the manipulation over the last few months is what enabled it. My gut tells me that most retailers dont have the cash to mess with options in these quantities due to IV spiking premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think is more likely now - the puts go out of the money and the calls print, hedge funds make fat $$$ off recent their recent big bet to acquire tons of high strike calls... OR Hedges original bet of GME hitting zero was actually correct and the puts print? This does of course mean that GME must hit $800/share or higher for the options to be cashed in...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot financial advice as I cant read or write.",
