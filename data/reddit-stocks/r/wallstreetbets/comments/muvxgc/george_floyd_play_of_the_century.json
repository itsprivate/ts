Regardless of how you feel about that, there is an opportunity to make massive amounts of money.\n\nEveryone here except maybe the 7+ million members who joined since June 2020 remembers the [massive protests that took place](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) when that event first went down. These protests largely started out peaceful, but many escalated into violence targeting local businesses. One of the most targeted businesses during these events was CVS (ticker $CVS). [CVS got his so hard they were forced to close some locations!!!](https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-closes-some-stores-looting-protests-2020-6) Let's look at what happened to CVS stock over the same period of time:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[See that Drop???](https://preview.redd.it/jr83oz706du61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=a464465a4ed3279cac2c39dfd8063576aa82dcd6)\n\nYou guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on! So what does this have to do with the trial??? By my estimations, the outcry from an acquittal will be roughly 10 times larger than what happened in June 2020. Doing some napkin math here, 10 times of 10% is 100%!!! Meaning if Chauvin is acquitted, CVS will be going all the way down to $0/share!!! The market is clearly not pricing this in, as CVS is currently trading at about $76/share, $76 more than it is actually worth.\n\nWith a verdict expected by the end of May, there is still time to get in on this once in a lifetime trade!!! I only wish I had enough capital to make (almost) unlimited gains on this play.\n\nEdit: Positions. Short $10k shares of $CVS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvg9qaagmdu61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97d7e65f294d5db2689e1d7ab56107b8bdebe2b9\n\nEdit 2: lol time to exit this tomorrow. I’m leaving it up for wsb.\n\nEdit 3: as of AH close I’m up $4.90. Hoping this holds til open tomorrow",
