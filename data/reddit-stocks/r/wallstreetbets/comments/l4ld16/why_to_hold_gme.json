In the VW squeeze in 2008, they abandoned the ship. This time, NOT! They INCREASED their short position, around 140% of the free float is now shorted. If we hold, there is not Moon, not Mars, but ALPHA centauri potential! 🚀🚀🚀 \n\n\n2) DELTA-HEDGING. Last week, the maximum call strike was 60$. All the calls, every fucking single one, expired ITM. Biggest bank for us! This week, they sold new ones, maximum strike 115$. For next Friday. I repeat. For NEXT FRIDAY. Its Monday and we are already at 106$ premarket. These call sellers have to hedge to not loose too much next Friday and even next week! They will buy more shares. Ends in less shares for shorts to hedge. \n\nThey outplay each other, and we sit in the middle like retarded autists holding our big dongus growing every day. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS HOLD, IF U WANT, BUT MORE! 🚀🚀🚀🙏🙏💎💎💎\n\n\nFuck the shorts, fuck fundamentals. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\nTo all the new retards, u don't need to understand what's going on here. Nobody does. I'm in since less than 150k gay autists, and all the big Tickers were right, every single time. Now more than ever. \n\nSpecial congrats to our God u/deepfuckingvalue, who will bust the 20,000,000.00$ today. 🚀🚀 \n\n\n\nAnd for the boomers and the S.E.C., this is not financial advise, do as ur little lovely autist heart tells you to do.\n\n\nEdit:\nPositions: 12 shares @ 34.50€. \n\nInteresting read about short squeeze effects: \"The effect of short interest on the subsequent stock \r\nperformance in NASDAQ-100 companies\" - by Schindler.\n\nTL;DR: GME is the new toilet paper.
