Stay humble and ask about what you don't know. After being insulted a few times, someone will help you out.\n\n---\n\n#What you can do to keep this place great\n\n* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.\n\n* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.\n\n* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!\n\n* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.\n\n* Don't ask \"what the next move is\" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't \"pump and dump\" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.\n\n---\n\n#What we're doing to keep this place great\n\n* The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.\n\n* In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.\n\n* We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.\n\n* We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.\n\n---\n\n#Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!\n\nOver the past week, there were multiple *really good* DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.\n\nBut you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. \n\nDon't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.\n\n---\n\n#A note on the moderation team:\n\nThe team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.\n\nThis mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.\n\nMaking everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.\n\nP.S. Dear SEC Intern: We don't endorse any tickers or movements.
