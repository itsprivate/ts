We‚Äôre talking about the next ones.\n* I‚Äôve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool‚Äôs insights.\n\n**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here‚Äôs how to interpret the stock picks.**\n\n* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an ‚Äúemerging stock‚Äù based on my model).\n* The ‚ÄúReasoning‚Äù I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program‚Äôs picks in order to understand why they‚Äôre generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.\n\n**Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.\n\n**Enough said, here‚Äôs the (small) list!**\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**\n\nMarket Cap: $6.5bn\n\nSarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.\n\nReasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.\n\n**Magna International (MGA) +436%**\n\nMarket Cap: $22.7bn\n\nMagna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.\n\nReasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple‚Äôs new car.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.\n\nIf y'all find these insights useful, please let me know and I‚Äôll keep sharing them here on a weekly basis :)",
