This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.*\n\nNow you may be thinking, **are we the greater fools?** I bought at 250 like a good little ape, and my answer is *no*.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that GME is not worth $200, or $300, or $420.69, or $8008.101 . We aren't betting on the actual value, we're betting on the greater fools. We're betting on the short squeeze, and *its day will come*.\n\nThe shorts will have to buy, no matter the price, so in this scenario *they are the greatest fools of all*.\n\nMelvin, Shitron, and other HF's will devolve below the monke and turn into single celled organisms only capable of breeding and shitting.\n\nHow can I confirm this? Lets do some retard math.\n\nThe average IQ defined in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale is 90-109, and since we're smooth brained, and in the \"Extremely low\" category, we're defined as 69 and below. So let's say we're all 69(nice). There are 9,665,680 r/WSB members at the time of writing. Multiply total users by 69 and we get **666,931,920**. With our combined monke IQ's we have decided we like the stock. Melvin has 33 employees, who we'll say are in the \"Superior\" IQ classification of 130 and above. Using maths, we can conclude their combined IQ is 4,290. So who is the greater fool, Melvin, who doesn't like the stock with an IQ of 4,290, or r/WSB, with a combined retard strength of 666,931,920 who like stonk.\n\nSo get your chickens ready, the deep fryer is heating up and tendies will be ready soon.\n\nThis is not financial advice.",
