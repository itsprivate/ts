I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, \"I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...\"\n\n2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.\n\n3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously. And yes, I'm sure some of his recommendations also pan out well but I wish he would man up and admit when he makes bad calls.",
