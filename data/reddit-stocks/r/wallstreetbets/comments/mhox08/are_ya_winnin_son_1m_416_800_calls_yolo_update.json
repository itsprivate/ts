The shorts have 45 days and counting before all hell breaks loose.**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause 'the shorts have closed.' So they say. However, as of 12/31/2020 (per Fintel), Insiders + 13F filers owned 97M of the 70M shares that exist in the world. So statically we can prove a minimum of 27M shares were shorted as of 12/31 without any concern for Finra disclosure 'mistakes'. At that time, it was widely accepted that there were about 100M shares shorted -- 140% of all the shares that exist (nevermind the float!).  So FINRA showed 4x the number of shorted shares than we can deduce from the 13F filings (as of 12/31)\n\nFor 3/31, if the 13F filers show that collectively still own about the same number of shares -- 97M or so o the the 70M shares that actually exist -- **shorts r fuk**.  Because it means they didn't cover a damn thing.\n\nIf anything, retail owns FAR more shares now (3/31) than they did 12/31 -- 3 weeks before GME caught main stream, world wide attention. We've seen HODLers from Europe, NZ, all over. The January RobinHood freeze was the rallying cry for the world.  **9% of US adults bought at least 1 share of GME during January.** They all bought. Many held. They didn't sell at $40, why would they have sold now at $190?\n\nI'm putting **(my own personal)** clock on this. 45 days and counting. I like being right. Getting paid is just gravy.",
