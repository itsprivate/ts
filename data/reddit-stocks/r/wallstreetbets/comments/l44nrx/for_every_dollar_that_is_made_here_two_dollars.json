Seeing someone, such as DFV, make $11m off $50k is the greatest advertisement ever. Many will see it and ask, how did he do it? They will “learn,” aka have no fucking idea, what an option is and proceed to lose thousands with the hope of making millions and quitting their job all while simultaneously getting revenge on their wife’s boyfriend. \n\nAgain, there is great advice here and truly smart people. There are also addicts who will say anything about a stock because they own $100 in an option. I’ve messaged with people who didn’t know the difference between a put and a call while holding 5+ figures of contracts and making less than $20 an hour. \n\nMy message? Please throw amounts of money at ideas that you’re willing to walk away from. Do not jeopardize your retirement, wife’s boyfriend’s new boat, or your children’s education on a DD from some 16 year old who has $50 in Victoria secret because boobs are getting bigger. On the other side of these trades there are likely people with drones monitoring Victoria secret factories and how many kids walk in and out of the manufacturing plant a day.",
