This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.\n\nI know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with \"to the moon 🚀\"\nBut please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks.

I honestly thought it would be downvoted to oblivion. But thanks folks. And I am not paper handed, still holding to the 1 stock I bought.
