This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.\n\nI know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with \"to the moon 🚀\"\nBut please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.\n\n___\n\nEdit 1 : I dint expect this post to blow up. I honestly thought it would be downvoted to oblivion. But thanks folks. And I am not paper handed, still holding to the 1 stock I bought.
