Hey Citadel/Melvin how you like these fucking Apples.\n\nGameStop.com\n4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. \n\nThat’s before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there’s no such thing as BAD press. \n(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) \n\nI ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you’re sooooooooo fucked!!!!!\n\nIf you use normal website sale conversations it’s usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you’re looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven’t figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let’s say that visitor rate increases 3x that’s 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can’t you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN’T even started yet and you’re shorting has given it a share price of $200. As investors we thank you so much for believing in our fledging company and what it has to offer the gaming community. Hahahaha man would I love to be on the GameStop board even just apart of the marketing team. You’re so fucked it’s not even funny. This is a marketing/comms team slam fucking dunk and it’s not even started. The shorters better get their shit together because imma go so fucking long on this investment I ain’t never letting go. I don’t even really want a squeeze I just want a $1,000 share price just by fundamentals so we can all shove it down your fucking boomer throats. God damn I can’t wait to watch Cramer suck RC’s dick live on air. That will taste so good. Imma lick the tears off Melvin’s and Citadel’s cheeks.",
