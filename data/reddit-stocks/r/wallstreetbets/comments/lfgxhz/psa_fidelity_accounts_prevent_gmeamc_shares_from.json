Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**.\n\nHowever, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.\n\nRetirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.\n\nNon-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be \"un-shortable.\" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.\n\nI hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.\n\nNot financial advice / I like the stock / GME & AMC to the 🌖🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548. Don't tell them I sent you ;)\n\nEdit 2: tighten the fucking noose on the shorts. If you're on other brokerages - call them and post the how-to for others. Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy's supply lines. You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.\n\nEdit 3: I'll hold your hand all the way.... click the tab Accounts & Trade > Account Features > Brokerage & Trading > Options. That will show you your options levels. Tighten the grip! 🐍\n\nEdit 4: hard to quantify, but if **ALL OF YOU** call your brokerage and cut off the lending of shares it will have a major positive affect on the GME share price.... let's call it a \"synthetic\" buy order to take shares out of circulation and tighten the squeeze. Hedge funds know the rules, it's time we stop being dumb retail traders and learn how our \"CoMmIsSiOn FrEe BrOkErAgE\" makes money off of us",
