Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.\n\nFinally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that \"Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.\"  \n\n\nI am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW.
