This was money that was supposed to be saved for buying a new house and was mainly accrued from dumping pay checks into SPY over the years. \n\nOn the 27th of February , I got tipped off from a buddy that works in the bunny breeding industry. He said that due to the pandemic, Europeans were buying pets like crazy, and one animal in particular... bunny rabbits. \n\nNow this made me look into Egyptian bunny futures as they produce the most bunnies in the world. The premiums were amazing, this was like buying fucking apple at IPO. On top of all of this, Easter was just a couple months around the corner and a massive shipment of bunnies was meant to leave Egypt and make its way to a port in France. I’m talking a fucking boat load of carrot munching, sex hungry, “what’s up doc” mother fuckers, not just a container. \n\nSo I placed my bet, expiring the week of Easter, for when the shipment would come. Since there were barely any bunnies in France/ all of Europe, there was no supply to meet demand. However, I had it on good authority that prices would barely drop since so many Europeans wanted the little fluffy fucks. \n\nAll was going well, my money was going up and it was the most euphoric feeling ever...\n\nUntil on Wednesday at 10am, I wake up to check how many unrealized tendies I have. To my horror I was down 48%. I frantically called my aforementioned buddy in the industry and he tells me to look up the Suez canal. \n\nIt turns out the shipment was delayed by a day out of Egypt and right after they left port, some big fucking ship decided to block the whole canal. Since Egypt shipped out essentially every last bunny in the damn country, they didn’t need any more bunny food. So every single one of them is going to run out of food over the next week and die on that ship (no point in bringing them back to port cause there’s no food to feed them). Once they arrive in France they will dump the dead bunnies, pick up the next shipment and move on. \n\nIdk how I’m going to tell my wife this, probably gonna need some protection from her boyfriend for a while too. \n\nWish me luck",
