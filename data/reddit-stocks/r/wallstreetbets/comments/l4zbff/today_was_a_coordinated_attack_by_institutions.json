The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday's close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish.

Don't let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.\n\n**TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped. Despite that, we defended Friday's close quite well so DON'T FUCKING SELL.**",
