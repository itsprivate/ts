CLNE is a fart mine of untapped potential with mega partnerships, positive rumors, and fundamentals.\n\nHello again fellow cow fart enthusiasts,\n\nWake the fuck up - it's show time.\n\nCLNE continues to be a major player here on reddit and across the media landscape. The news is talking about it, we're talking about it, everyone is talking about it. The company is positively positioned to take over a major market in renewable fuels for heavy transportation as per the many dozens of posts that have been produced. The long play has never changed, this is a growth stock that will grow - and we've been giving it a shot of life helping accelerate those plans. \n\n**Let's take a look at where we stand for the 6/18 call walls:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twcac5brbu571.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3bd9b60b4e9c5472643d14a23e7858367c47f5f\n\n**Not even considering the retards at $16 strikes and beyond....**\n\n**- 1.2 million shares of open interest at $10**\n\n**- 1.3 million shares of open interest at $11**\n\n**- 2.2 million shares of open interest at $12**\n\n**- 4 million shares of open interest at $13**\n\n# Likewise, the assault on cow farts has continued daily:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpy8oe79cu571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0e21b7e73a9ac5a49472d7164a4651ef4c24c6\n\n# Recent rumors, unconfirmed:\n\n* Per a power user on here, a deal with UPS in the works/nearing completion\n* CEO to appear on Mad Money\n* Upcoming presser\n\nThese are the things that have come up in the last day or two. The company is aware and actively working to improve their image in the face of new interest. They rebranded this week and updated their entire customer/public-facing image. The CEO tweeted what basically amounts to a meme, featuring Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon.\" I'm loving the engagement.\n\n**One thing I can say is that an absolute whale of a Chad has been buying shares today and unusual options activity alerts have been pinging this morning.**\n\n# I'm not going to beat a dead horse/cow here...\n\n...you all know the drill. This is a great stock and, as I originally said 2 weeks ago, the benefits of owning it go well beyond this expiration date. I'm still long on this one and will continue to be until the thesis changes. I'm still loving the short play. This is not financial advice, do you own DD.\n\n  \nSee you on the moon.\n\nCheers",
