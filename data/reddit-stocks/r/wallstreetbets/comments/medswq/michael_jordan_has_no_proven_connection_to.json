Michael Jordan is a celebrity, like Kim Kardashian. That's enough. Even heard about Beyonce's divorce?\n\nLet's review the facts. Quote from one of the articles:\n\n*\"Michael Jordan sold a stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2019 to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim\".* \n\nThat's it for the facts. Plotkin name. Plotkin gave Jordan some money in exchange for a stake in a sports team TWO YEARS AGO. Jordan probably doesn't even remember his face by now. Oh, and Jordan lost some money, no one knows the details because why would they know?\n\nIs it enough to spin a story around it? No. But we'll do it anyway by implying it indirectly and by making speculative bullshit connections and by misleading headlines, like we've done every day with Beyonce's divorce for over a decade now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>HEADLINE: *Michael Jordan Is Directly Connected to the GameStop Trading War and Has Been Bleeding Money for the Last Year* \n\nText of the article two scrolls lower: *While Michael Jordan himself didn’t lose any money during the GameStop trade war (that we know of anyway).* \n\nSo you don't know anything.
