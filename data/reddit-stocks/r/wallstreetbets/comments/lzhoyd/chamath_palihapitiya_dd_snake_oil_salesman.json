You can decide for yourself if you like this guy or not.\n\n1. **Ρ** ump and dumped GME. He sent out a tweet buying gme, and then sold it later the same day without sending out a sale tweet. He realized people had an issue with this then decided to donate the profits to charity. The problem with this is not only did he make his followers bag hold, but he also gets a free tax write off from them.

Don't buy into the \"good guy\" bull shit. He just wants to enrich himself off of you. I like some of his stocks, but I won't be touching them after looking into him.",
