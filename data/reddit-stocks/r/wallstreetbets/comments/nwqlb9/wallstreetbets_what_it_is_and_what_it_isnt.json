Not WallStreet-Down-with-Hedge-Funds.\n\nIt is WallStreet**BETS**. This sub was started to discuss and trade FD’s. If you don’t know what that means, then you probably don’t belong here. This sub was dedicated to 0dte puts & calls. Again, if that term is unfamiliar to you, then you probably shouldn't be here. This sub discusses strategies and plays on high-risk, short-duration, option contracts on stocks, stock indexes, ETF’s, and related securities, namely **dailies**. This sub’s idea of a long-term investment strategy is buying weeklies. This sub is most likely made up of people with ADHD, who can’t see past tomorrow, and have already forgotten what they had for breakfast.\n\nOccasionally, the play may be to buy and hold a stock for a short duration, but that is an exception, not the rule.\n\nIf you want to buy and hold a security to effect change, or to stick it to the hedge funds, or to shake your fist at the Wall Street elite, then there are other subreddits for that. That is not **THIS** subreddit’s mantra.\n\nThis sub has only one mantra: that is to make money daily. Period. We measure wins & losses in 24-hr increments. And the only thing that counts is the amount in your account at the end of the day.\n\nThis sub is not a “get-rich-quick” scheme. That kind of thinking leads to “get-poor-quick” results.\n\nThis sub views the stock market as a casino. Like any casino, there are strategies you can employ to improve your odds. And that is what is (or should be) discussed here.\n\nAnd like a casino, there is a high degree of risk; including risk of total loss. Do not be fooled, you should expect losses. The stock market is a “zero-sum-game”. For every winner, there must be a loser. It takes two (2) people to effect a trade. For every buyer, there is a seller. For every “+”, there is a “-“.\n\nThis sub is **NOT** a collective. Collective action is tantamount to collusion, which can lead to market manipulation, and that is **NOT** what this sub is about. That shit will get you 10 years in ClubFed.\n\nAnd lastly, for God’s sake, we are **NOT** apes. If anything, we are **nerds**. Math nerds. Numbers nerds. And damn proud of it. We discuss the Greek’s. And if you don’t know what that means, then really, **REALLY**, you don’t belong here.\n\nIf you want to lurk here and learn, then by all means, please do. Ask questions. We will most likely make fun of you, but ask. Someone nice will answer your question.\n\n**EDITORS NOTE**: Please excuse my very short account life. I am not an OG WSB, but I do get what the intention of this sub was, and I’m getting tired of reading off-topic posts and comments. I came here to make money, not to rise up against the establishment.\n\n**TL;DR** : This is **NOT** a collective, this is a **CASINO**.\n\n**EDIT #1**: I stand corrected on one critical point. An OG WSB graciously pointed out that daily's, weekly's, monthly's, LEAPS, and swing trades on stocks have always been welcomed here. But the point being, these are bets, not investments.",
