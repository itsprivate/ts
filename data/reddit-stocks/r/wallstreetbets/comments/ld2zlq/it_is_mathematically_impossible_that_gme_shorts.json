If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen? \n\nIt’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here. \n\nJan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short. \n\nNow people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover. \n\nHold your fucking shares.\n\nEdit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.\n\nEdit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking **ZERO**. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= *-$45* Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money. \n\nPlease get your head out of your ass. **if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.**",
