If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nEarning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing\n\nP/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)\n\n**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**\n\nRevenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \\~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.\n\nOne of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.\n\n**Balance book:**\n\nWISH has $1.6B cash. \\~$2B total assets, \\~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. \n\n**Insider selling:**\n\nAnother concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.\n\n**Technicals:**\n\nAgain, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nFrom a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \\~1, and that would be absurd.",
