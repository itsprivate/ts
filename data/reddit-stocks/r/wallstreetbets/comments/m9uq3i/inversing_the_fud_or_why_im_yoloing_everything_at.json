Amplifying naturally negative sentiment, misleading DD/posts and divisive comments are a hidden knife in the dark trying to chip at diamond hands.**\n\nFirst time posting here but I just wanted to go through my basic reasoning on why I'm still in this and still holding 69 @ 420 (to fuck with datamining) despite doubts here and there.\n\nAs a quick summary, I heard of WSB from my brother and from some occasional /r/all posts about the shenanigans before GME happened and generally dismissed it as people yeet'ing their life savings away and either winning big or going broke.  I was not aware at the time that there were potentially wrinkled brain people putting solid DD or smooth-brained people putting shitty DD and getting called out by the more wrinkly ones.\n\nGME popped off and I saw it in /r/all and decided to try to catch the train after it already left with RH pulling its shit and bought in $1000 at $135 on the way down.  It was a calculated gamble of what I could afford to lose and seeing hundreds evaporate made me go \"okay, that was stupid, lesson learned, let's look at index funds for my other $1000\"\n\nGME popped back up to $185 and I saw my portfolio go green with several hundreds of potential profit and for the first time when it went back down I really had wanted to paper hand and not lose what I thought was a dying last breath of GME.  I figured $1000 still lost, nothing changed\n\nWhen it started rising for the THIRD time I got serious about doing my DD, reading every single scrap I could find, analyzing the FUD and following DFV's and Cohen's movements and potential sentiments about the stock.\n\n**Here's my personal reasoning for HODL'ing**\n\n1. DFV, the man who took us all here in the first place, is still holding.  That man has done more research than any of us with over a year's worth.  That alone is telling.\n2. Business transformation DD, all the signs seem positive that Gamestop is going to turn into something that's worth at least $200 if not more in the future.  It's a safe long-term hold post-squeeze given I bought in early enough.\n3. Media FUD on such huge levels that would make you sound like a conspiracy theorist pointing it out.  The silence on up-swings and clamor at down-swings is one of the biggest reasons I'm HODL'ing.  There is no reason to spend millions on something that you aren't worried about.  Obviously someone's sweating.\n4. Actual data and analysis (not the Big Dipper Astrology TA I see flying around) with bullish indicators including price manipulation showing that there is institutional interest long-side.\n\n**The reason I felt like writing this up was because I've seen subtler manipulation potentially going on in WSB and I'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy seeing things that aren't there.**\n\n1. WSB vs RKT/UWMC/etc. manipulation.  Early on when RKT was popping off there was a rise in antagonistic sentiments between holders of both stocks.  I'm not 100% sure but I believe this was proven to be manipulation to cause discord and dissent.  Ape no fight ape and all that.\n2. That one shill who would post positive things to get upvotes (Rocket emojis) and then edit them in post to seem like people were up-voting anti-GME sentiment.  I don't have the user to link at this time but it's clever and I won't doubt that there might be similar users out there using like tricks.\n3. Options 101 for apes to send money to Citadel.  One user noted that a lot of tutorials on how to use calls, puts, etc. came out of nowhere around the same time.  This was potentially manipulation to get new-found suckling apes to send money to MM's in poorly informed and dumb option plays (800c's anybody?) to send premium right to the other side.\n4. Anti-GME sentiment amplification in WSB.  I'm not saying that there isn't actual complaints about the influx of users or the cult-like mentality of many holding GME.  But I believe that the people behind Melvin and Citadel aren't actually retarded.  They will have people trawling this subreddit looking for any kind of sentiment that can be inflamed or used, or have algorithims doing the same.  I've seen comments trailing off of \"DAE tired of apes ruining the good ol' WSB\" saying \"I'm selling my $1600 GME because fuck those damn apes ruining OUR WSB\"\n\nAll in all Reddit is not immune to influence both belligerent and subtle; there are foreign powers that spend millions to influence users outside of WSB in the greater site as a whole.  I believe that if mainstream media, downvote bots and basic shills are the sledgehammer against paper-hands, that subtler influence, negative sentiment amplification, and other less-noisy tools are the knife in the dark trying to pry off hesitant or on-the-fence hands.\n\nI may be going crazy connecting un-related dots, but if there's one thing you should never do it's never underestimate the enemy and beware of an animal cornered.  **As stupid of a large strategic decision it was to over-short Gamestop, there are still dangerous and brilliant minds working under the umbrella of short-side hedgefunds and market makers.**  Be careful out there, everyone.
