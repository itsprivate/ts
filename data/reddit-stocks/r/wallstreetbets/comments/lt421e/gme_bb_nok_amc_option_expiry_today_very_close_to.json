They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired.

So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.\n\nBB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.\n\nNOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.\n\nCatalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).\n\nEveryone have a great weekend.\n\nDisclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only.
