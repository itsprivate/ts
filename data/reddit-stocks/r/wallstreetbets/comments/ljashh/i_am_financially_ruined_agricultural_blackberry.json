After watching a video about David H. Murdock, CEO of Dole, and his pseudo-monopoly over bananas, I decided to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's blackberry yield would be smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in Central Mexico and a colder-than-average spring.

Unfortunately, the recent concerns over high-flying stocks driven up by large short covering caused a massive drop-off in demand due to the futures being associated with a Canadian technology company of the same name, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of February 8th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive blackberry shipment from the Mexican state of Jalisco, scheduled for early May, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in March, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the blackberries in this shipment were absolutely gargantian, some topping 20 grams each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per kilo.
