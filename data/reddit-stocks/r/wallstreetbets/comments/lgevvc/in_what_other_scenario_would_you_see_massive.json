Google trends for \"how to buy a Reddit account\" skyrocketed on those critical days when RH was fucking all of us without lube.\n\nHow hard do you think it would be for a hedge fund worth billions to put about 100 interns on \"buy accounts and bots duty\"? Not  very fucking hard. How many people would be willing to sell their account for $1,000 (or $100, whatever, I don't know) if contacted? Probably a lot. It's not hard to make a new reddit account.

I just think there's some weird shit going on socially here on this subreddit and it really seems like there's a clear anti-GME agenda being pushed by a demographic OTHER than the one you would expect (old gay bears).** You need to make up your own mind about this. I'm just saying-- if GME were really over a whole ass week ago, WHY sit around here and make post after post about how people should sell and are so stupid for holding? What's the point? You're going to tell me all of those new accounts are just bored people coming here specifically to preach an anti-GME message? Seems very fishy.",
