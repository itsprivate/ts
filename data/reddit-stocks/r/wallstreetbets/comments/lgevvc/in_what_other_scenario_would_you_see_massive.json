Google trends for \"how to buy a Reddit account\" skyrocketed on those critical days when RH was fucking all of us without lube.\n\nHow hard do you think it would be for a hedge fund worth billions to put about 100 interns on \"buy accounts and bots duty\"? Not  very fucking hard. How many people would be willing to sell their account for $1,000 (or $100, whatever, I don't know) if contacted? Probably a lot. It's not hard to make a new reddit account.
