I’ve learned a very hard lesson and will never buy calls again, and will probably leave the market alone for quite a while completely while I try to get back on my feet.

I know I made a mistake so please save the harsh words.  I feel terrible enough already.\n\nEdit: yes I recommended others buy shares and not calls.
