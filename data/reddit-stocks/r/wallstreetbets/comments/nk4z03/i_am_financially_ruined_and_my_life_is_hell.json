They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.\n\nSo I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  \n\nAnd then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  \n\nYou know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  \n\nThen my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  \n\ntl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures.",
