I’m hoping to be able to retire someday.\n\nI recently found WSB and I’ve made some savvy moves. I’ve also made some dumb moves. I’m down $62,000 this year (almost double my salary 🤦‍♂️) If SQ hits 300 this month, I will be back to even, however. \n\nAnyway, my 12-year-old son just started a stock market class in school. They have been trading for the past two months starting with $10,000 imaginary dollars. He was telling me about it and I was like “sure sure” just nodding along until he tells me he is up to $1.5 million! I didn’t believe it until he showed me! The kid has a gift. 😃 I talked to his teacher and she was so impressed. She made an off-hand comment about how lucky I am to have someone so good with stocks in my family. \n\nAnd that’s when it hit me. My son should run my portfolio! \n\nBUT I don’t want to put too much pressure on him if anything goes wrong. So I don’t want him to even know it’s real money. \n\nMy plan is to “Enders Game” him. I’m going to tell him that I found an international scholarship program and the first person to turn $250,000 into $10 million wins a free scholarship to college. (Which I will of course be able to pay for out of the winnings.)\n\nI feel really good about this plan and I’m planning on handing my passwords over to him on Monday. Just wondering if anyone has ever done anything like this and if so do they have any tricks or tips? My main concern is he realizes he’s actually trading real money. I want him to be ready to take the risks necessary to help daddy retire. \n\nThis is the biggest risk I’ve ever taken but I feel so fricken good about it. Thoughts and prayers are appreciated.
