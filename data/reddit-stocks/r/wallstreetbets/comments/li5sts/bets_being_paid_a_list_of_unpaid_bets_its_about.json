Ban unless he produces proof of a tattoo booking, it's been long enough.\n\nu/HollaHollaBillsYall said they'd get the WSB logo \"tattooed on my ass while smoking a joint with the tattoo artist\" if it hit $420.69. \n\nu/Hidhtr said they'd get the WSB logo \" 'if' \"it\" crosses 420$\" - if? LOL\n\nu/sc00ba_steve owes a rocket emoji tattoo, another \"$420.69\"-er.\n\nu/EzClapsFN said $100 and owes a GeeEmEe tattoo.\n\nCongrats to u/raymofwuk on his geeEmEe/WSB ass tattoo, he said he'd get it if Gee eM Eee hit $200 a share- he literally bet his ass! Way to go!\n\nThis is a casino, and bets need to be paid. These assholes pretend-betting are ruining the essence of WSBets.",
