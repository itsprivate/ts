They stopped at the biggest port in Africa which was in South Africa. Many companies also offloaded goods at a discount in South Africa.\n\n This sent the entire economy of South Africa into hyperdrive. Look at a GDP chart for south africa and you'll see the huge jump in 1967. Their stock market rallied because of it too.\n\nThe same dynamic is playing out today.

That ship has been there for 4 days and there is no sign that it will be out soon. Most likely it will be MONTHS of losses for him.\n\nOh yeah, and if I'm wrong? Their stock market is one of the cheapest in the world from a value perspective. AN etf that tracks their stocks Is trading at less than 4x earnings.
