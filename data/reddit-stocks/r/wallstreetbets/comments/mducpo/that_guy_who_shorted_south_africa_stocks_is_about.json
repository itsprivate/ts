Ships heading to Europe from Asia had to go around the horn of Africa, adding up to 12,000 miles to their journey. \n\nThis meant that the crews had to stop along the way for fuel and provisions. They stopped at the biggest port in Africa which was in South Africa. Many companies also offloaded goods at a discount in South Africa.\n\n This sent the entire economy of South Africa into hyperdrive. Look at a GDP chart for south africa and you'll see the huge jump in 1967. Their stock market rallied because of it too.\n\nThe same dynamic is playing out today. Suez canal has been blocked for 4 days. It is likely to be blocked for MONTHS. That means a lot of ships will be stopping in South Africa,  sending their economy to the moon for thhe first time since the 1960s.\n\nThe guy who was trying to short south Africa ETFs a while back had some solid DD, but the suez canal blockage is about to suck all the money out of his brokerage account. That ship has been there for 4 days and there is no sign that it will be out soon. Most likely it will be MONTHS of losses for him.\n\nOh yeah, and if I'm wrong? Their stock market is one of the cheapest in the world from a value perspective. AN etf that tracks their stocks Is trading at less than 4x earnings. If youre a boomer, youll love the 5% dividends too.\n\nTL;DR get your south african tendies while they're hot. I just put in 10k.",
