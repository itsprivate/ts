Don’t want this to be a propaganda piece just sharing my experience.  \n\nSo, I woke up this morning to my wife standing over me holding my phone.  She doesn’t even give me time to  open my eyes and she says “who the hell is Robin!”  I’m tired, haven’t had my morning poo or my Honey Nut Cheerios so of course I’m in no state of mind to understand what she means.  I replied, “I don’t know any Robins”.  She continues yelling at me telling me that I think she’s an idiot, that I’m talking to all of my friends about her and she knew that they were looking at her funny last time we hung out.  So finally she throws the phone at me and says if you don’t want to be honest fine, I’ll just leave.  So I’m up enough to read at this point, and when I look at my phone I had texted my buddy Ray, “I’m gonna get all up in Robin Hood Monday morning, I’m a horny bull for some XX and don’t worry I’m gonna XXXX off before I get home to my wife.”  That was one of my more PG texts - as I’m sure my fellow apes can understand that I go hard on something when I believe it can make me that money (XX) - and when I believe in the company (XXXX).  Anyways, 2 hours of convincing later I’m still married.  However she now knows where all of our money is going - down the big fat drain.  Not sure if I’ll get upvotes or down votes for that last part.  Happy weekend retards, if anyone has some good loss porn please post it, I think I’ll be on the couch for a few days.",
