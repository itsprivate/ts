But I was pretty much depressed. \n\nNow I consider myself a well informed retarded gambler. The stock market has literally changed my life for the better, and has completely changed my outlook on money and how the system is there to teach people to work, not to be wealthy. \n\nMy fellow autist, you a smarter then most people who don't know jackshit about how much money you can make on the markets. Most people just give there money to the banks or just do passive investing(I have no issues with this, but missing out on great opportunities is super retarded). \n\nTo everyone who wrote dds and gave advice, thank you. I don't care if it was bad, because I learned a fuck ton because you autist think differently. I am ready to share as much helpful info back!\n\nTLDR:\n\n\nLove you guys full homo and STONKS and options = ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€",
