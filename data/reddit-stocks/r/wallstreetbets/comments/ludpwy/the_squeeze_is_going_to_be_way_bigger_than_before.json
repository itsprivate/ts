Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that’s 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)\n3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to <100\nTLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain’t finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. \nIn conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn’t have gotten buttfucked to begin with.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to add 20@ 85.
