  "selftext": "With the upcoming [Nasdaq listing](https://mindmed.co/news/press-release/mindmed-to-commence-trading-on-nasdaq/) of Mindmed(MNMD), I'm sure a lot of you are ready for the first ever \"shroom boom\" on the North american stock exchange. While tendies are definitely an outcome of this, there's more to it than that. I discovered Mindmed after seeing my dad live with PTSD/depression his whole life as well as having a good friend pass away because of an overdose, and have been behind their mission of combating mental health issues and ending the opioid addiction problem ever since.\n\nA few statistics:\n\n\\-**92 Million people use opioids globally**\n\n\\-**$500 Billion spent on opioids in the US alone**\n\n\\-[There has been an 844% in benzodiazepine overdose deaths since 1999](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates)\n\n\\-**284 Million globally suffer from anxiety**\n\n**-$4.7 Billion is spent on anxiety medication annually**\n\nAnxiety is growing as social media usage skyrockets. **Since widespread social media adoption in 2009, there has been a 189%  increase in self-harm**. And now COVID-19 is causing job loss, isolation, and overall fear. **Anxiety medications have increased 34.1% month-over-month in the first few months of COVID-19.**\n\n**21 million Americans have at least one addiction**, yet despite focused efforts in the space, which are saving lives on a daily basis, only 10% of those individuals receive treatment.  Addiction is a brain disease, driven by a set of disease processes including the dysregulation of dopamine, a potent neurotransmitter, in the brain’s reward/pleasure center located in the midbrain.\n\nMindmed has plenty of catalysts down the pipeline that will bring tendies, but more importantly, it'll bring peace of mind to both those suffering from mental health disorders and those who have to sit on the sideline and watch their loved one go through it\n\n**A few projects currently on their timeline:**\n\n[\\- Project Lucy](https://mindmed.co/experiential-therapies/#anxiety)**:**  Project Lucy involves a hallucinogenic dosing of LSD to treat anxiety, administered by a therapist. LSD increases brain communication and supports talk therapy by expanding the mind and minimizing inhibitions. **MindMed is currently preparing to initiate our Phase 2b human efficacy trial for experiential doses of LSD.**\n\n[\\-18-MC](https://mindmed.co/psychedelic-inspired/#scroll_section-1)**:**  \"We are developing 18-MC to treat the cause of the brain disease that is addiction, rather than solely the symptoms. Sustained mental healing requires addressing a root cause and a comprehensive approach for the entire patient journey. Cue-induced reinstatement, or relapse,  is when an individual with a substance use disorder is prompted by their surroundings to consume a harmful substance (example: The clink of a wine glass at a dinner party for a person with an alcohol use disorder).\" **Currently in phase 1B FDA trials.**\n\nWhile this is still a very new form of pharma, this has potential to be the new wave of mental health treatment. With [Biden pushing heavy for the end of opioid addiction](https://www.psychcongress.com/article/biden-pledges-assertive-action-address-opioid-crisis-0), Mindmed is armed and ready to take on that task.\n\nBuying and holding this will put MindMed on the map for more people who are unfamiliar with this revolutionary treatment.
