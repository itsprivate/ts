  "selftext": "Himax Technologies, Inc. is a leading supplier and fabless semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Tainan City, Taiwan founded on 12 June 2001.\n\nThe company IMHO is so undervalued at this price and has much room to go up, HIMX had strong revenue and earnings growth in the last 4 quarters, but the stock price did not act accordingly, and I believe this growth will continue due to chip shortage, and the transformation in the global economy to electric cars, in 2030 most of the big cars brands are expected to stop producing diesel cars and produce only electric cars, this is regardless the already existed electric cars brands like Xpeng, Nio, Tesla etc. this will cause constant demand on chips and more production and revenue for HIMX and other semiconductor stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[HIMX Revenue and Earnings over the last 4 quarters](https://preview.redd.it/u5g0jy7vvk281.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=12c95a4227644109ca4be596b4ce38d3a91b3ff1)\n\nBelow a comparison between AMD and HIMX performance for the last 4 quarters:\n\n.HIMX Revenue growth ................  AMD Revenue growth\n\nQ4 2020 $276M **QoQ +15%** \\----- Q4 2020 $3.24B **QoQ +15%**\n\nQ1 2021 $309M **QoQ +12%** \\------ Q1 2021 $3.45B **QoQ +7%**\n\nQ2 2021 $365M **QoQ +18%** \\------- Q2 2021 $3.85B **QoQ +12%**\n\nQ3 2021 $421M **QoQ +15% -------** Q3 2021 $4.31B **QoQ +12%**\n\n    ....................HIMX...........AMD\n\nPrice to Earnings ............ 5.35 .................... 49.23\n\nPrice to Sales  ..................1.29  ....................12.76\n\nBook value per share .....$4.17!! 🤯  ...........$5.89!! 🤯\n\nCurrent ratio  ...................2.01 ...................... 2.24\n\nAMD is definitely bigger name than HIMX but I used this comparison just to show how HIMX is growing on the same pace as AMD, how it has healthy statistics, and how cheap its valuation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIMO HIMX is a solid play and a bargain at this price, the only thing that is holding back the stock price is the possible conflict between China and Taiwan, but if that happens, all the market will tank.\n\nMy conservative prediction is that One year from now assuming normal market conditions HIMX price will be at least $20.\n\nAlso 15% short interest add some spice to the stock.\n\nAnd my last word is, see you on the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙\n\n*Disclaimer: this is not a financial advice, do your own DD before investing.*",
