Have a quiet cry and jerk when you do cash out (below -$1000 of course), or come up with some other tale about how you totally sold at a vastly more opportune time than you really did.\n\nGME the depths of your rock bottom ego 🍆🍆🍆  (BB 🚀🚀🚀 tho) Godspeed bois\n\nEdit: please also consider giving a portion of your remaining funds to a stripper to make your world better in many ways",
