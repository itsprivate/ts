It zigzags, selling off when stocks climb too high too fast — and when the market contains too much froth and speculation — which creates buying opportunities as prices fall. \n\nI know: Looking at your portfolio on red days is difficult. So don’t! Do not look at how much you’re down in one day, or in individual positions. That data will only deject you. Rather, scroll down to the stocks you want to buy. Skip the painful part and go directly to the deals.\n\nAnd remember: all signs point to this market recovering from here, and then reaching over 4000SPX in the relatively near future. Most end-of-year projections from Wall Street have the S&P finishing 2021 around 4300-4500. That’s quite the yearly gain! We want to be in this market long-term, as vaccines roll out and the economy recovers and booms.\n\nSo how to buy the dip?\n\nYou should have a list of stocks you’re watching. Either these are stocks you want to own, or current positions you want to increase. Determine what entry point you want to buy. And keep an eye on our market support levels, which are 3850SPX-3775. Purchase a little bit at your price — or at support — to make sure you at least start a position, in case this dip is on the shorter side. From there, buy in tranches on the way down. Never buy all at once. Buy a little bit during the morning, afternoon and before the closing bell, to make sure you get a range of prices, including whatever turns out to be the best.\n\nAnd always assume the dip might last another day or so. Save some money for future, deeper selloffs in the days ahead, as the market goes through the volatile motions of a healthy selloff. Just as the market never goes straight up, it also zigzags on the way down. Give yourself the opportunity to buy over the course of several days. \n\nBuy the dip, and then thank yourself in the weeks and months ahead as these positions push into the green. That’s what’s worked for me. Do the bulk of your buying when other people are selling. \n\n**Obviously: I am not a professional financial advisor and this is not professional financial advice.**",
