The equity dilution is only 7%.\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales \n* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. \n* Crypto revenue is not sustainable \n* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe ARM deal may not go through\n\nThe chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.\n\nWith these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.\n\nThere are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.\n\nThe second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.\n\n>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  \n>  \n>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”\n\n**Valuation**\n\nSure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower. \n\nSources: Wall Street Journal, Seeking Alpha, Forbes, Motley Fool.",
