Everyone seems to think that they are all gurus in trading, and they have the \"right\" answer. But, the reality is that there are over 1mil+ different ways to trade and be successful. It varies greatly depending on how \"active\" you are in your portfolio. Some people are in there 50 times per day, others maybe 1-2 times per month. What works for one person might not work for another, and so on.\n\nJust because someone has an annual target over 10% doesn't mean they're crazy. Maybe they are in the group that checks their portfolio 50 times per day, and they flip stocks rapidly in the short-term for compounded gains. You think Wall Street day-job traders would accept only a 10% gain per year? lol... Just because someone only invests in blue-chips and not micro-cap stocks \"going to the moon!\" doesn't mean they don't like money. Maybe they just prefer less risk.\n\nIn short, it's important to remember that people all are doing very different strategies. There is no single correct answer. Perhaps before assuming anything, people should ask/clarify their approaches first. I normally try to provide my specifics at least in the body of the original post, however I still find that many people skip that part, or just don't agree with it, and then proceed to name-calling, ridiculing, and everything besides actually offering clarity or advice.\n\nWe're a great community here, and I appreciate all of you! But please, whenever possible let's work to ask questions and ask for clarity instead of assuming things and being un-helpful.\n\nHappy trading!!!! (and plz stay positive because we all know the last 3 weeks haven't been fun, but they will turn around soon, haha!)",
