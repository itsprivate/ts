I have made this a neutral DD where you can draw your own conclusions based on the information provided. You'll see a list of bearish arguments and bullish arguments. In addition, I've benchmarked KGC against their largest gold mining competitor - Newmont Corporation (NEM). I hope you'll find this useful. So let's dive in...\n\n# Basics\n\n**Company:** Kinross Gold Corporation\n\n**HQ:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n**Industry:** Gold and silver mining\n\n**Exchange:** NYSE\n\n**Ticker:** KGC vs. NEM (Newmont Corporation)\n\n**Price:** $6.39 vs. $56.14 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Market Cap:** 7.95B vs. 44.29B \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Avg Trading Volume:** 19.5M vs. 6.24M \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Short % of Shares Outstanding:** 1.19% vs. 1.00% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**Institutional Shares:** 67.4% vs. 84.11% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**12 Month Price Change:** 56.6% vs. -5.8% \\[5\\]\\[6\\]\n\n**PE Ratio:** 5.99 vs. 15.76 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**P/B Ratio:** 1.22 vs. 1.96 \\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n**P/S Ratio:** 1.93 vs. 3.95 \\[9\\]\\[10\\]\n\n**3 Year Net Income Growth:** 5788.14% vs. 729.61% \\[11\\]\\[12\\]\n\n**Projected Revenue:** $4.6B vs. $13.5B \\[13\\]\\[14\\]\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.29 vs. 0.26 \\[15\\]\\[16\\]\n\n**Industry Average Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.01 \\[17\\]\n\n**ESG Risk Rating:** 30.5 vs. 25.5 \\[18\\]\\[19\\]\n\n## Bearish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.19% in short % of shares outstanding. \n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 16.71% in shares held by institutions.\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.03 in debt to equity ratio. \n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 5 in ESG risk rating\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's debt to equity ratio is significantly higher than the metal mining industry's average debt to equity ratio. This could be explained by the sharp increase in production (linked to gold prices appreciating) and choosing to take on debt to finance operations \\[15\\]\\[17\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has dropped 29.5% in the last 6 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs very poorly among its competitors for its carbon footprint \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs poorly among its competitors for its water conservation \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Share price is below 20 and 200 MA (bearish signal for some, bullish for others).\n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Gold price decreased by 10% in the past 6 months and 5% in the past 30 days \\[20\\].\n\n\\- In 2020, global gold production fell by 5.2%. In 2019, global gold production fell by 1% (first time since 2008) \\[24\\].\n\n\\- *\"Based on known reserves, estimates suggest that gold mining could reach the point of being economically unsustainable by 2050, though new vein discoveries will likely push that date back somewhat.\" \"...It is unlikely that large-scale gold mining will continue past 2075 without either huge mining technology advances or the discovery of currently unknown massive gold deposits\"* \\[22\\].\n\n\\- *\"Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. For example, gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.\"*  \\[23\\].\n\n## Bullish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 62.4% in 12 month price change.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 9.77 in PE ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 0.74 in P/B ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 2.02 in P/S ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 5,058.5% in 3 year net income growth.\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's projected revenue of $4.6B for 2021 is 2.4x higher than current total debt of $4.2B and has the potential to decrease the company's debt to equity ratio, moving it closer to the industry's average \\[13\\]\\[15\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has seen significant gains in net income in the past 3 years, growing by 5788.14% \\[11\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has grown 56.6% in the last 12 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's stock has a low short % of shares (1.19%) outstanding with a high % of shares held by institutional investors (67.4%) \\[3\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold announced in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated. Management has displayed confidence in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023 \\[25\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's updates on development projects, exploration and mineral reserves, and resources show successful signs of progress with no delays. The company reported extensions of mine life at several sites as well as an expansion of mineral reserves \\[27\\]. \n\n\\- Kinross Gold has an EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years \\[28\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is JP Morgan's ‘top pick in the gold sector,’ rated as Overweight (i.e., a Buy) \\[29\\]. \n\n\\- Kinross Gold has beaten analysts earning estimates the last 4 quarters \\[30\\].\n\n\\- Average analyst recommendation rating is a Buy with an average analyst price target at $12,08 \\[13\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is a top performer among its competitors for its pollution prevention, workplace health and safety, and diversity of corporate leadership \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs well among its competitors for its employee satisfaction and pay and corporate governance \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has shared new plans and renewed commitment to decrease carbon footprint and water conservation \\[31\\]\\[32\\] \n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Investing in a growing gold company can act as leverage to the price of gold. When gold appreciates, gold mining companies can increase their production and grow revenues. The price of gold has increased substantially by 561% over the past 20 years, 36% in the past 5 years, and 5.8% in the last 12 months. This has provided smaller mining companies like Kinross with the leverage they need to grow their sales \\[11\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- There's a general weak US dollar outlook, especially once COVID worries subside. Gold is a good hedge against inflation when the value of the dollar falls \\[33\\].\n\n\\- 7.5% of worldwide demand for gold comes from the consumer technology industry. As the industry grows, demand for gold will grow with it, driving up the price. Consumer technology is projected to generate $2.06 trillion in 2023, compared to $1.69 trillion in 2019 \\[34\\]\\[35\\].\n\n\\- Gold is widely regarded as a good hedge against economic turbulence and uncertainty, and is therefore considered a recession-proof investment.\n\n\\- Global gold production is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 \\[36\\].\n\n## Sources\n\n\\[1\\]
