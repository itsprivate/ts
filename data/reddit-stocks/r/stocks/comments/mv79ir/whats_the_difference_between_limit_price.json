As for selling, if the market price rises to ur limit price or above, it will help you to sell the stock? Assuming there is enough liquidity in the market.\n\nStop-Loss Price is to set a price whereby if the market price drops to that level, you will want to sell the stock no matter what. So let say I set it at $90, and the market price plummeted to $85, and there is only liquidity at $85 but no one wants to buy at $90, it will help me to sell at $85? Does this mean no matter how much the market plummet to, as long as the market price drops below $90, at a price with enough liquidity, it will help me sell? How does Stop-Loss Price apply when buying?\n\nStop-Limit Price is just Stop-Loss Price with a limit pricing? So if I set my Stop-Loss Price at $90, at any price below or at $90, it will trigger the Stop-Loss Price? But can I put my Limit Price both higher or lower than my Stop-Loss Price? So if I put my Limit Price at $92, once the market rises back to $92 or above from $90 and below when the Stop-Loss Price was triggered, it will help me sell my shares? What if the price never goes back up to $90 and above? Does my stock never get sold? So shouldnt I set my Limit Price at $88, whereby once the Stop-Loss Price is triggered at $90, it will help me sell my shares at $88 and above? Also, how does this apply to the context of buying?\n\nThank you!",
