Taiwan responded to Xi by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan's people could decide their future.

Peaceful \"reunification\" best meets the overall interests of the Taiwanese people, but China will protect its sovereignty and unity, he added. \"No one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Xi said. \"The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.\" He struck a slightly softer tone than in July, his last major speech mentioning Taiwan, in which he vowed to \"smash\" any attempts at formal independence. In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing's control.\n\n\nStill, the speech was poorly received in Taiwan. The presidential office said they were a sovereign independent country, not part of the People's Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China's offer of \"one country, two systems\" to rule the island. \"The nation's future rests in the hands of Taiwan's people,\" the office said.",
