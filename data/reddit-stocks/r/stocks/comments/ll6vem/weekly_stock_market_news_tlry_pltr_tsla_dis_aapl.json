Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it‚Äôs important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.\n\nWe also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I‚Äôm not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.\n\nIn terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.\n\nThis [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the ‚Äúchatter‚Äù on Reddit‚Äôs biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it‚Äôs still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.\n\nMeanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)\n\nWe also saw numbers from Tesla‚Äôs China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.\n\nRegarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one‚Äôs last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.\n\nApple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault‚Äôs 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It‚Äôs also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it‚Äôs still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it‚Äôs pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.\n\nAlso, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.\n\nWe also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn‚Äôt stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.\n\nMeanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn‚Äôt help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.\n\nOne last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world‚Äôs smartphones.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.\n\n**Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!
