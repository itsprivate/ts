  "selftext": "**$TAP**\n\nI only make two or three \"high-conviction\" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.\n\nI am not a \"technical\" trader. Nor am I a \"fundamental\" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money \"social arbitrage\" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.\n\nIf you want to read more \"fundamental\" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.\n\n**Background of the Trade:**\n\nMolson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.\n\nTruly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.\n\nThe company got a new CEO who implemented a \"Revitalization Plan\" and is heavily investing in more profitable \"above premium\" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\n* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer\n* Zoa - Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnston's energy drink\n* Vizzy Hard Seltzer\n\n**Thesis of the Trade:**\n\nMolson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.\n\n**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**\n\nWhile the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.\n\nLet me explain:\n\n* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching \"topo chico hard seltzer\" more than \"truly hard seltzer\" and more than \"white claw hard seltzer.\" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.\n* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching \"zoa energy drink\" just as much as \"monster energy drink\" and more than \"red bull energy drink.\" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.\n* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.\n* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a \"healthier\" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.\n* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.\n* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more \"fundamental\" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.\n\nAnyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.\n\nThree final things:\n\n1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent \"Unknown Market Wizards\" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called \"Laughing at Wall Street.\" It's a great read.\n2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called \"Going ALL IN on $TAP\"\n3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called \"Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnson\"\n\nP.S. Obviously, I'm not a financial advisor. This is my due diligence. Don't be lazy - do you own research. Don't listen to someone on the internet. Come up with your own research and make your own conclusions.",
