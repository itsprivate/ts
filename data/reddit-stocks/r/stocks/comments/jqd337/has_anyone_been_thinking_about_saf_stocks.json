  "selftext": "Obviously with Biden winning the election sustainability is on everyone’s mind. Personally, I consider myself a green investor and already built up decent positions in companies like ENPH and RSG..\n\nHowever, the only analysis in terms of green stocks are those in green energy such as solar, wind, solar components, etc. Has anyone done their research on SAF (sustainable aviation fuels)? I work in private aviation and I’ve noticed more and more growth in talk about development and use of SAF over the years. In fact, last year during the WEF there were (I believe) around 30 independent operators who traveled to and from the WEF utilizing SAF. Currently, it’s not widely used due to the premium cost but large-scale manufacturers, like Gulfstream, already have several aircraft which can operate on either traditional Jet A or SAF (such as the G650).  \n\nI was checking out a Market Insider article from April which discussed that the SAF marker is expected to see CAGR of 56% from 2020-2024. This is a pretty consolidated market with only a few players. I was wondering if anyone is checking this out? I think it can be a HUGE investment opportunity given our increasing push for green initiatives and electric doesn’t really work for jets. The article mentions HON, GEVO, NTOIY, and some others as notable companies in this space. I need to conduct further DD but wanted to get other people’s thoughts?",
