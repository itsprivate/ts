So I decided to buy VTI and a couple of other ETFs at around the $120/$200mark. With some leftover cash, I pumped money into stocks that I read in news articles. That's right, I would look up \"the best stocks of march 2020\" and basically buy the first thing on the list on some random article. I guess I got lucky and made about 4k - a 30% return overall. \n\nThen comes GME, BB, AMC, etc. I basically lost about $2500 total because of FOMO. That chewed up a lot of my profits, but it was okay because it was money I could lose. I'm glad that it wasn't worse. It was a huge eye-opener though because I realized that I had around 5-8k in certain stocks that I did absolutely 0 research on besides using the google search bar. Likely these investments could've dropped to 0 but thankfully didn't.\n\nThe moment I lost that amount of money on the speculative stocks, I liquidated all my positions except for some ETFs. It didn't matter if I was up or if the stock was likely to get gain xx%. I decided that as a DYI investor, I needed to understand fundamentals: reading and analyzing statements, industrial comparison, etc. I also needed to have a general understanding of the economy, and maybe even understand Technical Analysis. I needed to become a prudent investor and not invest unless I understood every aspect of the company. \n\nI missed out on a lot of gains these past X months (besides my ETFs), but I have no regrets. I will continue learning each and every day until I'm confident enough to invest again. Even then I could lose money but at least I'll know I tried my best. I would also like to encourage anyone else that doesn't have a sense of what's going on to take a step to the side and look at the situation. If you are reading someone's DD and 1/2 of the terms don't make sense, it's probably a good idea to take a step to the side to learn about them before doing blind investing (gambling).",
