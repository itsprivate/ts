Re-balancing didn't seem like a good option because I didn't want to sell e.g. SPOT at a loss to chase a gain which may never come.* \n\nI tried to just stay away from the news, but then I don't learn anything. And then everybody suddenly starts asking me why I didn't just buy dog$shit coin. Or even worse, people tell me about their 2020 gains and how loosing 20% is, like, nothing because they're still up 150%. \n\nHow do you deal with all of this? It's not even loosing money as such that bothers me, it's the feeling of being a complete failure. Is this something that goes away over time? Did you find methods to retain some inner peace and confidence, or did you have that kind of personality to begin with? \n\nI'm really looking for some advice.",
