Remember that mainstream media has its own agenda and the CEO or hedge fund manager being interviewed is typically only there to benefit themselves.\n\nI start looking for sectors with potential price movement based on the direction I think the world is going and come up with trade ideas which will later be used as a starting point for due diligence.\n\n>EXAMPLE 1: News reports about climate change. Democratic leader Joe Biden becomes president and has made climate change a priority. Biden wants to increase jobs and green technologies. Automotive manufacturers to start producing more electric vehicles.  \n>  \n>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long EV car production. Short oil.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>EXAMPLE 2: Frequent news reports about pandemic. People stay at home instead of going to the workplace.  \n>  \n>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long remote working, DIY home renovation. Short travel, hotel, cruise.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>EXAMPLE 3: Recurring news reports about companies getting hacked which leads to more businesses being concerned about their digital security.  \n>  \n>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long security companies. Short company that got hacked.\n\n*The trick is to get really good at the skill of understanding what's going on but isn't being widely discussed yet. Do this by consuming lots of information from a variety of sources to the point where a logical conclusion or prediction can be made about what is likely to happen in the future within a specific sector and time frame.*\n\nNot all the information consumed should be via media. Before covid a great technique was to simply take note of which stores are extraordinarily busy at the shopping mall and ask why is this store busy but not that one?\n\nAnother great way to discover new stocks is to talk with industry experts.\n\n>I remember chatting with a friend way back in 2009 who worked in marketing for a digital agency and they kept talking about this cool new tool called Salesforce because of how much it's helped them with their job.\n\nAfter identifying a potential stock or sector that interests me, I'll start looking for top performing ETFs within the same sector. Then inside those ETFs I'll look for the top 3 names that frequently appear inside those ETFs. Sometimes the ETF itself is the best decision, sometimes it's not.\n\nFor each of those top 3 I'll look at their annual reports.\n\n* Do they have revenue? Why not?\n* Is revenue rising or falling quarterly? How about annually?\n* Do they have debt?\n* Is debt rising or falling?\n* Does leadership have years of relevant experience?\n\nNext I'll look at the chart as zoomed out as it can go. What's the trend? Up, flat, down?\n\nThen I'll zoom in the chart notch by notch looking for the trend. Annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, 30mins, 15mins, 5mins, 1min.\n\n**I buy when I've identified potential price movement, the price is low, and is hovering around a level that has support.**\n\n**I sell when I need the cash to invest in something else or when I no longer believe in the future of the company or sector.**\n\nI don't pay attention to anybody pumping a stock with emojis. Why? Because emojis are used to represent emotion and if you make an investment or trade decision based on emotion or hype you're doing it wrong and in most cases are probably too late anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr;\n\nSpend 80% of your \"investing time\" coming up with original trade ideas and 20% on technicals and charts when you execute the trade.\n\nIf you aren't trading with your own ideas and instead choose to follow someone else's buy recommendation then I hate to break it to you, but you'll probably end up buying into someone else's exit strategy and become a bag holder for days, weeks, months or even years to come just waiting for that big turnaround day which may never come.",
