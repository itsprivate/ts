This week I want to discuss just 1 major huge blunder.. No matter how great we are we all have made at least 1 mistake this past year.\n\nSo please share with us 1 or more mistakes you have made so that others do not, or hopefully not make the same mistake. As a start I will tell you all my main mistake, how I fell into that mistake/why and where I should and will likely cut my losses in the future.\n\nI actually have 2 major mistakes this past year but they are in the same field. The mortgage sector. I was actually trading 5 names, but got stock in 2. I was trading LDI, HMPT, RKT, UWMC and COOP. The reason being that the mortgage sector was hugely profitable. They make cash hands over fists. They can do buybacks, special dividends and they do!\n\nSo what happened? The 4th quarter of 2020 was absolutely smashing for the whole sector. All 5 at that time were making new highs. RKT and UWMC got the Reddit retail status. RKT, UWMC were actually doing buybacks and special dividends. LDI, which I am down a lot on actually smashed earnings badly, announced a special dividend first, a regular dividend….so how would you know not to buy? HMPT reported, the report was amazing. This was actually 10.50 after hours…. Then RKT reported \\[The market leader\\] the entire sector was a sinking ship. LDI and HMPT never recovered UWMC and RKT with their social media fame did for some time, but those 2 were stuck.\n\nWhat should I have done? Next time a market leader misses a report, and warns of margins I will sell at least half my position..if not more. It is usually the case that if the market leader shows weakness it may spread…what happened on the 2nd quarter report ending 6/30… HMPT and LDI laid eggs, which were foreshadowed in RKT’s report.\n\nWhat was I waiting for? COOP reported earnings first before the whole sector… COOP beat by 3 dollars…. COOP is not the industry leader. I had it in my head to take the loss on LDI at 12, HMPT at 6….. I did not pull the trigger, after they released reports it went straight down……\n\nSo what I learned is sell at least half!! Unless you do not mind waiting. They will be fine and are not going anywhere but I would rather not wait 3-6-9 months. \n\nPlease share blunders so we can all try and get some ideas of what to do if we are in a similar situation. Thank you and have a great night/weekend.",
