I think we will see continued growth because people are planning their trips and it's a lucrative market.\n\nIn the long-term I'm bullish on it being one of the more effective forms of social media with respect to e-commerce and advertising effectiveness. A user may go on Instagram and spend more time, resulting in no net gain for an advertiser.
