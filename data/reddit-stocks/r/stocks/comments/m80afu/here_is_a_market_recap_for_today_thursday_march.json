  "selftext": "Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks. Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq\n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”\n\nAs of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control.
