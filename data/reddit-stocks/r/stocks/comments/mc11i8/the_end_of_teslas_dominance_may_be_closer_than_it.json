Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.\n\n\\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).\n\n\\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.\n\n\\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years\n\n\\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)\n\n\\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models\n\n\\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)\n\n\\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from \"legacy\" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves\n\n\\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think \"only EV after year xxxx\" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOpinion:\n\n\\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with\n\n\\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour. \n\nPS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.",
