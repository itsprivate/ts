Sold low, then the holding popped up hugely the next few days. So then I bought back higher, at half my original allocation, only to see it bleed down once again. On the sale, I made a 20% cap gain, and I'm happy to have an allocation I am comfortable with now. But it was an interesting experience and some valuable lessons learned: \n\n1. set limits on allocation\n\n2. don't get (too) greedy\n\n3. don't listen to redditors deriding you for your decision. and certainly don't let them influence any decision going forward. In the end, you may be right, they may be wrong. they don't know you or your portfolio. better yet, don't post your investment decisions on reddit in the heat of the moment!\n\n4. have conviction in your decision. know the current (negative) environment and why you made your decision. base it on hard numbers. selling in a downturn isn't bad in and of itself. set conditions at which you would reconsider buying back in the future. if you don't have conviction, then do nothing.\n\n5. remember why you entered into the position in the first place. has anything fundamentally changed?\n\n6. it's just paper money until you sell.\n\n7. FOMO is a b#%ch. don't let it control you. if the holding pops back up you really really need #4. plus downturns are sawtoothed, not straight down. if the negative environment hasn't changed, snap backs are common, before a further downturn takes place.",
