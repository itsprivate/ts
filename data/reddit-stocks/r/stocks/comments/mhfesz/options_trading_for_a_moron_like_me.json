Honestly I gotta say he was more polite and understanding than I would have been with someone as stupid as I am. I said I read books and watched videos. Actually other people read books and told me about it and I watched YouTube videos. I asked him what level access do I need to short stocks and I said it with a straight face. He said I'd need a margin account, so I asked what level could I trade options without margin and he gave me level 1 access. Tbh, I'm surprised he let me have that.
