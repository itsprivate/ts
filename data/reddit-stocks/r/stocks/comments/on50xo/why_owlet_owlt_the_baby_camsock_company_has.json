  "selftext": "**Intro:** Owlet (OWLT), a company who helps parents keep their babies safe and greatly reduce the risk of SIDS (the leading cause of death among infants), has likely become the most shorted stock in the world. WTF? Yes, but how is this possible and why are short interest websites not showing this yet? Read on to find out:\n\n**Background:** OWLT just officially IPO'ed last Friday after going public through a SP@C (formerly SBG) and so all the financial websites have not updated its short interest and/or total float yet. One of the unique things about a SP@C is that right before the official IPO or \"merger,\" a shareholder can trade in their shares for their net asset value of $10 instead of actually holding shares in the company. What’s been happening recently though is that large hedge funds buy up all the shares they can get at \\~$9.98 right before merger and then trade them in for their $10 cash trust value for a guaranteed 0.2% profit. For every share that is traded in, the company will receive $10 lesson funding and there will also be one less share in the total float after the official IPO.\n\n**The Short Position Is Taken:** With SP@Cs getting smacked across the board recently, a profitable strategy has been to short shares prior to the official IPO since that is when the $10 floor is removed for a [SP@C](mailto:SP@C). Therefore, Hedge Fund ABC sees an opportunity in shorting OWLT in anticipation of it dropping in price after merger. So, they short as many shares (1.77 million) as they can.  More specifically, a large chunk of those shares were shorted at the end of June when the stock was at $10, which for the most part would only be done by a principle short planning to hold their short into deSP@C (merger). At the time, OWLT had 23 million shares total, so it wasn’t THAT high of a short interest ratio.\n\n**The Total Available Shares Reduces by 86%:** As mentioned in the background, there have been an increasing amount of SP@C shares bought by hedge funds and traded in to secure a 0.2% profit. So, Hedge Fund XYZ decides to do this with OWLT, which was trading at $9.97-9.98 for about a month before the official IPO date. Ultimately, they buy up an incredible 86% of the float trade them in for $10 before merger. Sure, Owlet now has 86% less of the cash in the SP@C trust  to make their life-saving baby products but oh well, hedge funds gotta get paid their 0.2% ya know? As a result, this removes 86% of the shares available from the total float, which means that the original 23 million float is reduced to only 3.24 million shares.\n\n**Putting It Together:** With these two moves, OWLT now has a float of only 3.24 million shares with 1.77 million of those shares sold short based on the most recent data from the end of June. (Could there more or less shares shorted since that time? Yes, but I'm guessing if anything short interest got even higher since almost every SP@C these past two weeks has been dropping like a fly after their official IPO debut, further confirming the hedge fund's short strategy.)\n\nWith 1.77 million shares sold short, this would equate to a short interest ratio of 54.6%, which according to [highshortinterest.com](http://highshortinterest.com/) would make it by far the most shorted stock in the world with second place coming in at 39.14%. They don't have OWLT at the top of the list right now because financial websites have not updated the total available float as the company technically just went public on Friday (July 16).\n\nGiven the information, I wouldn't want to be short the stock in a situation like this. I'm betting that the people who are, are unaware of the situation and might get caught very off side. Being caught off side, in size, is a very tough spot to be in especially considering the low volume/float. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the coming days.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Hedge Fund ABC shorts OWLT as much as they can (1.77 million shares) before the official IPO date and $10 floor is removed.\n* Hedge Fund XYZ buys up as many of the shares as they can (86% of the float) and trades them in to make 0.2% profit, subsequently reducing the total available float by 86%.\n* As a result, based on the latest data, OWLT now has a total float of only 3.24 million shares with 54.6% of those shares shorted. With this small of a float and high of short interest, Hedge Fund ABC's short position would be incredibly vulnerable if people start to catch on.\n\n**Data backing this thesis:**\n\n[Bloomberg terminal screenshot showing total amount of shares shorted at 1.77M](https://imgur.com/a/huRQv9P). Note: the total float hasn't been updated yet, which is why % float short only says 7.68.\n\n[Shortsqueeze.com also verifying short interest data for OWLT at 1.77M shares](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/SBG.htm) (OWLT was formerly known as SBG back when it was a [SP@C](mailto:SP@C). OWLT's price is now $9.10)\n\n[8-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001816708/000114036121024354/brhc10026886_8k.htm) showing that 19.76 million shares were traded in or \"redeemed\" and therefore only 3.24 million shares remain: *\"A total of 19,758,773 shares of Class A common stock were presented for redemption in connection with the Special Meeting (the “Redemptions”). As a result, there will be approximately $32.4 million remaining in the trust account following redemptions.\"* (Note: originally, there were 23 million shares available for a total trust value of $230 million).\n\n[PIPE participants were not allowed to short, and their shares won't be registered and added to the float for many weeks. This indicates it was someone shorting OWLT to profit and not to box in their investment position](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816708/000114036121004864/nt10020073x2_ex10-1.htm): *\"* *Term 10, subsection 10: n.* *The Investor hereby acknowledges and agrees that it will not, and will cause each person acting at the Investor’s direction or pursuant to any understanding with the Investor to not, directly or indirectly offer, sell, pledge, contract to sell or sell any option to purchase, or engage in hedging activities or execute any “short sales” as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act in respect of, Sandbridge’s Class A common stock until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (or such earlier termination of this Subscription Agreement in accordance with its terms).\"*\n\n[This other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ola0rw/a_curious_situation_for_sbgs_owlt_float_after_86/) does a great job of diving more into the details and data of how this unexpected situation came about, which helped a lot to inspire this post.\n\n**About Owlet:**\n\nIf you've read this far, I might as well also share a bit about the company itself. From what I can tell, Owlet is actually a pretty good company. Here's their [investor presentation](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1004/3036/files/Owlet_SPAC_Presentation_Deck_Feb-2021_Final.pdf?v=1613532833).\n\nFrom slide 24, you can see their smart sock and baby monitoring product has an NPS score of 76 and 68, which is very high, on par or higher than any Apple product. From slide 24, you can see that they are developing a whole platform of products beyond their smart sock and cam to help parents take care of their babies. On Glassdoor, they have a 4.6 rating and 100% CEO approval. Amazon product reviews are all 4.5+ stars with a Fakespot score of B. Nice.\n\nOn slide 7, it shows their valuation was $1.39B at a price of $10. At its current price of $9.10 and reduced cash position as a result of the shares traded in, the valuation is now $1.1B. Considering that they are growing at \\~50%, have expected 2022 revenues of $175M, gross margins of \\~50%, it honestly doesn’t seem like a bad valuation to me.  Mainly though, I'm in this play for the squeeze.",
