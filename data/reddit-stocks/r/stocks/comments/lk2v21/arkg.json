However when I go through the weightings of ARKG's holdings it seems they are a lot of small and medium cap companies. My worry is that ARK owns around ten percent of these companies and this is quite a risky play.\n\nDoes ARKG manage too much money for them to achieve what they want to do in ARKG or is my logic flawed. I truly believe genomics is a great ten year strategy but is this fund too big to be nimble enough to navigate this volatile area? I notice recently they are buying into bigger pharma companies (Roche, Takeda, Nov) is this just to park cash or is there an actual genomics play here. A quick glance at their pipeline I couldn't find much.\n\nThanks for clearing this up as I'm quite new to this.\n\nI also used https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php to find out the fund overlaps",
