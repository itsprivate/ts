Maybe you give more weight to ideas you have greater confidence in, but in no case should a single position take up more than 10% of your capital unless you're Warren Buffett.\n\nOne very nasty fact of investing is that **compounding works in reverse** as well. If your portfolio suffers a 25% loss, you need a 33% gain to recover; a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. \n\nRealistically most people are financially and emotionally crushed by anything in excess of a 30% portfolio loss. It can take years to recover from blowing up like that, because the engine of compounding has to be restarted all over again.\n\nIf you have appropriate position sizing and do some simple risk management (don't diamond hand it into the dirt...) one bad position cannot blow up your portfolio.\n\nEven the best investor **is not right every single time**. Peter Lynch said he'd be thrilled to be right just 60% of the time. \n\nIf you do bad position sizing, and YOLO the majority of your capital into each position, **even if you could be right 90% of the time** you will eventually hit that 1-in-10 chance and all your gains are gone. \n\nOver in /r/GMEbagholdersclub there are many people who successfully traded up into a 6 figure account, felt like they were on top of the world, and got sent back to square one.\n\nThe other reason to have many positions is it **gives you choices** - the worst part of bagholding a losing position is all your capital is tied up, and it's psychologically difficult to take a big loss and reinvest elsewhere, even if you know you should -- it's better to be able to focus on other positives rather than watching one position drag your entire portfolio down like an anchor.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, this rule does not make exceptions for blue chips or \"oh it's Apple, who cares if it's 40% of my portfolio, I'll never sell...\" \n\nI was motivated to make this post because one stock I own and had a ton of confidence in just missed earnings by $0.02 last week, and got hammered with a 12% price decline in a day. It's a boring dividend stock, and I'd let it grow to over 10% of my portfolio because \"what could go wrong.\" It will come back eventually as the business is sound, but still a nasty shock for a very \"stable and safe\" stock.\n\nMarkets are unpredictable and your best defense against that is to do risk management like a professional. Or just buy index funds.",
