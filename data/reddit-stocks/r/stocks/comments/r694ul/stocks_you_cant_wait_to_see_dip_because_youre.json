I didn’t know at the time just how big of a moat the company had, and when I found out, it was already in the 600s. Had a chance to buy during the September-October sell-off, but set my price level too low (wanted in under 500, but it never dipped under 550). If this thing dips back into the 500s, I’m entering and DCAing down.\n\n2) HD/LOW: Didn’t buy when I started because I saw the big climb on their charts, but these two chains basically have home improvement by the balls. Plus, they pay some handsome dividends. Ideally, I’d love for HD to come back to 300, but that won’t likely happen barring something catastrophic, so maybe the 350s is where I start building a position.\n\n3) GS: I panic sold this one during the last deep correction when I found out it had exposure to Evergrande, and while it was a profitable sell, it’s since leaped back into the 400s. Likely won’t get my original entry price of the 340s, but deep enough pullback will get my attention.\n\n4) ABBV: Had this ticker and panic sold it when it crashed hard that one morning back in September. Only made a few dollars when I was up over $100 at one point. It then started another slow run upward. If it comes back to my original price of 107, I’m re-entering.\n\nYours?",
