I could have taken some off... **I got greedy, or hopeful, or whatever**...\n\nI thought it could go higher... **I held**.\n\nI held on the way down all day long, waiting for a reversal that never came. I am now **down 5%**. I know some other people have lost a lot more than me, but it really hit me hard because I really could have used some gains for a change. It's made a bit worse because I was up almost all day. And I just kept hoping for a reversal, despite the **obvious downtrend and loss of volume**.\n\nIf someone can learn something from my mistake, I don't mind some of you making fun of me. A winning trade can easily turn into a losing trade.\n\nRemember: **\"Nobody ever went broke taking profit.\"**\n\nThank you! Good luck to you all.",
