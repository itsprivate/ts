Let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day\n\nWe also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again & continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small & mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil & Gas companies.\n\nYesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it‚Äôs one of the best for long-term investing.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED‚Äôs Beige Book.\n\nWhile in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it‚Äôs unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it‚Äôs not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.\n\nWe also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It‚Äôs expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It‚Äôs seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.\n\nIn the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK‚Äôs Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren‚Äôt good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.\n\nWe also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain. \n\n üôèThank you everyone for reading!üôè Hope you enjoyed the content!
