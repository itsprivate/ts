Every move is very dramatic. A stock might only move a few cents but their charts make it look like the stock is up or down 30%. Since switching to TD I am able to let everything just sit without getting panicked. I think most money lost in the stock market is due to panic selling so if you can, don’t sell. Stocks pretty much always go up (with time) \n\n2) I don’t trade options anymore.\n\nRobinhood made it so easy to trade options. While I know people can make fortunes off options, more people lose their savings with them. I know I would get skinned alive for saying this at WSB but options are the devils lottery tickets. While I might not have huge swings, trading shares allows to have consistent gains. \n\n\nIn conclusion, this is just what has worked for me.
