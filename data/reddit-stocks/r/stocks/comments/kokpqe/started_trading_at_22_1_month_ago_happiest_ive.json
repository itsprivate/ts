I hope to be able to contribute $800 a month into the stock market. It's going to take a huge chunk of my paychecks, but I've come to Spend what I don't save , rather than saving what I don't spend. I have a little over $1,000 in my trading account right now, and its the most money I've ever managed to save up in my life. It's felt really good, and I am already ready for 2022, being that if I stay on this route,  it'll be a good year for me! And every year after that :) Happy new years all! And to any of you out there thinking about investing , I say jump in , learn as much as you can, and have fun:)\n\nEdit:\n  OK, so people think I'm claiming a victory lap, and I simply am not. I am just taking a moment in time to reflect on the accomplishment I have made in the last month. I am not saying that this will be positive in every stride , but right now it is positive, and I'd like to simply sit back and enjoy this last months accomplishment today. And maybe next month will be a different story,  but today we celebrate!",
