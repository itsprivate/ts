Targetting people who want to become streamers and selling corsair products is a great way to increase profits within the companies attmosphere. Corsair's CEO expressed interest in streaming boot camps and training. If heading into this direction, Corsair can eat up Chinese market share when looking to create stablized boot camps to create streamers. If Corsair does go in this direction they can create a new revenue source by contracting the streamers they trained, taking a percentage of their profits and advertising Corsair products to the audience.\n\nI see a lot of people compare Corsair to Logitech $LOGI which is fair until you realize that Corsair is more than just a gaming accessories company. They create computers and buy software related to streaming. Logitech is a company that makes products for gamers and trational companies and consumers while Corsair focuses on gamers and now streamers. This difference seems small until you realize that Corsair doesn't have a real direct competitor.\n\nThe blue ocean strategy approach Corsair has taken to be able to cement themselves into the gaming community will pay off 10 fold in the future. I believe that Corsair will be synonyms with gaming and gaming culture making it worth more because of the brand rather than the fundemental book value.\n\nI believe that paying anywhere $38.50 - $42.60 per share is a good investment for **short-term** investors. As a **long-term** investor buying in at any price will pay off in 5 to 10 years.\n\nCorsair Gaming has a lot to offer and I am excited to see where it goes in the future.\n\n# Sources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr](https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://fintel.io/ss/us/crsr](https://fintel.io/ss/us/crsr)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://theenterpriseleader.com/2021/02/19/brokerages-anticipate-corsair-gaming-inc-nasdaqcrsr-will-announce-quarterly-sales-of-444-82-million.html](https://theenterpriseleader.com/2021/02/19/brokerages-anticipate-corsair-gaming-inc-nasdaqcrsr-will-announce-quarterly-sales-of-444-82-million.html)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-content-design-corsair-acquires-140000904.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-content-design-corsair-acquires-140000904.html)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/](https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://twitchtracker.com/statistics](https://twitchtracker.com/statistics)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/price-earnings-peg-ratios](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/price-earnings-peg-ratios)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\\_Valuation.php?s=1000](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1000)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/price\\_to\\_book\\_value](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/price_to_book_value)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/debt\\_equity\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/debt_equity_ratio)\n\n\\[11\\] [https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry\\_Financial\\_Strength\\_Ratios.php?s=1000](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Financial_Strength_Ratios.php?s=1000)\n\n\\[12\\] [https://www.finscreener.org/title/key-ratio-history?kpidcp=58766&kpi=5&idcp=58766#:\\~:text=(CRSR)%20is%203.00,-The%20interest%20coverage&text=It%20measures%20the%20margin%20of,debt%20during%20a%20given%20period](https://www.finscreener.org/title/key-ratio-history?kpidcp=58766&kpi=5&idcp=58766#:~:text=(CRSR)%20is%203.00,-The%20interest%20coverage&text=It%20measures%20the%20margin%20of,debt%20during%20a%20given%20period)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/financials?p=CRSR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/financials?p=CRSR)\n\n\\[14\\] [https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-crsr/corsair-gaming](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-crsr/corsair-gaming)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/)\n\n# Disclosure: I own 56 shares @ $38.70 I am not a financial advisor.
