What exactly is driving the stock price up other than people just buying the stock? and why should we see 130$ stock price on GME if it’s going out of business? When do people plan to buy if they haven’t already and when do they plan to sell? Is Monday a day to buy?! I know nobody can predict with 100% accuracy the stock market but what makes people confiant it won’t drop to 13$ by Tuesday? Thanks!",
