I put my savings (about 5k) into some ETFs with good dividends, Grayscale crypto trusts, and bought 1 share of ABBV (bought in mid-March), BRK-B, XOM, CVX and REGN (which I bought in early March). I recently put in another few thousand into some tech stocks that fell a lot early this week - CRM, NVDA, BIDU, BABA, XLK, U, along with a few others.

If so, which ones should I have on my watchlist?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
