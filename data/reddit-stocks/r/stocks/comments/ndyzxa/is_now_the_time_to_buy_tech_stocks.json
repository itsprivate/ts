I do't know if you guys will be looking at this on the weekend...\n\nI was hoping some more experienced investors could provide some advice for me, a new trader.\n\nI turned 18 at the beginning of this year and created a brokerage account (TD Ameritrade). I put my savings (about 5k) into some ETFs with good dividends, Grayscale crypto trusts, and bought 1 share of ABBV (bought in mid-March), BRK-B, XOM, CVX and REGN (which I bought in early March). I recently put in another few thousand into some tech stocks that fell a lot early this week - CRM, NVDA, BIDU, BABA, XLK, U, along with a few others. My money has grown a fair amount.\n\nSo, should I put some more money into tech stocks and other stocks that fell this week? If so, which ones should I have on my watchlist?",
