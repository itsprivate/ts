Under that assumption, shouldn't that mean it would be smarter to sit these next few years out until they end up raising rates and then open long positions? I recently purchased 10 LEAPs on various growth/tech companies and plan to exercise them in the future. Would it have been smarter to just wait for the rate hikes later on or how much of that is already being priced in the market today? I plan to be these positions 5-10+ years so I'm just curious.",
