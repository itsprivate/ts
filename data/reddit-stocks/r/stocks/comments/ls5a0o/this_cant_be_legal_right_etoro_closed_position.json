This was obviously worrying as the downside risk of my trade had increased a lot; but I still had faith in my decision and watched it climb back into a profit, before I had the chance to sell, Etoro had MORE technical issues, this time locking me out for the entire evening/morning.\n\nWhen It allowed me back in my trade had been closed just hours before, when the market was well above my stop-loss level. I started emailing Etoro for help and they claim to have retroactively closed my position for the price that the stop-loss would have activated.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. The same technical issue that stopped me from selling in a profit, stopped their stop-loss from closing my trade\n2. They closed my trade without my consent, and I did not receive even close to market value at the time of my trade being closed\n3. If we are able to retroactively pick a point on a chart where I *should* have sold, but didn't due to ETOROs *technical issue* why at the point of maximum loss and not maximum gain (or at least where I tried and was signed out)?\n\nI have tried to contact Etoro support, but they sent one canned response saying what they did, and have stopped answering.\n\nI understand I entered a risky position, I am ok with the risk of losing due to the market, but it seems like Etoro made it impossible for me to do anything but lose the maximum amount here.\n\nI am using Australian Etoro if it makes a difference.\n\nWhere can I go from here? Any advice?",
