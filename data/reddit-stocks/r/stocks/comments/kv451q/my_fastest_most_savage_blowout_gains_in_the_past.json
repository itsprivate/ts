You don't want to post about tiny stocks and then watch them pump and dump and get extremely erratic. Also, the system will delete any posts with some microcap stock names in them, even if they are casual comments and not OPs. But I did find a representative ETF for this small but exploding sector, it's the Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF, BDRY. So I can post some information using BDRY as a proxy for the sector.\n\nHere's a chart of BDRY's stock prices in the past couple of years with a couple of other dry shipping stocks: [https://imgur.com/cK86Dd9](https://imgur.com/cK86Dd9).\n\nThe thing that the chart can't show, because BDRY doesn't go back that far, is how much dry bulk shipping has dropped since Trump's trade war began to ramp up in 2018. Trump's approach to trade and national economic management backfired in the US by dragging down US exports more than its trade partners, and so the US trade deficit has grown in the past few years while China's exports have grown. One thing that has driven dry bulk shipping in recent days/weeks is China's spiking need for transports, so China's trade has grown into the current carrying capacity of dry bulk shipping.\n\nSo here's the big picture: China's trade needs (both import and export) have grown into the current carrying capacity of global dry bulk shipping, and at the same time we are in both (1) a COVID-19 related consumption low in dry bulk shipping that will lift when lockdowns do, and (2) a multi-year, decade low in dry bulk shipping due to Trump's backfired trade war, that will most likely fade as Biden faces the need to restart the trade alliances and stimulate the US economy with more trade. At the time I started investing in these stocks, I was expecting them to multiply by a factor of 10x at least. Now, I expect something less than that going forward because of the big run up in shipping stocks, but I still see at least a doubling of these stocks in 2021 and lockdowns start to lift as well as naval stocks starting to draw investment again (naval stocks, unlike airline stocks, haven't seen pre-vaccine investor interest yet).\n\nI wanted to get a dry bulk shipping post in because it's as sure of a thing as I know of in terms of rebound recovery stocks. I hope someone finds this helpful!\n\nEdit: BDRY is up big again today, 14% in the morning\n\nEdit 2: Because dry bulk shipping businesses have high margin and stable assets (ships), they aren't normally high growth stocks and some of them pay some of the highest dividends out there. So this is a generational opportunity for dividend portfolios, in case your dad's retirement portfolio could use some major growth.",
