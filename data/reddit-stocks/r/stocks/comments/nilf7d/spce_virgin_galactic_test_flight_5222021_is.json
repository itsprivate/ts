VMS Eve and VSS Unity have taken to the skies above Spaceport America, New Mexico.\n\n\\- VMS Eve is taking VSS Unity to a release altitude of 44,000ft. The climb to release will take approximately 60 minutes.\n\n\\-  VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now at 30,000 ft, nearly half-way to release altitude.\n\n\\-  Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.\n\n\\-  Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.\n\n\\-  Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity reaches apogee.\n\n\\-  VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.\n\n\\-  The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.\n\nA successful test flight + landing!\n\nEDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.\n\nEDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).\n\nEDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.\n\nCongrats to fellow bagholders, this was a fun one to watch!",
