You are hoping the stock price will fall and you can buy it back at a later date for less money than you sold it and return the stock back to your broker. With this option you have limited gain (because at some point the stock with worth nothing) and unlimited risk of loss if the stock price shoots up.\n\nWith put options you purchase the right to sell at a strike price (please correct me if I’m wrong) which ideally would be above CMV.  Buying put options you can only lose as much money as the contracts cost (as opposed to short selling where if the stock price keeps going up you lose more and more money) and as the price of the stock drops the value of your put contract goes up exponentially. \n\nSo why would someone choose to short sell vs buying put contacts? I just don’t see any advantages to short selling.",
