Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I’m not worried and you shouldn’t be either. \n\nI would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren’t index fund or “safe” investors. You’re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. \n\nFor reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:\n\n“Safer” steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. \n\nMega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.\n\nMore speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.\n\nThat’s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I’m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That’s what has been getting hit as of late. I’m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I’ll continue to average down through DCA. I’ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few “safer” companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it.",
