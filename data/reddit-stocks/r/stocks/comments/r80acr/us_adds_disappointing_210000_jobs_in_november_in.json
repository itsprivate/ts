Economists say the official rate likely underestimates the true level of unemployment by a few percentage points, however.\n\nIn another encouraging sign, the size of the labor force grew substantially. Some 594,000 people rejoined the labor force in November, based on a separate survey of households. The so-called rate of participation rose two ticks to 61.8% and reached the highest level since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe household survey also showed a much larger 1.14 million people found work in November, but it’s a more volatile number than the poll of businesses from which the government derives the official increase in employment.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-november-11638537320?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-november-11638537320?mod=mw_latestnews)",
