  "selftext": "Blink Charging Co, headed by CEO Michael D. Farkas, claims to own, operate, and provide electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networks throughout the United States. It currently offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment and utilizes a real-time cloud-based system to track the current usage and operation of its EV charging stations. Currently, Blink claims to have over 15,000 of these EV charging stations in operation throughout the U.S. And closing today with a share price of $36.98, Blink seems to give investors and analysts alike hope that it has great prospects to become a large firm in the EV charging space. However, as I'll discuss in further detail, everything about this company - its operations, financials, and leadership - are rotten to the core. \n\n*Data for this post was* [*sourced*](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_BLNK_8-19-2020.pdf?ver=1615557473084) *from the Culper Research Report on Blink Charging Co, published in August of 2020. I have no reason to believe that significant changes have occurred since.*\n\n*I am not an analyst or financial professional nor do I have any positions (or plan to open any) in Blink Charging Co.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 15,000 charging stations sounds impressive compared to Tesla's 5000; 2,192 does not.\n\nAccording to Culper Research's inquiries, \"Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers. Our analysis of the Company’s own data suggests that the average charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per day (0.39% to 2.65% utilization), while annual charging revenue of a mere $6.37 per member suggests that the average Blink member doesn’t even obtain one single full charge from the Blink network over the course of an entire year.\" \n\nIn terms of charging stations, \"As of June 30, 2020, the Company had 15,151 charging stations deployed, of which, 5,385 were Level 2 commercial charging units, 102 were DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 1,193 were residential charging units. Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, the Company had 305 Level 2 commercial charging units on other networks and there were also 8,166 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations.” \n\nWhy's that important? Well, \"Unless Blink expects that all residential charger owners are set to open their garages for complete strangers to steal their electricity, the Company’s claim that “EV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging \\[stations\\]” is an egregious overstatement which we suspect has been designed to mislead investors.\"\n\nAnd of the 5385 charging stations remaining, fewer are listed by the company's own app, \"Our sampling suggests that of the 3,275 chargers listed on the Company’s map, only 67% of these, or 2,192, exist, are functional, and are publicly accessible.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Blink's earnings compared to compensation expenses shed light on its true purpose.\n\nCulper also found that, \"Since 2014, compensation expense of $44 million is more than double the Company’s $18 million in cumulative revenues, which have remained flat despite the Company’s incessant promotion of supposedly groundbreaking partnerships, international expansions, and new technology under development.\"\n\nBut for a mid-cap company valued at $1.5 billion, only 88 employees are on LinkedIn. \n\nBut how does tanking the company help executives? Culper states, \"Farkas has now dumped at least 1.8 million shares over the past 2 years while at least 7 executives and board members have left the Company. This mass exodus has culminated with COO James Christodoulou in March 2020. Christodoulou is now suing Farkas and the Company, citing numerous counts of securities fraud. Also in March 2020, the Company’s primary lender and 9.9% shareholder – Justin Keener – was charged by the SEC, which cited toxic convertible lending practices... Thus, Blink has turned to the PPP program, taking a loan which it has already burned through and does not intend to repay.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Michael Farkas has done this before.\n\nBelow are three separate instances of Farkas' involvement in fraudulent schemes that parallel what's happening with Blink.\n\n\"Skyway Communications (formerly SWYC) purported to be “developing a ground to air in-flight aircraft communication network that we anticipate will facilitate homeland security and in-flight entertainment.” However, this was effectively a front. In 2006, an aircraft was seized by the Mexican government holding 5.6 tons of cocaine, reportedly $100 million worth. With Farkas as the company’s largest investor, at one point holding majority ownership, the stock collapsed, and Skyway’s principals were sued by the SEC for the pump-and-dump scheme. Farkas denied knowledge of the scheme, even as Skyway had just 2 employees and shared an office with Farkas’s investment firm, which was a majority owner. \n\nAt GenesisIntermedia, Inc. / Genesis Realty Group, (formerly GENI), Farkas worked with Jeffrey and Darren Glick, Adnan Khashoggi, and Ramy El-Batrawi. The group was sued by the SEC, alleging, in sum, “a scheme to manipulate the stock price of GENI, now-defunct public company, and misappropriated more than $130 million in the process.” This was part of a broader scheme, which also involved Atlas Recreational / Holiday RV Superstores, where Farkas was a majority owner with 59% of the company. As part of this scheme, the SEC also brought charges against MJK Clearing, Inc., a.k.a. “Stockwalk”, which lost more than $200 million and was forced into liquidation. \n\nWith respect to Red Sea Management Limited, Farkas and his Atlas group of companies were sued for fraud relating to co-involvement in Skyway. Red Sea was also involved with several additional public issuers including SLS International, Inc. GeneThera, Inc., and Freedom Golf Corporation. To that end, the SEC also sued Red Sea, alleging that it conducted “fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes on behalf of its clients and laundered millions of dollars in illegal trading proceeds out of the United States to its clients overseas.” Red Sea was also tied to online gambling, money laundering, short-term payday loans, and bootlegged/pirated TV shows.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR and Summary\n\nBlink Charging Company's claim of operating over 15,000 charging units is misleading on two accounts: only 2,192 can be accessed by consumers and the average charger earns a revenue of just $6.37 annually.\n\nBlink's cumulative earnings are abysmal yet employee compensations remain sky-high, $18 million to $44 million since 2014 respectively. Meanwhile, CEO Michael Farkas continues to dump millions of shares and collect a salary of $548,000. \n\nFarkas also has a long history with massive criminal schemes and generally fraudulent behavior. If that's not enough, an 8.88% owner of Blink is also directly tied to the panama papers.\n\nIn conclusion, Blink Charging is just another scam by CEO Michael Farkas. It has courted investors with a vision of the future and a façade of long-term viability. In reality, its slowly bleeding out and the only person benefitting is Farkas.",
