I would still like to invest in gold and a little silver but could use some guidance on some stock picks. I would like a a few dividend stocks, few ETS, Few structurally sound stocks, and maybe 1-2 higher risk ones. I just don't know exactly what will be safe and what will be around for years to come. I have a couple in mind for my portfolio but there's ALOT of stocks to pick from. I'm not asking that you build my portfolio for me, but some guidance or advice on how to choose/build a good portfolio would be awesome!\n\nHave a great day :)",
