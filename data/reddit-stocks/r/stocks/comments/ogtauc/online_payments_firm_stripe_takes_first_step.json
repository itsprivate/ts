Yet this has also deprived it of using its shares as a publicly traded currency to help finance acquisitions and to incentivize employees.\n\nStripe has tapped Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as a legal adviser on its early-stage listing preparations, the sources said. There has been no decision on the timing of the stock market debut, and the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later this year, the sources added. The listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources said.\n\nStripe is considering going public through a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, because it does not need to raise money, said two of the sources, cautioning that those plans could change.\n\n Founded in 2010 by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions every year for millions of businesses worldwide. Its list of clients includes Alphabet Inc's Google, Uber Technologies Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Zoom Video Communications Inc. Early investors Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google’s venture capital arm.\n\nStripe's breakneck growth could result in it challenging Chinese technology giants Ant Group and ByteDance, whose valuations are close to $200 billion, for the title of world's most valuable startup by the time it goes public.\n\nLink: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-online-payments-firm-stripe-takes-first-step-toward-blockbuster-2021-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-online-payments-firm-stripe-takes-first-step-toward-blockbuster-2021-07-08/)",
