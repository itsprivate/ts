At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.\n\nI recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.\n\nSo demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.\n\nSales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.\n\nWhere does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.\n\nJim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.\n\nOh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).\n\nPersonally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!\n\nI just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.\n\nNIO all the way.\n\nAnd I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nEdit\\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%\n\nEdit 2\\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)",
