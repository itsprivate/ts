Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know.

Be careful whom you take advice from. Especially on Reddit and YouTube. There’s a few users out there that are good, but the majority don’t know what they’re doing half the time.",
