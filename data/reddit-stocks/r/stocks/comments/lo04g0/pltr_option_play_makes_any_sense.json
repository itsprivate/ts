BUY MOAR PLTR. You now have 50 more shares, for a total of 150 shares for an investment of 2900$.\n\n\n\nBullish case: The stock doubles at some point before 2023.... well you receive your investment back (3000$) + 50 shares of the now doubled PLTR, for a nice 100% profits.\n\n\nBoring case: The stock stay at 29$ for 2 years and the option expires. Well... you made 50% profits in 2 years, good job! Again?\n\n\n\nBearish case: The stock drops downs to 20$ in 2 years. Oh well, you broke even... choose a better stock for this strategy next time!
