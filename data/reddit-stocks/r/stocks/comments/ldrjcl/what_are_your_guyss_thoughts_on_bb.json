I am looking to buy my first stocks and I was considering BB due to the fact that their IVY system is going to be used by many of the top car manufacturers’ EV’s. Nvidia has also announced that they’ll be running their self driving AI on the IVY system which I see as very promising. I’ve also seen that Blackberry is in the cyber security business which I see as a plus on top of the IVY system. I’ve seen that Prem Watsa has been betting heavily on Blackberry since September. I don’t see this as a solid piece of evidence in convincing me, but if someone like him has high hopes for it I see that as a good sign. I think EV’s have huge potential, especially with the new president in office and just the way society is moving as a whole. I’m still doing my research but I’d like to hear your guys’s opinions on whether it would be a good idea to invest at this point.  I’m not too familiar with the numbers, in terms of what I should be looking for in Market Cap., and P/E ratio. Any explanations on those would be helpful as well. Thanks.",
