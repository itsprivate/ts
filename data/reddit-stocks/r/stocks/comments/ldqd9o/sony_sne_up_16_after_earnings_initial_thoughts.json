CORE is currently only be available in Bravia TVs and maybe the PS5, but it's supposed to be near loss-less 4K. I also read theatre releases of Sony Entertainment Movies will be available through the streaming service (I haven't done a deep dive to confirm yet).\n\nTheir EV prototype is starting to look like a real project and is a strong example of how their top tech can be used in future cars and not just their sensors. Road testing and safety tests currently taking place.\n\nWith the Huwawei ban one of their top mobile clients might suffer; based on memory I think it makes up 1/5 (could be 1/3) of their mobile clients, which is a big blow. However, the removal of Huwawei is also an opportunity as with the revamped Sony Xperia, Sony is now is a good position to solidify themselves as a top mobile phone choice besides Samsung and Apple (and OnePlus). Their take on the Pro, albeit very niche is an interesting direction for their top line and the Xperia 5 ii is in a nice direction for a consumer phone. (Random Theory: I think the Xperia 5 is called that because 5 = Go in Japanese and it's their compact version, just a random guess).\n\nNot to mention SonyAI, PS5, their monitors/tech being top choice for film industry/pro monitors, cameras etc.\n\nI plan to post a full DD this weekend if I can get around to it, but with the momentum built post earnings they could very well hit $120 Monday morning (hence why I posted now so you can do your own DD if you think it's worth it). \n\nNot financial advice, yada yada do your own DD.",
