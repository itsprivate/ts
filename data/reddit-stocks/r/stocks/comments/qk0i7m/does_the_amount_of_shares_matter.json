He thinks it's better to get stocks like lucid, palantir etc. because they will get me more shares. I didn't really get it and he gave up trying to explain it to me, so can someone else try and explain why it matters? With 1000 dollars, id get around 50 shares of palantir or 1 share of tesla. I don't see why i'd be better of going with palantir because of the number of shares, since they have different values per share.",
