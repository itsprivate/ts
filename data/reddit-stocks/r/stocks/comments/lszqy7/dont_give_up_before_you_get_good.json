I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>The reason people fail at this is that their opening trades that are way too big for their accounts. And when they are wrong, they are set-back so far that after a string of losing trades, they simply cannot afford to continue.</p>\n\n<p>I will give a real-world example. Let&#39;s say I have $1,000,000 in my account. Each trade I open up is rarely above $30,000 to $50,000 dollars or 3% to 5%. And on a $30,000 to $50,000 trade, I&#39;m perfectly happy if I make around $3,000 to $5,000 per trade for the WEEK or even BIWEEKLY! Now that does not seem particularly impressive but if I make 6 trades and 3 of them swing the right way, while the 3 others don&#39;t, it&#39;s still a pretty good week in terms of absolute dollars. On the 3 where I am wrong, I exit at -3% no matter what happens. This ensures that wins on average are at least 3x bigger than my losses. Also, I only actively trade 15% - 20% of my account. Profits from trades go into long-term positions that I never sell and only add to. Now let&#39;s say you start with $20,000. This means each trade should really only be about $1,000. So you&#39;re thinking, &quot;What? I can&#39;t make a living day trading generating a $100 a week per trade on a good week!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>No. You can&#39;t and you shouldn&#39;t. This is why folks should not quit their day job to do this. I didn&#39;t quit my day job to do this until 10 years after I started doing this. And here&#39;s why.</p>\n\n<p>The professional trader and fund managers are not intrinsically smarter than you. They traditionally had more timely information. That gap has been narrowed with the internet. Where professionals and funds beat you is scale. Here&#39;s an exaggerated example. If I can buy 100,000 shares and you can only buy 100, and both of us need $50 today to pay bills, I have virtually no risk whereas you need to hope for a 50% daily return. Most traders who do this at home for income do not make a huge amount of money. I certainly don&#39;t. But a large account built over time allows the trader to risk less and less to maintain the same income year over year. Huge funds make shit trades every day. But each trade is less than a fraction of 1% of their book. So stop beating yourself up. The reason you&#39;re not doing well is your account is simply too small and you&#39;re relying way too much on luck. It takes time and dedication to accumulate enough money. Stop telling yourself you should be further ahead as that thinking will kill you. A lot of you literally started a few months ago. Sometimes you&#39;ll have windfalls. Most of the time, trading is boring as shit.</p>\n\n<p>So don&#39;t feel bad if you&#39;re not getting it right away. You have to tune out the posts where you see people posting wins and losses as that will get you to start gambling instead of trading. A lot of you folks are not &#39;bad&#39; at this. For some reason, you&#39;ve just assumed you were &#39;good&#39; without enough evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I&#39;m not particularly stoic or emotionless on big wins and losses. The long-term positions in my account all got hammered these last few weeks. I will still get pumped or upset and I share with a trading buddy. Find yourself a trading buddy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
