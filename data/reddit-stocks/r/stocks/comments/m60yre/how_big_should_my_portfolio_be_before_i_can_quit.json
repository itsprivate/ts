I don’t know why they say this though, but I’m assume they know something I don’t. Thanks :)\n\nEdit: I just realized that I may have used the wrong flair. I don’t think I can change it.. Sorry about that.\n(Looks like the mods changed it to the correct flair) thanks mods :)\n\nEdit 2: TL;DR: How much money do I need invested in an index fund at average return rate to retire. Living off of 10-50k a year?",
