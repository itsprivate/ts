  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.\n\nMarket participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. \n\nAfter a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. \n\nThe rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to \"wash up on our shores.\" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After years of false starts, New York state lawmakers said Wednesday that they had reached an agreement to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use by adults starting next year. The bill is set to be taken up next week by the state Assembly and Senate, lawmakers said.\n* The industry group for cruise operators has called for federal health authorities to allow cruise lines to start sailing out of the U.S. by July and to scrap a framework for sailing resumption that has been in place for nearly five months.\n* Tesla Inc customers can now buy its electric vehicles with bitcoin, its boss, Elon Musk, said on Wednesday, marking a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency's use in commerce. \"You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin,\" Musk said on Twitter, adding that the option would be available outside the United States later this year.\n* Intel (INTC) recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in order to ramp up their capacity to produce chips.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect the price at close\\*\\***\n* Digital Turbine (APPS) target raised by Maxim Group from $85 to $111 at Buy. Stock currently around $72\n* Royal Caribbean (RCL) target raised by UBS Group from %79 to $116 at Buy. Stock currently around $82\n* Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) target raised by Benchmark from $24 to $27 at Buy. Stock currently around $14\n* Adobe (ADBE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $453\n   * Morgan Stanley from $560 to $575 at Overweight\n   * JP Morgan from $585 to $595 at Overweight\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by JP Morgan from $224 to $250 at Overweight. Stock currently around $197\n\n“The investor’s chief problem—and his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.
