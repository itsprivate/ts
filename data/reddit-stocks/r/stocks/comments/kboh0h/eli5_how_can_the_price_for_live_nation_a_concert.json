I’m just trying to get some help understanding the macro-economic factors that could lead to this seemingly impossible situation. \n\nLive Nation is one of the largest live event promoters in the world. They own Ticketmaster and a slew of live event venues across the world. Due to the pandemic, their business has essentially ground to a halt with revenues down over 95% YoY. Despite this, their stock price is currently trading at or above their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe company has a significant amount of cash on hand at 2.63B with a quarterly burn around 500M. So it is unlikely the company will completely fold unless the pandemic is extended for many years. But still, I don’t understand how the valuation of this company by the market could be so high. Once live events do come back, wouldn’t the company be in a significantly worse financial position than before pandemic because of the huge amount of cash burned? Wouldn’t it make sense for this weaker future position to be priced into the stock now?\n\nSorry for the potentially dumb question. I’m new to investing and can’t really wrap my head around this one. What do people see in this stock that I am missing?\n\nThanks so much!",
