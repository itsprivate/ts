  "selftext": "Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.\n\nKarp would rather put his focus on having the company put its \"best foot forward\" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.\n\nHe was asked in the middle of the interview \"How would he entice new commercial customers?\"\n\nHe then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.\n\nThey talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.\n\nHE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the \"INVESTORS\" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.\n\nHe can't on camera \"PUMP\" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.\n\nTLDR\n\nSo about an hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nFoundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.\n\nIntrigued yet?\n\nI plan to hold this 10 years plus.\n\n235 shares@ 24.68, 6x  PLTR 4/1 30c\n\nEdit: title is misleading, more a summary than a full breakdown sorry.",
