It also has this \"double down\" feel. Interest rates didn't ever recover and were cut in half yet again during the covid crisis. The fed is printing far more money then they did back then (though the bail outs were huge). I don't think they ever really stopped (someone else can clarify) injecting money into the economy. I also would like to note that inflation didn't \"get out of control\" but it sure seems things are much more expensive even though the numbers they follow don't show that. \n\nTL;DR These are the things that come to my mind from watching CNBC everyday after work during the financial crisis. The worries of then seem to be similar to the worries of today but they didn't actually play out back then. At the same time it seems we never got \"back to where we were\" when you consider the fed's involvement after 2009. They seem to be perpetually stuck injecting money and keeping rates low. Whenever they try to step away the market throws a tantrum and they come back. Can anyone else make some comparisons as to how this time is different or possibly the same? \n\nBonus Question: Are any signs of a weak economy always going to be the responsibility of the fed to fix it?
