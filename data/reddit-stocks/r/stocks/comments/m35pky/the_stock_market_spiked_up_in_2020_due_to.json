I'd love to hear other perspectives.\n\nFirst, definition of **inflation** from Wikipedia:\n\n> In economics, inflation (or less frequently, price inflation) is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy\n\nWe experienced high inflation in 2020 due to LOW interest rates. There was high demand for money, but the supply of money was increased even more (M3 increased by almost 25% in 2020) due to increased debt at low interest rates. This increased [supply of money, or debt,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) caused spike in prices of stocks, materials, real estates, etc. Items that don't get consumed more when people have more money weren't affected as much.\n\nPrices started to go down this year as interest rates rose. Now that interest rates seem to be kept down and more stimulus are coming, I believe there will be rise in inflation again and stock prices will grow. I don't know if it will be as much as 2020 though.\n\nOn a side note, the stimulus and increased debt helped those in need in the short-term, but it made wealth building assets more out of reach to the poor, and at the expense of people saving cash. Unless interest rates rise and bring down prices, I believe the gap between asset owners and the poor will continue to increase, along with inflation and more debt. How long that will be sustainable, I have no idea.",
