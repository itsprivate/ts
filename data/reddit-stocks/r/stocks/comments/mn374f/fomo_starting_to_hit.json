Shamelessly I took a more active approach to investing right after the GME affair, about 2 months ago.\n\nI don't have a lot of cash, and it was clear that we were coming off of a huge bull run after the Covid crash last year.  I didn't want to throw a whole lot of money into highly-valued stocks or ETFs, like ARKK.  In the end it looks like that was the right decision, at least at that moment.  Now might be a better entry point, not sure, it's also not one that's on my radar.\n\nSo I ended up doing some pretty defensive investments that have done pretty well for me these last 2 months. In fairness, what hasn't done well?  I had limited tech exposure and even those are racing upwards after the little pullback last month.\n\nThe idea, again, was to not pour a lot of money into stocks which were potentially at ATH (sorry, I tried timing the market) and also investing in things that would do alright in the event of a correction, since I don't want to lose this money in the short-to-mid term.  Once again, so far so good.\n\nBut man, it looks like stonks always go up!  Kidding, but this bull run looks like it has no end. Monetary policy is loose.  Economy set to reopen.  Massive stimulus.  What could go wrong? (somewhat kidding)\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I was pretty bearish when I bought in 2 months ago, and now it looks like that prediction could have been wrong, and I'm experiencing FOMO. Can anyone relate?  \n\nI was supposed to hold some dry powder in reserve, and a little bit of an extra cushion in savings, but man right now I just wanna buy buy buy.  Thoughts?\n\n*(I know I will probably be criticized for my investment decisions, have at it, but the point was to see if anyone else is experiencing this feeling of FOMO right now and how you're dealing with it.)*",
