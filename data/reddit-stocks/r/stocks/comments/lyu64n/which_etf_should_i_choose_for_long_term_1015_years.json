I’m going to be playing with stocks alittle, but I’m also planning to build a solid nest egg out of a long term index-based fund. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed down my top 3 to be (in order):\n\nVTI (Vanguard Total Market)\n\nIVV (iShares S&P 500)\n\nVOO (Vanguard S&P 500)\n\nMy main criteria were low expense ratios (these are all at 0.03%), stability, and longevity. I like VTI more than VOO because VOO wasn’t started until 2010, so it’s lifetime yield isn’t a good comparison since it missed the 08-09 crash. VTI has slightly better gains than IVV over its lifetime, but IVV has had better short-term growth. IVV and VOO also had better dividend yields.\n\nMy brain is honestly fried going over all the numbers and I just want to know if it really matters all that much which of the three I choose. Is VTI a good investment over the other two? Is there a better long-term fund I haven’t listed? Any advice is welcome, I’m just trying to make the smart move.\n\nEdit: I’ve gotten great advice so far, thank you very much, but people need to stop spamming Ark etfs. You clearly didn’t read the low expense ratio part. No chance am I paying 0.75% for such a volatile etf. 0.10% is the highest I’m willing to go.",
