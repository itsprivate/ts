Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.\n\nThank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.\n\nLet's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.\n\nWe are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.\n\nHourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  \nBollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  \nMonday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  \n4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  \nBollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.\n\nDaily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  \nBollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  \n4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  \nThis is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.\n\nWeekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  \nBollinger bands are still wide.  \nOur first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.\n\nThe top 6 funds holding BB based from [https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb) have all added to their positions in the last month. Hit ctrl + F and find them on [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb) if you want to see. Don't just take my word for it, I'm dumb. DYOD.\n\nMonthly: Fuck you. Not relevant right now. Shut up.\n\nEvery whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \\~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.\n\nOptions baby, taken from [http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb](http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb) for March 19th, 2021.\n\nTotal Open Interest Calls: 198,238  \nTotal Open Interest Puts: 59,407\n\nPut/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.\n\nThe highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  \nThe highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.\n\nDo I see 8 happening next week? No, I really don't. Are opinions like assholes, everyone has one.  \nCould we close at $10 next week? Absolutely possible. We have signs that we could go in either direction.  \nMax pain next week is $9. Should be easy, but so is yo momma.\n\nMy thoughts for next week? I don't fucking know. I don't have a crystal ball god damn it. Fuck off.\n\nIf I was a magician, I'd say it would be green. About the same % as this week but I have confirmation bias and I also beat my weewee to Kim Possible when I was a teenager. Your guess is as good as mine, but I digress. Lots of signals to go either direction.\n\nThis is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of what's happening and the opinion of a degenerate. I love lamp.\n\nTake care.",
