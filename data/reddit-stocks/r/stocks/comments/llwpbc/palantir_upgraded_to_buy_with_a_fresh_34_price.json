Merwin, CFA, said Palantir posted \"strong FQ4 results\" that beat their revenue and EBITDA expectations by 6% and 115% respectively.\nThey also noted Palantir's robust revenue guidance and backlog of orders going into 2021.\n\n\"We were encouraged to see management guide to $4bn of revenue in FY25, implying a 30% 5-year CAGR from FY20,\" Merwin said. \"With a growing backlog of $2.8bn in deal value (+31% y/y), we believe there is increasing visibility into the achievability of that long-term target.\"\nGovernment revenue was another bright spot for Palantir in its most recent earnings report, rising 85% year-over-year to $190 million. The company signed 21 deals worth over $5 million with contractors during the quarter compared to just 15 a year ago.\nGoldman analysts also said they expect the margin expansion of 63 points seen in the quarter to continue going forward, leading the group to model 23% non-GAAP EBIT, up from 17%.\nFurthermore, Goldman said Palantir's deal with IBM to \"should help to grow what is a relatively small commercial customer count today.\"\nPalantir's quarterly results were enough for Goldman to more than double its price target from $13 per share to $34. The company should now \"trade more in line with 30%+ growth businesses, which are trading at 44x CY21 sales\" according to Merwin and his team.\n\nGoldman's price target implies a 22% potential return from Tuesday's closing price.\nPalantir's stock has risen nearly 200% in the last six months amid a bull market for equities. However, the company saw its shares fall from all-time-highs of over $39 per share on Jan. 27.",
