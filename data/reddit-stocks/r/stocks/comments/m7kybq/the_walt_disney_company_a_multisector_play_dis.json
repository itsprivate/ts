This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it's online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I'm from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott's berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.\n\nMeanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has \"hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.\"\n\nI believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.\n\nMy current positions:  DIS 4/16 200C's",
