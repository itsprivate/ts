This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I’m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it’s better to be cautious and always do your own research first.
