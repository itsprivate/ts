First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:\n\n**Shares Outstanding**\n\nThe TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.\n\n**Shares Float**\n\nThe total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.\n\nPretend: Stock XYZ has *400M shares float*, *50M shares shorted*, and *daily volume of 10M shares*. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.\n\n**Short Ratio**\n\nThe number of *days* it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.\n\n* Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.\n\n**Short Float**\n\nWhat percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.\n\n* Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) \\* 100) shares. So, (50/400) \\* 100 = 12.5%.\n\n**Short Interest** **(Shares Shorted)**\n\nPretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.\n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nWhen stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.\n\nBut… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.  \n\n\n*Edit*: Thanks but please don't give me awards lol. Spend it buying stocks and getting rich. ",
