Workhorse ($WKHS) has been in the ranks for months now after a MASSIVE explosion in June of 2020 due to a potential \"speculation\" of obtaining the new 8.3 Billion (\\~20 Billion over next 10 years in maintenance and infrastructure) United States Postal Service Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Contract (NGDV). They've been in the biding process competing with various other companies since 2015 and it's finally down to the wire with 3 competitors left in the NGDV bid.\n\n**Oshkosh/Ford** \\- Who've submitted an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle and have a history of federal contracts.\n\n**Karsan Motors** \\- A Plug-In Hybrid vehicle owned by a Turkish company.\n\nAND...... **Workhorse** \\- *The ONLY fully electric, American owned vehicle left in the contract.*\n\nIn 2019, Workhorse and Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2 mil square foot GM manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio. Although, its primarily used today for Lordstown Motors, the CEO has been on record saying it will lend WKHS whatever facilities necessary to help them fulfil the USPS contract (Lordstown Motors split off from Workhorse and the CEO's are partners). And **with the recent news form Biden saying the federal fleet will be replaced with fully electric, Made in America vehicles, this is more than in the bag.**\n\nCathie Woods of Ark invest saw this opportunity back in June and has been loading up.
