This plan is spread out over 8 years and will be paid for in new tax hikes. The tax plan is expected to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, end federal subsidies for fossil fuel companies and increase the global minimum tax paid from about 13 percent to 21 percent, as well as other measures aimed at taxing corporations that shelter profits offshore to avoid taxes.\n\nMore details about this plan are here: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $650B to rebuild the country’s infrastructure, such as its roads, bridges, highways and ports\n   * U.S. Stocks:\n      * ROAD (Construction partners) - engineering and construction industry - engages in the construction and maintenance of highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n      * VMC (Vulcan materials),\n      * NUE (Nucor) - sells steel and steel products\n      * CLF (Cleveland cliffs) - steel industry - Iron ore mining company based in the US - three ore mines - one in Michigan, and two in Minnesota,\n      * CMCO - (Columbus Mckinnon corp) - trucks/construction/farm machinery industry -\n   * ETFs:\n      * PAVE - US Infrastructure ETF - no utility companies\n      * IFRA - US Infrastructure ETF with 20 electric utility companies and four water companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $400B toward home care for the elderly and the disabled - A few senior living facilities were hit with COVID and unfortunately took the lives of many of these elderly.

The popular ones used in mainstream commodities (such as electric vehicles, batteries, and energy storage) are lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and copper.\n\nThere was a Global Metals & Mining Live Virtual Investor Conference yesterday and today that saw several companies pitch their companies and talked about what they do and the how the mining business will see a lot of growth for the next several years.\n\nThere's two US based companies that I would recommend and that's MP Materials, ticker symbol, MP and Energy fuels, UUUU. The reason mining rare earth metals is so important for the US is because we have to become independent from other countries to mine, specifically China. China supplied 80% of the rare earth metals to the US from 2014 to 2017 and they supply 75% of the rare earth materials to manufacturers. There is only one US based rare earth mine and that's California's mountain pass mine. Guess who owns it? MP Materials.\n\nI made a spreadsheet list of stocks and ETFs that may see some benefit from this plan.

If you have any suggestions for stocks that will benefit, discuss here!\n\nTLDR: Long TSLA, MP, LIT, ARKX, clean energy stocks.
