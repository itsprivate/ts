That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,” Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)\n\nIn China, the world’s top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.\n\nBut this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.\n\nMeanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).\n\nIn Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country’s Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).\n\nCopper miners gain\n\nDespite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world’s top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.\n\n**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.\n\nCopper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. \n\nGreen initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate plan, and China’s target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. \n\nAlthough mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.\n\nTake [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  \n\nThe big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.\n\nFeb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.\n\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)\n\nMany thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.\n\n**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines**\n\nGlobal copper demand\n\nAs mentioned above, it’s not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.\n\nIn the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.\n\nChina will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.\n\nIndonesian copper smelter\n\nIndonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.\n\n“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.  \n**A reminder:** I am not a personal financial advisor, please do your own research. I’m only a value investor and I like to find value where others shy away from and commodities are the red-headed step child that I believe will shine in 2021 for all the reasons I have laid out here.",
