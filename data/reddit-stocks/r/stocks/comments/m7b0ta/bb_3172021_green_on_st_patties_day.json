  "selftext": "Hey guys!  \n\n\nIt was a solid day today, even with the uncertainty today due to waiting on the fed's decision whether or not to increase the interest rates. Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. \\~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked \\~4% from today's low. That's awesome.  \n\n\nICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023  \nSOURCE: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html)  \n\n\nWhat does this mean, you ask?   \nInterest rates are also known as the \"price of money\". Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  \n\n\nFor the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   \n\n\nFor ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word \"money\" in the sentence above with \"banana\". Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  \n\n\nWhat else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?  \nLow volume. Extremely low volume. From [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com), this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  \n\n\nWe are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there's a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I'm currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:  \n\\-No interest rate hikes  \n\\-$BB still holding that strong uptrend  \n\\-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly  \n\\-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.  \n\\-Triple Witching. Read this if you don't know what this is.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)  \n\n\nWith tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  \n\n\nRight now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.  \nIf $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at \\~14.44.  \n\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  \n\n\nTake care.",
