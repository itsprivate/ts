However, in the short-run (a decade or less) the performance of a stock is also driven by *investor valuation and confidence*, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio. It is perfectly possible for a company to increase its earnings, but for its stock to move sideways or even drop if investor enthusiasm for the stock falls.\n\nFor example, the US economy showed [remarkable growth](https://currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php) from 2000 to 2010, increasing from a nominal quarterly GDP of $10 trillion in 2000 to $15 trillion in 2010 (even including the recession in 2008). However, over that same time period the S&P 500 index [dropped](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices/table/by-year) 300 points from 1,425 to 1,123. What on earth happened? The problem was investor confidence and P/E was at an all time high in 2000 at the top of the dot-com bubble, which then plummeted after the bubble burst, and then plummeted again during the global financial crisis. Even though the US economy did great that decade, the S&P 500 did not.\n\nOf course, I cannot predict the future, but investors should be prepared if history repeats itself the next decade. The current S&P 500 [Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (CAPE) is at an almost record high of 37. Assuming a historically consistent growth rate of 10% over the next decade, the S&P 500 will more than double in value. However, if over that decade the CAPE falls to a more realistic historical average of 16, then *all those gains will be wiped out*. It is very possible for the US economy to do great the next decade, but for the S&P 500 to move sideways.\n\nIn light of this possibility, what is an investor to do? Oddly enough, my advice is the same as the exuberant post that prompted this reply, but for a different reason. Existing investors at the start of 2000 went nowhere over the next decade, but they performed marvelously the decade after when the S&P more than tripled to its current valuation of over 4000. In fact, 2000 to 2010 was one of the greatest decades ever to invest in the stock market, since you spent 10 long years buying great US companies at a bargain price. If the stock market drops again in the future, you should ride it out and keep investing into index funds or solid companies that will weather the storm and recover once investor confidence increases again.",
