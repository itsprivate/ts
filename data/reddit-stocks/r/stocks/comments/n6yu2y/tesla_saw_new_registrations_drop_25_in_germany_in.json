The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”\n\nAnyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”  \n\nI am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months. \n\nAnd no, this isn’t intended to be a detailed DD, so don’t come at me for that. :). Just sharing what I read this morning.\n\nEDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.   \n\nVW:\n\n2019: 75k\n\n2020: 230k\n\nTesla\n\n2019: 370k\n\n2020: 500k",
