They have the SoFi Stadium that’s hosting multiple big sports events such as the the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games in 2028. Concerts coming from some big artists in the next few years. I’m sure that doing this will get their name out substantially! They are a one stop shop with possibly bigger plans in the future. Is thinking their stock will hit $100 in the next 5 years a stretch or am I not alone in believing this? Does anyone else have bullish theories on this company and their stock? Is there any bearish theories also? I want to know your opinions on this amazing company.",
