Instead, he suggests looking for great companies and then go all in if the price is fair. Great companies you can hold for many many years. I think this is an amazing advice that I certainly adopted.\n\nI've noticed that there's a lot of psychology behind evaluating if a stock is at a fair price.  When I want to buy a new stock, I would be very critical of the price. I will look at all the metrics and compare it to other companies in its industry, etc. However, after I buy a stock, I'd be much less critical. For example, let's say Shopify today traded at ATH around $1800. I'd probably not buy the stock at it looks expensive and I might get it at a better price in the future. However, if I bought it a year ago at $900 I'd probably keep holding it at $1800 cause I believe it's a great company that will keep growing.\n\nIgnoring tax implications of holding vs selling (short vs long term gain), we can say that every time we decide to hold a stock we make a decision to buy it. Why do we more likely to hold than buy? I think that's because the psychology of making and losing money. If I buy Shopify at $1800 and tomorrow it goes down to $1600, I'll lose money. No one likes to lose money. If I bought it at $900 and it went to $1800 and then $1600, I'm still happy with my return.\n\nI think another reason for holding is that it's easier. If you sell you need to find something else to invest in that you think will give you better returns. Once we found a company that has given us nice returns we're happy with, it's just easier to keep betting on it, even though it doesn't always work (winners keep winning until they don't).\n\nI wonder how you deal with the hold or sell decision? Do you often take short term profits and exit a position unlike Buffet's advice to hold for many years? Do you alway set stop losses to ensure your profit doesn't go below a certain price? etc.",
