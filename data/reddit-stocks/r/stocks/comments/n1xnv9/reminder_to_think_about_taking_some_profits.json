I realize how beat up EV, weed and micro caps are (though they did bounce this week).  We are at the quarter end. The big earnings week is coming to a close. Earnings were \"as expected\" even though the spin is \"exceeded expectations.\" The expectation of investors was that these companies would exceed expectations which is why the beginning of the month had so many buyers.\n\nThere is going to be selling pressure over the next few days (maybe weeks). Lots of people sell after earnings simply because they don't want to hold for another three months and there are no positive catalysts in the near term to move the stock. This doesn't mean the company did anything wrong but the share price does come down. If there are enough buyers on the sidelines the prices won't move much but there will definitely be an increase of sellers out of some positions. \n\nMoving on to next quarter. There are a lot of supply issues and increased costs that many companies noted in their earning calls. We all know about the semi-conductor issue. Raw material costs are approaching all time highs in many sectors. Companies are raising their sale prices. The full impact of these issues won't be fully realized until the next earnings call but in preparation for that people are moving out of some of those stocks that they feel are most vulnerable. \n\nAlso of note, as many in this forum have noted, the investments made over the \"Covid crash\" are now at their \"long term\" status and profit taking due to this will occur (is occurring) as well. \"Sell in May and go away\" is a load of crap but many people know the saying and CNBC (among others) will be using it liberally. \n\nThese are just facts I am pointing out that are working against the market in the near term. It is your decision whether it matters or not to you. Among this will also be the \"jobs, inflation, rate hike, covid, stimulus, etc\" drama over the next few weeks (as is the usual). That can go either way and nobody knows anything for sure. There will definitely be a lot of reporting about summer travel after Covid! This will boost the re-opening plays from time to time. Also the infrastructure package will be a talking point to look forward to. \n\nTL;DR There will be selling pressure over the next couple of weeks which could escalate if there are not enough buyers rushing in quick enough. These buyers would hold off if \"bad news\" comes out during that time which would push share prices lower. There is definitely quite a bit of cash waiting for a buying opportunity but that usually takes an 8-10% correction to move in. It will recover over time (as always) but if you were looking to sell in the next few months there is nothing wrong with taking SOME profit at this level. If you are in it for over a year disregard this post. \n\nI am not telling you what to do. I am reminding you to think about what to do. You are responsible for your own decisions. Good luck out there!",
