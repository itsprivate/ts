It was a great/informative discussion that didn’t revolve around “BUY PLTR OR BUY DKNG”\n\nGood DD and suggested plays, enjoy;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jbc4v7/the_next_hot_sector_food_gene_editing_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nFor those who did read or had an interest in it, I just thought I would provide an update on how they are going. I think this sector is going to have a huge year.\n\nMy post was 91 days ago  and my suggested plays were;\n\nCorteva (CTVA)\n\n$33.82 Now: $44.13\n\nPrecision Bioscience (DTIL)\n\n$6.52 Now: $9.80\n\nCalyxt (CLXT)\n\n$5.07 Now: $4.76\n(offering/dilution occurred soon after, not ideal but has been steadily climbing)\n\nYield 10 Bioscience (YTEN)\n\n$6.49 Now: $7.61\n\nOrigin Argitech (SEED)\n\n$9.63 Now: $16.51\n\n\nI was getting a lot of DMs about the original post so said it would be easier to do an update.\n\nTo answer a few questions, I am still very, very bullish on this sector. I think it is only the beginning.\n\nMy recommendation and largest holding from the above is SEED.\n\nSEED have been working for 10 years to get their GMO right and approved by government, finally they are in and the government is ready to roll out GMO in China. SEED will dominate this space.\n\nIt has had a huge run so far but there are way more catalysts ahead and with a 3 million share float, this going to go parabolic soon. Shorts covering the higher it inevitably goes, think GameStop, Nio, XPEV type of runs , the ones that just look outrageous on your watch list.\n\nRead more about the opportunity for SEED here\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321851/000110465920094375/tm2027521d1_ex99-1.htm\n\nSEED turned down $24 a share in 2014.\nThe CFO commented “I tell people the value of this company is Monsanto multiplied by Baidu divided by Google,” Talk about being bullish and keeping the faith. He was right.\n\nAgain, before commenting mindless comments, “BUY PLTR” “PUMP IT” , just read the original post where I dived deep or do a quick google on GMO or the stocks above.\n\n\nThere are a lot of newbies, so many pump and dumpers but genuine, informative posts about companies still exist on here. I still love this sub!\n\nI’m a long term investor so I’m not to bothered by short term volatility. SEEDs all time high was around $170 15 years ago. In a few months, SEED can be up at 30-40 and I think in a year , it can be at $100, no problem.\n\nHope you enjoyed and hope everyone has a great year investing!",
