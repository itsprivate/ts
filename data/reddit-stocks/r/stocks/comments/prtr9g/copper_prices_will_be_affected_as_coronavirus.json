It affected a lot of industries, and especially a great number of economic activities, which includes mining.\n\nBut for Chile, which is the top copper-producing nation, it seemed like the country’s mining industry is not deterred at all. Copper production by mining companies in the country make up 28 percent of global output. The mineral accounts for 10-15 percent of the South American country's GDP, with much of it exported to China, the world's biggest consumer.\n\nEven though the copper production is expected to go down from 5.7 million tonnes to 5.4 million tonnes this year, the mining sector is still pushing through the crisis with minimal issues. Despite the health panic, mining is not affected much and companies are still continuously producing and going on with their activities.\n\nIn fact, it is not the pandemic, but labor tensions are actually the main factors why there was almost a problem with the copper supply coming from the country. Codelco had to face and end a strike with their plant workers, while BHP Group accepted had a new wage proposal for their union members. Right now Codelco and BHP managed to ease the labor tensions so there is no risks or issues when it comes to the copper supply. \n\nJunior companies are also showing promise with their mines located in the mineral-rich country and is also contributing to the production of the mineral in the nation. Marimaca Copper Corp. for example, released the results of their reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling completed at the Mercedes Target, which has intersected significant oxide copper mineralization from surface. \n\nThree Valley Copper, which has mines in Chile, just announced their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. Despite these being smaller players in the mining scene in the country, both are to show great potential and are still relevant contributors in copper production once they start producing.\n\nWith the recent gain of copper as Shanghai stocks fell 10.7% and the eased tension between workers and mining companies, I believe that copper prices will definitely rally and get affected by all these circumstances. Concerns about the supply faded, global stimulus measures are keeping the demand for it stronger, and with the coronavirus restriction slowly getting lifted up, I think we can all expect more production from the top copper-producing country in the world.",
