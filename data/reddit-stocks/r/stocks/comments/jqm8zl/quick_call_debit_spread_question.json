  "selftext": "So I have been trading option calls and sometimes puts for a couple years now but I haven’t ventured into the different types of spreads and combination/strategies but I have been trying to start to learn a little more now after reading about Call Debit Spreads and how they can (from what I understand) offset some of the cost with higher priced options while also minimizing the time decay.\n\n\nIf I’m understanding the strategy correct I would:\n- Buy an ABC call option. (same expirations)\n- Sell an ABC call option at a higher strike price. \n\n\nMy question is, since the only reason I am able to sell the ABC call without actually owning 100 shares, is because I have the option but this is the part I’m not familiar with and would really appreciate some help...I’ve never sold calls or puts but could the person I sold them to exercise/sell them at any point (just like I would be able to do with any call I purchase) and if so would that automatically force the call I own to be sold as well?\n\n\nTL;DR \nIf I enter into a call debit spread what happens if the person that I sold the call to exercise/sell it whenever they want? And how does that effect me? Would my call also automatically me sold?  \n\n\nHopefully this makes sense, any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
