But the most obvious red flag is the company from which they mention buying the mining rigs from, you can find the news about at their website (https://service.sosyun.com/portalenglish/page/news_list_210121.html).\n\nThe company name is \"HY International Group New York Inc \" (mentioned in above link). If you do a quick search for this company via google, you'll find their website (http://www.hyfth.com/). The website claims to be \"The world's largest mining machine matchmaker\". Thats a bold claim when their website was created literally last week... that's right, LAST WEEK. You can look this up yourself with the following site (https://websiteage.org/).\n\nThe mining website was basically created 2 weeks after the announcement from SOS, that pretty much says it all. What I think happened is that they released the mining purchase news, then noticed how their stock was gaining traction. To make it all seem legit, they create a fake mining website.\n\nIf you compare the SOS site and the mining site, they basically have the exact same layout, even tho the mining site is supposed to be US based. They have literally cloned their website and put some mining rigs on the front page to make it seem legit. The \"contact us\" tab has a fake name (Claire Low), they added a fake phone number and a fake chineese adress just today, they even have an adress that points to trump tower ( 40 Wall St, FL2808 NewYork, NY 10005 ), great effort. Their whole news tab has articles that go back all the way to february 6th 2020, how is this even possible if the website was created last week.\n\nThere are alot of other red flags the company signals, but i feel like this part is enough for people to feel confident about this being a scam. Get out asap.\n\n**TLDR SOS releases news about buying mining rigs from a company ( HY International Group New York Inc. ) that doesn't exist, the stock gains traction during the coming weeks and shoots up in price. They notice this and create a fake website connected to the mining company they mentioned (http://www.hyfth.com/).
