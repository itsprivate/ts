You think you're staying on top of things by reading the posts end-to-end and finding opportunities that really make sense. You get really excited about opportunities with awesome DD but for one glaring issue....timing.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that this DD you found is only likely to get up-voted and become visible to you, after the stock has ALREADY popped. When the stock pops people get excited and they share it out...but it's always coming AFTER the pop. \n\nSo, if your objective is to make a quick profit, you're setting yourself up for failure. Sure, you might get lucky, and you might still make a profit long-term, but your timing in the short-term will always be sub-optimal.\n\nNow...I'm not knocking good DD as a way to find opportunities, but you should update your thinking and maybe taking the following steps instead of buying willy-nilly:\n\n1. After you see some sexy DD, check if the stock is already spiking\n2. If the stock is already spiking...then WATCH it...don't BUY it\n3. Wait for a short-term dip and buy then if you are still bullish \n4. Plan to hold for medium - long term...don't hope for a big short-term gain",
