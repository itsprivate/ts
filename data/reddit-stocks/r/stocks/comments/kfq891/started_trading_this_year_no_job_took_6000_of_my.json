I started trading this year just to see if I could make a little bit of money instead of letting it sit in my savings account and managed to make $35k+ so far in profits off of about $6k of my student loan refund. I'm confused if this fucks me over since I'm in college and have no job. Not sure if I'm getting paranoid for no reason.\n\nTheoretically if I made $100,000+ in profits would I fuck myself over tax wise or with any penalties? Or should I just report what I can on my tax return and move on?\n\nThe stock that I made the most money off is currently projected to do really well and I'm thinking I will make substantially more. I don't want to sell yet but I do want to make sure I don't get in trouble or screw it up. After the success with mine, I later had my boyfriend do the same thing with his stocks and he made $8,000. He's not in college and is employed so we've been paying some attention to his tax bracket and capital gains tax but aren't sure what to do for my situation.\n\nTLDR; In college with no job. Used college loans in stock market and made $35,000 profit. Is there anything special I should do for my tax return? And theoretically if I made $200,000 in profit or $1 million in profit...what would be the next steps?\n\nEdit: I’m 27\n\nUpdate: Ended up securing $20k profits on AMPE. Might buy back some if there’s a big dip. I might post updates on Monday if all goes well? Hopefully...\n\nThank you for all of the advice!",
