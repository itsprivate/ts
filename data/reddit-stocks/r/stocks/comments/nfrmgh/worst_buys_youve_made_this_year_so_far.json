So far, there are only three buys I regret:\n\n3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.\n\n2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.\n\n1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in? My stubbornness refuses to cut this loss, and a balanced portfolio that is gaining more than losing is allowing me to hold this share with the blind belief that it’ll see 800 again.",
