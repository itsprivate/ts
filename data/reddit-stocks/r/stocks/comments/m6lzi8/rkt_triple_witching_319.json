  "selftext": "**Hello friends,**\n\nIn the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.\n\nWell lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.\n\nIn the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.\n\nShort Interest is up:\n\nTodays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**\n\nThe stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.\n\nRKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)\n\n**Shorts still in the game:**\n\nAs of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.\n\nDuring the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').\n\nCheck out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).\n\nSo the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion\n\nIn other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.\n\nAlso remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.\n\nDTCC Rule\n\n**Housing data comes out March 17th:**\n\nThis will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.\n\n1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.\n2. Employment is strengthening.\n3. Economy is re-bounding.\n4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.\n5. Low rates continue.\n\n**Open Call Options:**\n\nLook at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!\n\nRKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.\n\n**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**\n\nStimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.\n\nTriple witching:\n\nIf you did not know about this hang on to your seats\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)\n\nThese Hedge funds are so good at doubling down.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)\n\nRKT Trending on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) :\n\n**Long Term:**\n\nHousing Market on the Move and Mortgage Companies are going to be on Fire!\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers)\n\n[https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster)\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high)\n\n[https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/](https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/)\n\n[https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/](https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/)\n\nThe housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links....
