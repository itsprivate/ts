Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \\[1\\]. Different rules for different players in this game!\n\nBut let’s move back to the whiteboard.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*\n\nToday, I’ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I’ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.\n\nNote: I’m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.\n\n# Long/Short Strategy\n\nIn the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.\n\nIe buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.\n\nThis trade is profitable if Apple’s stock price rises and Gamestop’s (GME) share price decline.\n\nHowever, let say the trade doesn’t go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let’s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.\n\nWhen GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what’s known as an arbitrage trade. I’ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It’s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.\n\n# The High Short Interest Trade\n\nShould Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.\n\nI’ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.\n\nFurthermore, I’ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy\n\nIn this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.\n\nGoing forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it’s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn’t block us in this whiteboarding session.\n\nHere is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \\[2\\]\n\n1. Gamestop (GME)\n2. AMC Networks (AMC)\n3. Dillards (DDS)\n4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)\n5. The Macerich Company (MAC)\n6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)\n\nI’ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \\[3\\]. Ortex data is show in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.\n\n# AMC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 63M\n\nFloat: 102M\n\n% of float shorted 62%\n\n# Dillards (DDS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 4.2M\n\nFloat: 5.5M\n\n% of float shorted: 76%\n\n# Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 58M\n\nFloat: 109M\n\n% of float shorted: 54%\n\n# MAC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 71M\n\nFloat: 113M\n\n% of float shorted: 63%\n\n# SKT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 48M\n\nFloat: 90M\n\n% of float shorted: 53%\n\nAs you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.\n\n# Short Ladder Attack\n\nA common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \\[1\\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren’t valuable when they are.\n\nUsually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It’d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.\n\nThat is why you’ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.\n\nBut you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.\n\n# Short Squeeze Precedent\n\nIn the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.\n\nNever trade more than you’re willing to lose. Diamond hands.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what\\_is\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://ortex.com](http://ortex.com)",
