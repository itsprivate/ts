This may have started as retail vs hedge fund, but by now, it's definitely retail and hedge funds vs hedge funds. There is incredibly smart money, willing to trade emotionlessly with perfect information and bots  in a battle of timing on both sides of this trade. The fact that it closed at $200/share on Thursday means hedge funds with near infinite money were thinking it's probably not worth participating in the short squeeze for more than $200/share. The pros didn't think it was guaranteed money at $200/share and the pros never turn down guaranteed free money. That should bring great caution to anyone still looking to get in. \n\nWhat will likely happen is it will end up selling for large amounts per share for a very short amount of time, and then very rapidly crater in price. Hedge funds on the long side of the trade will be able to execute their sells near perfectly, and retail traders will likely be bag holders after it craters who don't have access to bots for perfectly executed sells. Another very real possibility is there is no pop, remember, the hedge funds didn't buy up all the shares at $200 and just wait for it to climb to $250. They didn't think it was guaranteed to go to $250, which would be well under a pop level.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but I'd exercise great caution before touching this with a 10 foot pole at these prices, and definitely not with any meaningful amount of money. I'd also strongly consider cashing some out if you are already in. Ask yourself how you'd feel if you lost 90% of the current value of your  gme shares, as that's a very reasonably likely outcome for the non-pros, imo.",
