Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.\n\nFrankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. \n\nHowever, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. \n\nSo even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.\n\nIn fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.\n\nSo why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY. \n\nAny other cruise stock holders? I've already started shifting money into a different investment that I have higher conviction will return healthy gains.",
