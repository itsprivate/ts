  "selftext": "So I'm another noob who is lurking the stock subs because of the GME frenzy. It's been really interesting seeing the different takes on what's been going down and what's going to happen next week. r/wallstreetbets has some really great info but also lots of 12 year olds and bots, so it's hard to know what's real or have a real conversation. So I'm hoping yall can help me out and give me your opinions on the following:\n\n1) r/wallstreetbets is convinced that next week GME will rise to at least $1000. I know enough to know thats pretty crazy, but with all the unnatural enthusiasm and attention, plus retail buying was throttled last week. Theres also the short stock percentage, which is being debated on. What are yalls opinions on the likelihood of it reaching $1000? What do you think will be the peak?\n\n2) they're also heavily stoked about AMC. They aren't pretending it's the new GME, but they think it will rise to $50-$100 next week. They think there will be a squeeze plus massive retail buying. There definitely seems to be enthusiasm for it. What do yall think will happen with AMC? And what will it peak be?\n\n3) S3 just came out saying the short stock percentage is a lot lower than last week. r/wallstreetbets doesn't believe the numbers, and honestly they seem to have a decent argument. S3s update contradicted their info from earlier and Friday. Also the amount of shorted stock cleared doesn't seem possible with the amount of volume traded Friday (30m short covered out of 50m). Do you think r/wallstreetbets are kidding themselves? Or do they have a point? Also, call me cynical but I have no problem believing the hedge funds would bribe S3 to give out false information on a Sunday night.\n\nFull disclosure, I bought one GME share just to be part of the fun. I'm not expecting any kind of return and I'm cool with losing it. I'm just interested and would like some honest opinions.",
