And to the rest of the staff team here as well of course! :)\n\nIt has been a pretty interesting past couple of years, especially this year. :P\n\nWell, I won't make this too lengthy of a congrats post like I normally do at some other subreddit communities, but I really just did want to extend a humongous THANK YOU to the entire r/stocks community here. I have been a regular on here (mostly nowadays just posting up those weekend market week ahead threads) and I can tell y'all's first hand that this is one helluva stock Reddit community IMHO.\n\nThe members here are incredibly welcoming, and knowledgeable. And best of all, extremely helpful to all the new arrivals!\n\nTruth be told here, but outside of my own subreddit community, this is indeed my most favorite of all on Reddit!\n\nIt's just a real chill place to hang out, chatting with members who enjoy similar interests, like trading and investing. :)\n\nI'm personally really grateful for this community honestly, cannot stress that enough.\n\nIt's also pretty cool that this milestone is happening so close to the New Year!\n\nAnyway, keep up the great work around here r/stocks community, and to the entire staff team here.\n\nYou guys are a bunch of cool chaps here. ;)\n\nThanks for having me too, have really enjoyed my years here!\n\nCatch y'all's in the new year!\n\nHappy 1 million subscribers r/stocks!!",
