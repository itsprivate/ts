Again, this is high risk, high reward if something similar happens to it like what happened to GME.  The difference is AMC has less short interest.\n\nThanks to the WSB poster who provided this info:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing\\_discussion/comments/l6mpwl/hold\\_your\\_investments/gl21n74?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/l6mpwl/hold_your_investments/gl21n74?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nWhy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet:\n\nTake a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme)\n\nIf you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.\n\nShares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!\n\nAdditionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.",
