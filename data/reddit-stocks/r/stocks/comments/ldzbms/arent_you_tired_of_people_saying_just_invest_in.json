I know that most people are probably just saying it because they don't want anyone to lose money, and it's true that most people will be better off just by investing in the S&P 500. If my mother wanted to invest, I'd probably tell her the same thing, so I get it. But not anyone is like that, and I'd like to see more encouragement in trying stuff, instead of just saying \"just put your money in the S&P 500 and don't even try\".\n\nI'm fairly new to investing, but I get great joy from investing and researching companies. Investing in the S&P 500 would be very boring for me. And I'm also doing very well so far. I don't have a long track record at the moment obviously, since I've been investing for only 2 years. So far, I've always beat the S&P 500 by a long margin . I know 2 years is not much, but hopefully I can continue doing great in the long run.\n\nI also want to be clear about the fact that I don't do day trading or any of this stuff. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to beat the S&P 500 if I did that.\n\nMy tactic is very simple: I buy great stocks and I hold. I never panic sell. And when things go badly and maybe some stocks go down 20%, that's when I buy more, because I still believe in my companies. I've managed to cut out all of the emotions and it served me very well so far.\n\nI know that many people don't beat the S&P 500 in the long run, but it's also true that the statistic is also full of people that do day trading or that simply panic sell every 6 months, right?\n\nSo I'm also curious to hear from people that have invested far longer than me; how's it going for you?\n\nAlso, one more thing: funnily enough, 99% of the people that say to simply invest in the S&P 500, are not even doing it themselves, and they're actually buying lots of individual stocks... and making lots of money. Isn't that ironic?",
