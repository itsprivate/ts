I did that for 1 month and my portfolio, made up of 18 stocks, is **now up +40%**, with some stocks **up +165%**. Here is the portfolio: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IiVUe3LtMWRpEix\\_e5xuDTidy6h\\_iBLcc3\\_bN6OJo2o/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IiVUe3LtMWRpEix_e5xuDTidy6h_iBLcc3_bN6OJo2o/edit#gid=0)\n\nHere's the process I go through to find those stocks - **you'll see it's more complex than just trusting a program blindly:**\n\n* My program is made out of a Python script that scans Reddit (all finance-related subs) and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So weâ€™re not talking about the over discussed meme stocks like TSLA and such. Weâ€™re talking about the next ones.\n* How does it do that? My python script looks for stock tickers and finds out the number of mentions they each generate on Reddit and Twitter. Every ticker that generated a lot of chatter based on a DoD (day-on-day), WoW and MoM analysis will be added to the script's output.\n* Once the list is compiled, I apply a level of human curation by reviewing each stock and determining whether the conversations around those are indicative of potential PnDs, high volatility, pumps without fundamentals etc. If so, I filter them out.\n* Once I have created my own list of stocks I deem \"under-the-radar\" and \"emerging\" - so, again, not your TSLA or NIO - I run my own DDs on each and determine whether they're worth investing in.\n\nSo far I'm really happy with the results. I feel more and more that **a mix of machine-driven data analysis and human curation** is the way to go here, as opposed to simply trusting the program I built - which has sometimes led me to poor investments (hi Hyliion ðŸ˜¬).\n\nWhat do you all think? I'd be really curious to hear your thoughts and any ideas you may have on how to improve such experiment.\n\nWishing you all a great week!",
