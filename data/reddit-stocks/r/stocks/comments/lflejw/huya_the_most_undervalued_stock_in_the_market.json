It sells ads across its platform, but it generates most of its revenue from virtual gifts viewers can buy for their favorite broadcasters. Last quarter, Huya generated 94% of its revenue from its live streaming business, and the remaining 6% from online ads. Remember this last part. \n\nHuya's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 18% year-over-year to 172.9 million last quarter. Within that total, its mobile MAUs grew 16% to 74.2 million, and its total number of paid users increased 13% to 5.3 million.\n\nCEO Rongjie Dong attributed that growth to an increase in e-sports tournaments throughout the shorter summer and its deeper ties with Tencent, the world's largest video game publisher. If Huya closes its planned merger with Douyu next year, its MAUs could more than double to nearly 370 million, with over 13 million paid users.  \n\nPINTEREST has less monthly active users and is worth 50 BILLION!!!!\n\nHuya generates higher profits because it shares a near-duopoly with Douyu, is backed by Tencent's massive video game business, and generates most of its revenue from higher-margin virtual gifts instead of lower-margin digital ads.\n\nWall Street expects Huya's revenue and earnings to rise 40% and 74%, respectively, this year. Next year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 36%, respectively. Based on those estimates, Huya looks incredibly cheap at 19 times forward earnings and just two times next year's sales.\n\nThose forecasts don't account for Huya's potential merger with Douyu, which could easily double its annual revenue. But its valuation should remain roughly the same after the all-stock merger, since it will grant current shareholders of Huya and Douyu equal halves of the new company.\n\nTencent holdings is about to merge DOYU and HUYA into the biggest online gaming streaming service in China (roughly 80%). \n\nI predict tencent (the “kingmaker”) will turn it into an advertisement giant, they will have roughly 370 million active users (think Pinterest at 50B mcap) at a market cap of 10B (post merger). \n\nThis is a HIGHLY shorted stock at 35% of float. It is being manipulated, I believe, because the shorts are having a problem covering with the recent run up (they just filed the merger with the SEC) so an “analyst” gave it a downgrade to help them out today. \n\nThis is a buying opportunity of a lifetime. Huya/DOYU will be a dominate player in the biggest growing sector there is right now (Chinese gaming)... and UNLIKE GameStop, it is a highly profitable business and IS severely undervalued at it’s current price. \n\nI went YOLO with 36,000 shares and will provide updates as it progresses.",
