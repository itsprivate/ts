I just happen to be buying calls cause it seems very undervalued to me, and the calls are cheap. You can 100% buy shares and do well.\n\nI picked up 640 10c for feb 19. They were 5$ each. The stock is at 8.99 as im writing this and up .40$ from yesterdays low. These are cheap as shit. This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or r/options. So im mentioning it there in all 3. \n\nThis is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything, let alone short dated options. You dont have to buy them for this play, im just explaining how undervalued they are. \n\n10c for 3/19 (42 days) are $.20.\n12.5c for 3/19 are $.10\n\n\n\nNow onto the DD for Celestica:\n\nMarket cap:1.15B\nFree float:108m\nAvg Volume :310,000\nInstitutional ownership: 69% üöÄüöÄ\nMany of our good friends such as Citadel are even increasing their positions. \nOther notable institutions: JP morgan, Vanguard, Goldman sachs, and Morgan stanley. Source: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cls/institutional-holdings\n\n\n\n*They have over 24,000 employees, brought in 5.88B revenue in 2019, and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide. Theyve been in business for 27 years. https://www.celestica.com/news/media-information\n\n*Their most recent earnings, released jan 26, 2021, show an earnings of 0.16$ per share, as opposed to a loss of 0.05$ per share last year. This means that they were profitable during covid, and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies. \n\n*They have an ‚Äúundrawn $450M revolver‚Äù as they put it on their site, or $464M in cash. https://corporate.celestica.com/static-files/e9830936-130f-44f6-9f73-3127402c00d5\n\nSo what do they do? Yes.\n\nCelestica Inc.\nCelestica inc. Is a provider of supply chain solutions. The company operates in electronics manufacturing services. The company offers a range of services to its customers, including design and development, engineering services, supply chain management, new product introduction, component sourcing, assembly and testing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, precision machining, order fulfillment, logistics and after-market repair and return services. Its products and services serve a range of applications, including servers, storage systems, optical equipment, aerospace and defense electronics, healthcare products and applications, semiconductor equipment, and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters. It designs, manufactures and tests solar panels for residential, commercial, and utility scale markets.\n\nIm in this for the clean energy, innovative tech, supply chain, and aerospace. Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo.\n\nWe all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy(looking at you ICLN gang), and that its a main focus of many governments around the world. They have 6 locations in China, 2 locations in South Korea, and 3 locations in Japan. These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy. They also have 4 locations in California, and a few other locations throughout the US. Basically, theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation.\n\nI can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs, including the new space one, ARKX.\n\nTheir linkedIn page is full of jobs, they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions. They pay their staff relatively well, (avg 60k per year with 32k/yr being minimum for warehouse staff.) The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of 3.5 stars on Glassdoor and 3.9 on indeed. Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit, which is very promising.\n\nI dont know how to add pictures. üöÄüöÄüöÄ\nThe only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation, there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre-covid. Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call. Before the march crash, the stock peaked at 9.29. At the bottom of the crash, it was trading at 2.63. Since then, they have rebounded back to over 9$ per share and are approaching pre-covid highs. Their 2019 earnings were negative 0.05$ per share, and their earnings for 2020 were $0.16 per share. Again, this means that they went from losing money pre-covid, to being profitable during.\n\nReasons I believe the stock is undervalued:\nVery low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists, or that the company is dogshit. This company is not dogshit. A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B$/year in sales.\n\n$CLS holds a P/E ratio of 8.86, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.83. \n\n$CLS has a P/B ratio of 0.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of \n1.79. This alone makes them very undervalued.\n\n$CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue, or sales. This is a useful metric on low volume/unheard of stocks, because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.31.\n\n* CLS has a P/CF ratio of 5.83. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.35.\n\nPlease let me know if you find more/better information, or if something ive said is incorrect.\n\n\nTldr: $CLS is a tech/clean energy company involved in many promising industries. They are undervalued in every sense of the word, and their options even more so. They have extemely low volume due to being unknown, but are by no means a dogshit penny stock. Stock is currently trading at 9.03, and 10c for 2 weeks out are $.05. Yesterday they opened at 8.73, found resitance at 8.60, and climbed to 8.95 at close. \n\nPositions (again): 640 x CLS 10c 2/19.       ü™ê\n   \n\n\n                                                üöÄ$CLS\n\n\n\n\n      üí•$GME\nüåé",
