It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It’s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.\n\n1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month.
