  "selftext": "PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021\n\nThe selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. \n\nMarket participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”\n\nWhile the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. \n\nMoreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   \n“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\nIn addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla (TSLA) is tweaking its self-driving software to eliminate a phantom braking problem and may release a significantly improved version within the next two to three weeks.\n* Roblox (RBLX) says it would be able to pay its game developers more money if Epic Games - Apple trial results in cut fees in the app-store.\n* Vehicle sales in China rose 8.6% in April versus the same month a year earlier, their 13th consecutive month of gains, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales reached 2.25 million vehicles in April\n* Gartner Research says it expects the global semiconductor shortage to persist until 2022.\n\n“Success is not final, failure is not fata; It is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston Churchill",
