These are things to look at\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Below is my  Guide on HOW TO ANALYZE & RESEARCH A STOCK, and what you should look at when evaluating a stock** (This is my checklist just build from years of wins & losses, things I learned from Pace University and Goldman Sachs).  If I am investing large amounts of cash, I want to research thoroughly, so if the stock drops I can stick to my convictions, and forget about emotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I use my time to research a stock, read up about it into detail, and dig into the financials, news, and 10-K, I check these **two** things first, to decide if I should use my time to dig further:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I quickly look at **price upside**. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets. (Money is a tool, and you want it to work for you). MarketBeat.com can show you this: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-targe](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-target)t/\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I look quickly at the **charts and the technicals**. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? A site you can use to interpret the charts for you is BarChart.com and TradingView.com\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If it passes these two quick tests, then I start to dig deeper.**\n\n**Other things I look at:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. &#x200B;\n2. **Sentiment & News**. I Google the company. I search the ticket on Twitter. What are people saying?  How do they feel? \n3. **Earnings & revenue history.** Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections. Are the making money? Will they make money?\n4. **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. Is there potential?\n5. **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? (Quick ratio, Profit margin, EPS, Income Statement Trend, Cashflow). Can this company survived? Is it managed well?\n6. I dig deeper into **technical analysis and the charts.** I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc. What is the Long term trend? What is the short term trend?\n7. **Valuations**. How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio). Is it over-valued? Is it undervalued? \n8. **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? \n9. **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock to go down?\n10. **Peers & competition**. How does this company stack up against its competitors and peers? How do the financials compare? How to the products compare? Is there a moat?\n11. **Institutional Sponsorship.** Are big banks and wall street holding this? How much or this company's stock do they hold?\n12. **Insider Trading**. Is the CEO buying or selling shares?\n13. The amount of **ETFs** that hold this stock. Will they continue to buy it up and drive price over time?\n14. **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it? (The higher the volume, the thinner the bid/ ask spreads)\n15. **Social sentiment**. I check what people are saying on twitter, reddit, and google search trends. Is it trending?\n16. **News moves a stock.** So I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. Are there potential catalysts that may move the stock? \n17.
