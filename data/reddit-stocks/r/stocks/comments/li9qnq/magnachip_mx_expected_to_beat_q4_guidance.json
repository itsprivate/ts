However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for MX.\n\nHIMX, another company operating in the display panel space (albeit not in OLED), has said that the transition from LCD to OLED screens is happening fast and sees OLED DDIC s as a major opportunity: \"As we have repeatedly indicated, traditional smartphone DDICs are quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED....We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small- and medium-panel driver IC business in 2021.\"\n\nIn fact, HIMX said that given the \"helplessly tight\" semiconductor situation. **\"We can very often transfer the cost increase to customers and a bit more.\"**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -> drastically undervalued at \\~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...\n\nRecommendation: Shares are more attractive given the options are somewhat thinly traded.",
