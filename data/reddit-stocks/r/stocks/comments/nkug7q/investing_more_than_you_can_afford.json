Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. \n\nLike a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a \"rookie\" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:\n\n- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.\n\n- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term\n\n- thinking about your investment as \"money you have\" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. \n\nHere are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:\n\n1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.\n\n2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. \n\n3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.\n\n4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night \n\n5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.\n\n6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say \"assume it's money down the drain,\" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.
