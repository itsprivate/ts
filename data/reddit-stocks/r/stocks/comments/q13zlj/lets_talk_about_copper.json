Right now companies are striving to meet the supply demands but with some setbacks. Just recently both Codelco and BHP were able to pacify labor tensions with one ending a strike with their plant workers, and the other one accepting a wage proposal for their union members. This is an important issue, since these two companies are the top producers of copper and are all located in the top copper-producing nation, Chile.\n\nBecause of this, there is still a lot of speculation if there will be enough copper in the future. Bigger companies are continuously producing and contributing to meet with demands, but there are also a lot of junior companies that are continuously exploring their sites for more of this mineral, with some of them starting their drilling activities, hoping to achieve production in the near future.\n\nJust recently West Mining Corp. (CSE: WEST) (OTC: WESMF) started their 2021 diamond drilling program on the Kena Copper Zone area of its 100% owned Kena gold and copper project in southeastern British Columbia. Three Valley Copper (TVC), on the other hand, just announced their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. They also announced the commencement of their 2021 near mine exploration drilling program on the Minera Tres Valles property near Salamanca, Region de Coquimbo, Chile, from which they own 91.1%.\n\nHowever, just recently, it has been released that copper prices fell on Tuesday due to a debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. Copper for delivery in December fell 0.6% from Monday’s settlement price, touching $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) midday Tuesday on the Comex market in New York.\n\nFrom hitting above US$9,000 per ton in February this year for the first time since September 2011, there are a lot of speculations on whether this price spike is just temporary or will it be a long-term one and copper will be a commodity supercycle. With this happening with China, how will it affect companies? Will prices continue to go down or will it be able to recover and increase even more?",
