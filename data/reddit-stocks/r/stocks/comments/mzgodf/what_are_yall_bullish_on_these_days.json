I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)\n\nAMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it's because I'm old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn't exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.\n\nLam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven't even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. \n\nSnaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I'm honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I've owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn't terrible, wasn't great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I'm not really too attached to this play, it's a small percentage and it's a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I'm a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.\n\nIntel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven't gotten back in it yet.\n\nI'm also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it's so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)\n\nCarbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don't know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it's old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.\n\nOil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. \n\nI like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it's much smaller scale and doesn't really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it's the perfect storm for greener energies.\n\nI went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I'm not bullish on healthcare, but it's a savings account and it's not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low.",
