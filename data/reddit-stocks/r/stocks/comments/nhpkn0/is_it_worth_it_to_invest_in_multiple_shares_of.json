I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing.

I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue chip company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue chip company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think\n\nMy comparison, my portfolio right now is:  \n2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  \n3.02 shares of V (Visa)  \n1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  \n2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  \n(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)\n\nThanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too.
