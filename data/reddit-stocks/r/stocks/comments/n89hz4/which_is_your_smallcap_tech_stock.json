Its an Italian company, a competitor of Twilio but in its infant stage. Its a very undervalued tech play as well: its valuation is only  $380 million, compared to Twilio's massive $52 billion. Why do I pick Kaleyra, instead of Twilio, or any other competitor? It operates as a bridge in the communication process of  App-Cloud-Message-Customer. A simple SMS from your bank app or Uber happens thanks to a company like Kaleyra.  Also provides communications involving chatbots, verification process, voice messages, Whatsapp messages, you name it.   Its a sector that keeps growing more and more and has significant barriers of entry. Here some points: \n\n\\-It has a prices-to-sales ratio of 2, yes, only 2!. \n\n\\-Kaleyra operates mainly in Europe, India, and its gaining ground in the US thanks to a very recent acquisition. It has a lot of know-how in the financial industry.\n\n\\-It is cash-flow positive. \n\n\\-It has among its clients Twilio. Yeah, its main competitor has been its client. Plus other 3500 enterprise customers. \n\n\\-It got its debut last year in Wall Street. With the acquisition of Mgage, its projected to double its revenue in a year or less. The stock price has suffered lately, no bad news whatsoever, just affected by the market in general and shorters: 15% of its stocks are shorted. \n\n\\-Twilio is the absolute leader of this sector, with a better growth rate and better margins. However, a company like Kaleyra, with such a small valuation and great growth prospects, offers a potential multi-bagger possibility in a shorter time. Next earning report is next Monday.\n\nThis is not financial advice. Do your own research. Whats your small-cap tech stock?",
