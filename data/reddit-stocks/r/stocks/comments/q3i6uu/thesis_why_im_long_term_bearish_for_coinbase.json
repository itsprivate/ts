The problem is that fee revenue will slowly decline over time, as more competition comes in that offers less fees steal customers away. A new app called [Strike](https://strike.me/) offers Bitcoin trading at 0 fees (technically not 0, but less than a penny per transaction). Coinbase will eventually need to evolve it's business model to stay competitive with companies like Strike.\n2. **Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation**: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall. For those who are unaware, Coinbase has a VC arm called *Coinbase Ventures*. Basically, Coinbase buys up the supply in these early presales of these worthless tokens no one ever heard of, brings these obscure tokens to market by listing them on their exchange, and then dumps these tokens on retail investors at ridiculous valuations. Regulators will see this morally repugnant behavior and crack down on it.\n3. **Most of the tokens on Coinbase will be retrospectively classified as securities**: Gary Gensler has said that \"Every ICO is a Security\", which makes the majority of tokens listed on the platform securities, including the second largest coin, Ethereum. Classifying them as securities means that Coinbase must legally delist them and will take away 70% of their revenue.\n4. **Bitcoin ETF will steal the majority of volume away:** Grayscale has announced that they are looking to convert *all of* their funds into crypto ETFs, not just Bitcoin. Meaning, you will see every altcoin like Solana, Cardano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc... all have their own ETF. So, at some point, you must ask, what's the point in using Coinbase if all of the coins are going to have their own ETF tickers?",
