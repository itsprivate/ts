He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming \"if he's still in, I'm still in!\" and \"look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold\" are really living up to the dumb ape meme.

You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.\n\nBut even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go \"to the moon,\" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \\~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.",
