TLDR: how do you arrive at a target price?\n\nSo I’m trying to learn how to get better at DD, and I’m hitting a bit of a snag, namely how to calculate the ~~‘fair value’~~ *target price* of a stock. \n\nMost of my analysis in the past has been pretty hand-wavy, e.g. Green Energy = the future, duh, so one stock green energy company please! Most of my bets have paid off handsomely, but the recent downturn in green energy/EVs/ biotech has forced me to question what a “reasonable” share price is for a company. Obviously there’s a bit of a guessing game here, but it seems like one could arrive at a ballpark ~~‘fair’~~ *target* value based on the size of the market, the company’s dominance within that market, and the market’s/company’s growth potentials. Those values, relative to the market cap, should allow for a back-of-the envelope guesstimate of ~~fair~~ *target* stock price. So my question is, is there a relatively straightforward relationship here? \n\nAs a example, here’s [a recent report about the augmented reality market and its growth potential](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market), and here are some values mentioned  in it:\n\n- Market size value in 2021 = USD 26.75 billion\n- Revenue forecast in 2028 = USD 340.16 billion\n- Growth Rate = CAGR of 43.8% (2021 to 2028)\n\nNow let’s say I’m looking at KOPN, which makes wearable AR devices like Google glasses, displays in fighter pilot helmets, and AR-enabled displays for surgeons. They currently have a market cap of $860M, with a share price of ~$10. Is this currently overvalued (has the potential growth already been “priced into” the current share price, as the cool kids like to say), or is it still undervalued and now is a good time to stock up on shares?\n\nAny help is appreciated.",
