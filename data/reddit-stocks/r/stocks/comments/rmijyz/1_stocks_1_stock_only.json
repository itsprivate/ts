If you had $15K to buy one stock and one stock only to buy and hold for the foreseeable future what would it be?\nHere are the details. I have a bit of money and am thinking of throwing it into one stock, and a fun investment. \nI know lots of people will answer the S&amp;P or a total market fund etc. but I already have those. I’m looking for one stock to buy as a big bet and hold onto.\nSo any suggestions? I would also welcome answers from those of you who have some experience, maybe you did this once 10 years ago and know what it’s like to ride the waves over the years.\nAnyways thanks for all the input internet people.",
