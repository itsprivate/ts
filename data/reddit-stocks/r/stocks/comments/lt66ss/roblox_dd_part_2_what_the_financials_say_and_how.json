  "selftext": "Hello again r/stocks. The other day I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrk8uv/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) with my product/customer analysis on Roblox using my thoughts and knowledge having dealt with the platform since its early days. I believe my insight was important as it gave information and understanding about the platform from a perspective that can't be found in any traditional analysis. If you plan to read this post and haven’t read that one already, I encourage you start there. I don't expect any grown adult to engage with the product themselves to do their own DD (unless they play with their kids or something like that).\n\nThe post blew up both here and on the [identical thread in r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/), more than I was expecting them to. A lot of good points and discussion was had, and as such, I feel the need to follow up with some more information. I was able to simply edit the r/investing thread, however, one of the links I edited with on r/stocks was disallowed and the post was deleted. So, here's my part 2 with the information you guys missed from the other thread's edits.\n\nA lot of people asked how I could conclude a large percentage of Roblox's player base is bots that prey on kid's accounts or inactive users.  That is more of an anecdote than something you can back up with hard numbers and data, because it’s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for “free Robux” and such. There’s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it’s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter & number usernames. I took that info, compared the total player base to the active one, and made my conclusion that their security and captcha are lacklustre. Their registered user count of **2.4 billion** is not impressive when compared with the daily active user (DAU) count of around **30 million**.\n\nMoving on to the financial side...\n\n[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:\n\n>***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  \n>  \n>We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2 million, $86.0 million, and $203.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0 million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\nRoblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:\n\n>***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  \n>  \n>We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March 31, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September 30, 2019 to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  \n>  \n>• **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  \n>  \n>• **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  \n>  \n>**• increase global awareness of our brand.**\n\nThe bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:\n\n>***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  \n>  \n>Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.\n\nLargely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.\n\nSo, all that being said, where do we stand currently?\n\n* Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.\n   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?\n   * This information is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)\n* Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.\n   * The link to this is available in the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/)\n* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.\n   * For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2 million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8 million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\n      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.\n\nSo, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.\n\nMoving on...\n\n[This comment chain from the r/investing thread is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for in the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine & platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.\n\nFor Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of \"kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative\", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.\n\nThe game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. There are some images showing what's possible on the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:\n\n>68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nThese kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:\n\n>For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.\n\nA lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns. Furthermore, the most popular games are cash grab \"simulators\" and carbon copies of games that already exist, sometimes with stolen assets. That presents a copyright problem if Roblox is to continue expanding.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading, and best of luck in your future investments.\n\n**TL;DR**: No TL;DR. This is not WSB where I feed you positions to take or hype up a stock so we can all win/lose money. Read my post, do your own research, and make your own educated decision if Roblox interests you as an investment.",
