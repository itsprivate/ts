It's taking every fiber of strength to not pull out this money too.\n\n* Good thing: staying away from following all the news and pretending I am a genius predictor about which real life news will make a price go up or down.\n\n* Good thing: I still very much enjoy it and would love to continue going this way. I realize for many my strategy is probably a boring conservative one but I am most comfortable with this and I feel it still did quite well for me, mostly thanks to Tesla of course (and who knows where that price will go) but the rest of them went up too still.\n\nedit: formatting/typo",
