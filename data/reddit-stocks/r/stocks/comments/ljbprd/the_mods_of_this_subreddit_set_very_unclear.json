  "selftext": "I recently made a post in this subreddit.\n\nIt was removed by the automoderator.\n\nThe automoderator sent me the following message:\n> Sorry your post was removed in r/stocks because of rule 4: The R****h**d app should be discussed in r/R****h**d . We already whitelisted discussions regarding R****h**d IPO, so message the mods if your post is regarding the IPO & still was removed, if not see below:\n> \n> READ CAREFULLY:\n> If you're making a post and mentioning you use R****h**d , please don't, the app is shilled so much that it's spam, please copy your post and repost without mentioning R****h**d or the app/broker you use.\n> If you're trying to get help with R****h**d , then post to r/R****h**d that includes how to use options or asking why a stock/etf is missing on R****h**d \n> If you're looking for a list of brokers, click here.\n> If this isn't a discussion on R****h**d , please resubmit your post without the word R****h**d .\n> And absolutely no referral links!!! See rule 2!\n> A list of the rules can be found here, and if you're new to r/stocks please see the wiki and/or read this post.\n> \n> I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nSo you know what I did? I followed the instruction in the message that said \"please copy your post and repost without mentioning R****h**d .\"\n\nSo my next post didn't say R****h**d on it in any way shape or form.\n\nIt was also removed by the automoderator. \n\nI got this message: \n> Sorry your post was removed in r/stocks because the title tells me you're new, so we're going to get you setup:\n> \n> See our wiki which has virtually everything on stock picking\n> If instead you just want the fast route to investing, see here.\n> A list of brokers here.\n> Need to practice?\n> Book recommendations\n> Websites that'll help you get better or get stock info.\n> Did you need a trading system? Try uptrends or look for buy signals.; here's 4 methods of Trend Trading.\n> Make sure you know our sub reddit rules here and read our sticky posts like this one.\n> \n> Finally after reading the wiki if you have specific questions, or want to share what you learned/gained/lost, feel free to post them at r/stocks, just make sure not to put in the title \"noob, newbie, newcomer, or beginner.\" Thanks.\n\nOkay, sure. Fair enough. I wanted to **share what I learned** which was CLEARLY encouraged in the message from the automoderator.\n\nSo I modified my post A THIRD TIME. This time, it didn't get automatically removed. It had a score of 21 and had received a wholesome award by the time it was removed. Along with my removal, I got a THREE DAY BAN and this message from the mod team:\n\n> You have been temporarily banned from participating in r/stocks. This ban will last for 3 days. You can still view and subscribe to r/stocks, but you won't be able to post or comment.\n> \n> Note from the moderators:\n> \n> Stop making new posts we have had 100+ lessons learned GME posts in the last few days. Use the Stickied threads or existing GME threads.\n> \n> If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/stocks by replying to this message.\n\nAt this point, I felt like I hadn't violated any rules, especially to an extent that deserved a ban. The reason they gave me for my ban is to \"stop making Ga me st op posts.\" Well... that's not in the rules, is it?\n\nSo I reached out to the mod team and said:\n>A ban without a warning is pretty uncool. More people seemed to like my post than dislike it.\n\n>Probably won't be returning to this subreddit since I feel so unwelcomed.\n\nAnd they sent me this message:\n> Automoderator did warn you, twice. Generally we perma ban for this, but the other mod gave you a 3 day temp ban with only 2 more days to go, so you're over reacting.\n> \n> Next time read the automod messages that are sent you to.\n\nSo that's my whole story here. Citizens of /r/stocks, you tell me. Was my ban deserved? Or was the mod team out of line?",
