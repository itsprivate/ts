In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself.

Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. \n\n\nIt's not the $3000 (net) that's bothering me, it's just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don't even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think. \n\nAny advice, any suggestion, any smack in the head, reality check would be appreciated. Sorry for the rant.
