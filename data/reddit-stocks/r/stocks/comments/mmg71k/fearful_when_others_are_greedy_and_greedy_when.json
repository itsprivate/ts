Many of these we talk about quite often in this sub. \n\nLooking at companies like $BABA, $TME, $BIDU, $JD and $IQ, most of them have fallen anywhere from 15-48%. Recent news has mentioned that the hedge funds and banks are letting go of their Chinese holdings but I believe this is a great buying opportunity strictly due to the low prices and Munger's new position. \n\nMost of them still have pretty high analyst PT's but their P/E's and P/S's stick out like a sour thumb. All of these companies are stuck below the 42 zone on the RSi and show massive growth for the EPS. Being able to pay off any debts and having Jack Ma, the idiot who spoke against a communist government finally out from CEO of BABA, may now let us see the only upside potential we've been waiting for. BTW, hearing Munger's opinion on Jack Ma's actions and him stepping down seriously makes me believe BABA is a gold mine with purchasing LEAPS. Much more of a safer bet with him out of the eqaution. \n\nI still have a great interest in these companies and want to hear some of your opinions on this. I did purchase today 600 shares of $IQ @ 18.54 to add a new stock into my portfolio with me already having LEAPS on BABA and a decent amount of money in JD @ 84 per share. Even though the hedge funds and banks are dumping their stakes, I believe it has the potential to make solid, big gains. ",
