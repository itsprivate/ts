Tech, communication services beat the tape (FANMAG complex broadly higher). Consumer staples, healthcare, utilities the only sectors lower. Treasuries mostly firmer with some notable strength at the long end of the curve. Dollar weaker on the major crosses. Gold finished up 0.7%. WTI crude settled up 3.9% despite OPEC and its allies agreeing increase output by \\~2M bpd through July.\n   * **Infrastructure continued to dominate the headlines with a lot of moving pieces** after White House detailed plans to spend $2.25T+ over next eight years. Fiscal stimulus still a key piece of the bullish narrative for stocks though plans for another big spending also fit with pickup in concerns about inflation/economic overheating. Higher taxes another potential headwind for risk sentiment. Also some focus on how difficult it will be to get infrastructure stimulus passed given the lack of Republican support, competing preferences among Democrats and their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate.\n   * Busy on the data front ahead of nonfarm payrolls tomorrow. **ISM manufacturing gauge surged in March** with new orders strong, though growing backlogs and supplier delivery times reinforcing broader themes of supply chain pressures and rising input costs.

While this week's claims will not flow through to tomorrow's March jobs report (2-Apr, 8:30 ET), labor market data in focus given reopening and vaccine-driven economic momentum. **March nonfarm payrolls** expected to increase by 285K m/m to 614K, which would be the highest since Oct-20.\n   * **OPEC+ agrees to gradual output increases of 1M bpd over the coming months:**\n      * [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/opec-agrees-to-gradually-increase-oil-output-in-coming-months?srnd=premium&sref=J9GPLx1B) reported that OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually boost oil output from May to July.
