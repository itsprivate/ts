What's up with that?\n\nThey all speak down to the public as if we're all a bunch of simpleton, peasants, or stupid children.  They keep parroting the same message in condescending tones that slow and steady investments are the way.  Do the 401K.  Do the ETF.  You're not going to get rich quick (or at all).  As if they became billionaires with slow and steady and honest work vs. all the other ways they've captured most of our assets and resources, and exploited the working class.  That point isn't arguable.  The numbers don't lie.  If you're pulling in billions, capturing and retaining all the wealth this nation is creating, you're getting far far more than your fair share and the consequences are spreading like wildfire.  Anyhow, over and over this past week with almost feverish effort, they are condemning the savvy youth of today who are spreading and sharing their research and knowledge on economics, businesses, and investing.\n\nSure, there are jokesters and a handful of fools who boast their losses and blather silliness about meme stocks.  We joke along, but this is serious business, and we're not simpletons or children.  You can't make an honest living, slow and steady, and earn enough with work alone these days to realistically satisfy all of your responsibilities and ease into your twilight years.  You MUST, absolutely MUST learn how the game is rigged, and play the same tactics as all those who are telling us to go back to exploitive fund managers and retirement plans.  Yes.  Do that, but do not trust that your retirement plan administrators are going to forego their multimillion dollar lifestyles in order to give you a fair return on your savings and investments.  Take charge yourself.  Do your research.\n\nFinally, find a new game to play, if you find it's become too corrupted. There are sharks out there, and they've commandeered our money, our resources, and our media. I say ignore their propaganda.",
