I assume at least a few of these are lying/manipulating, but a good number of them are legit. Here is a fact: many of these people are going to lose a lot of money, money that they often can not afford to lose. I was that person in the past. It is a terrible, terrible feeling. A feeling I never want anyone to have.\n\nOn one hand, I love seeing the hedge fund guys taken down and pretty much hope they all get taken down. I think most of them are dubious and/or bad people. On the other hand, I see that a bunch of young and inexperienced investors--often not wealthy investors--are risking too much of their net worth on a highly speculative, frenzied bubble.\n\nJUST WHILE WRITING THIS the stock has gone down $50. In just a few mins! Yes, I know it could jump back up again. Folks, this is crazy. Please do not invest any money you can't afford to lose. This is pure gambling at this point, no different than a roulette wheel. Similar to a roulette wheel, you should never gamble more money than you can easily afford to lose for fun. Please be careful folks, I hate to see young/inexperienced people get hurt because they got caught up in something emotional and fun.\n\nAnd speaking of the roulette wheel, you can take $100 and put it on 32 red right now at a casino. If it comes in you will have thousands of dollars. It's just that easy folks! Making money via gambling is just that easy. You don't even need the stock market.\n\nBe careful and safe out there everyone. Sincerely, your mom.\n\nDisclosure: I have absolutely no dog in this fight either way, financially speaking anyway. I own no options or securities related to this discussion in any way.\n\nEDIT: My main point is about people (esp. young/inexperienced people) putting \\*everything\\* into this thing (or any other investment). My main point is not \"no one should buy GME.\" Please understand this difference.\n\nEDIT #2: some of you have flattered with me with comments/questions suggesting that I am an expert. I am no such thing, certainly not about stocks. I am only someone who has a bit of experience/age built up. I am not an expert on stock investing. I am an expert on blowing money as a young person. I blew money on bad investments. I blew money on material possessions that in retrospect are worthless. I blew money on addiction-related things such as drugs and gambling. You can ask me about that. Short answer: it was terrible and felt horrible then and now. Being an irresponsible, reckless young person sucks and I hope no one has to go through it while at the same time I recognize that \\*some\\* people will always go through this as long as there are human beings.",
