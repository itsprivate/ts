Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.\n   * **Cloudflare - $NET**\n      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare\n   * **BlackBerry - $BB**\n      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html).\n      * They also work on QNX.

UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts\n      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.\n      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg).

It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.\n      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware\n      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products.
