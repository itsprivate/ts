It can easily take hold of your emotions and cause you to make some pretty irrational choices. My advice to all of you during green days like this is the following:\n\n* Look at your investments and see if anything has changed. If nothing has changed fundamentally, then it would make no sense to sell now.\n* Look at your portfolio and see if you are heavy in any particular sector.. Readjust as necessary based on your risk tolerance.\n* Lastly, don't look at the graphs all day. I know it is hard for me when I see green everywhere in my portfolio to not question my investing choices. However, it will only do you harm to keep looking at them all day. If your DD on a company has not changed and the price change is due to market volatility, then you have nothing to worry about for today.\n\nRemember there will be green days like today, but there will also be red days in the future as well. Take days like today to step away for a bit.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nP.S. (hopefully this was obvious /s. Just replace \"green\" with \"red\" and \"up\" with \"down\" and it just about sums up a normal post that is made on red days)",
