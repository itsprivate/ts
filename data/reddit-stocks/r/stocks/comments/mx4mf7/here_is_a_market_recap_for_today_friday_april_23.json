  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.\n\nYesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. \n\nHowever, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.\"\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report blew past analyst expectations for the second straight, signaling improving conditions in the labor market and corroborating the pick-up in economic activity as the economy reopens. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended April** **17:** 547,000 vs. 610,000 expected and below last week's total of 576,000\n* **Continuing claims, week ended April 3:** 3.674 million vs. 3.650 million expected and below last week’s total of 3.708 million \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Kathy Entwistle, managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), “we’re going to have our own form of the Roaring Twenties.” [(Full quote here)](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-economy-own-form-roaring-183205436.html)\n* According to the[ Department of Commerce](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf), new home sales surged 20.7% in March compared to February, well above the  14.2% expected for the highest monthly surge since 2006.\n* The U.S. manufacturing sector's preliminary purchasing managers' index for April rose to 60.6, from 59.1 in March,[ IHS Markit reported Friday.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/u-s-business-output-expands-most-on-record-ihs-markit-says) This marked the highest level since the firm began tracking the metric. \n* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. \"These autos are coming.
