Do we the people want to allow movie theaters to become a thing of the past? I don't. And with a Democratic Spirit, I will vote with my money for a future I'd like to see.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Of course, this strategy, of creating value vs finding value, is not for every investor.
