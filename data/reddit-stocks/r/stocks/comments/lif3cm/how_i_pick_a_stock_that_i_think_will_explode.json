Here are some questions I commonly ask:\n\n**Market** \n\n* What market does this company play in? \n* Do I understand this market? \n* If there are multiple, what is its focus, where is its R&D spend, what keeps their lights on? \n* What is the size of the market?  Is it growing? \n* What's going on with this market?  Is it in the news?  Is it legacy or the future? \n* What are the challenges of the market? \n* Are there economic cycles?\n\n**Competitors** \n\n* Who are the competitors? \n* What are their products, their competitive advantage (or lack thereof), their management (see below), and their reputation? \n* Where do they compete? \n* Do they have a Moat? \n* Are they growing or retracting? \n* Know their financials (see below)\n\n**Company** \n\n* What do they do? \n* Know their financials, are they making money?  YOY/QOQ growth, eps, market cap, NI, debt, cash flow, etc..  Know ALL the fundamentals.  \n* How do they compare to their competitors?\n* Who is the management team?  Where have they been?  What is their vision? Are they buying/selling stock. Read their letters and anything they've released to shareholders.  Listen to their earning calls, watch them in the media, google them! \n* Are their employees happy?  Check out Glassdoor, LinkedIn.  They can be candid and you can learn a lot about the company from what they're saying. \n* How is the company perceived?  In the media, by their competitors, by analysts, etc. \n* Do they have a Moat?\n\n**Product** \n\n* What does to company make?
