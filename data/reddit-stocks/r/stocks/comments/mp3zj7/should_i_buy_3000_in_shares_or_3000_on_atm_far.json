Would it be a good idea to buy a close to the money/itm call on the stock, and essentially hold 100 shares up until a certain date, then roll forward if still bullish, or should I buy shares? The stock carries a 2% dividend, but I think I think I would get more benefit from a far dated call, but (obviously) less stability. Thoughts?",
