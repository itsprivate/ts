I should disclose that this is using the year data ending 3/31/20 for HMC (I know, a bit old, but you'll see why it doesn't really matter):\n\nCurrent Market Price: $29.17\n\nBook Value per Share: $43.19\n\nPE Ratio: 5.04\n\nMarket Value divided by Book Value: 0.68\n\n2020 Estimated Shipped Cars: 4.5M\n\nGross Profit: $29.1B\n\nLet's just stop for a second after those figures. The one metric that is truly astounding is HMC is trading *below* it's book value. Honda is one of the largest automotive and motorcycle manufacturers in the world, aside from other products, and yet it trades below its book value. Call me crazy, but even if all it did was reach its book value, you would see a 48% upside. That's already good enough for me.\n\nNow let's talk PE ratio. The current S&P500 PE ratio is right around 40, give or take a bit on when you calculate it out. That's definitely high compared to historical numbers, and there are a whole host of reasons for that that I won't get into. The average S&P500 PE ratio for the past twenty years is 24.9, and its just above 20.1 for the past ten years. With that in mind, HMC's PE ratio of 5 is laughably low. Even if it gets to the S&P500 ten year average PE ratio, which wouldn't even be high by any standard, you're looking at a 298% increase in share price.\n\nAlright, so we're already looking at easy upside from those two metrics, let's slap on another one for good measure - market value/book value. As I mentioned before, you're looking at a 48% upside if the stock price just gets to it's book value. Here's the thing - many stocks these days, including HMC's competitors trade well above their book value. Toyota, for instance, trades at about a 2.6 market/book ratio. If Honda did that, it's share price would be $112.65 right now. Honestly, that seems far more reasonable than where it's at now.\n\nSo, even with just those few metrics, it seems clear that Honda is massively undervalued, but it's fun to compare it to the all-scary monster of a stock, TSLA. Take a look at those same metrics and figures again:\n\nCurrent Market Price: $29.17 vs TSLA at $798.15\n\nBook Value per Share: $43.19 vs TSLA at $24.04\n\nPE Ratio: 5.04 vs TSLA at 1246.88\n\nMarket Value divided by Book Value: 0.68 vs. TSLA at 33.19\n\n2020 Shipped Cars: 4.5M (est) vs. TSLA at 500k\n\nGross Profit: $29.1B vs. TSLA at $6.6B\n\nThat's right, HMC has a higher book value than TSLA, and not by some measly margin. TSLA's astounding PE ratio is just outright scary, and that's the type of information that makes Michael Burry's short of TSLA not so crazy, even if he does have a price target of $100 (nearly a 90% loss). That doesn't stop me from having TSLA shares though, which brings me to my next point.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to mean more than anything right now, and HMC has none. It only takes a quick look at trade volume in the last 6 weeks to see that:\n\nTSLA: 925M vs. HMC: 20.2M\n\nMy view on sentiment is that it has a lot of power, and sentiment generally sticks for companies that are going places. In my mind it's partly what drove AMZN and TSLA share prices to such insane levels, and not to mention GME. If you look at the 5-year chart for HMC you don't see much sentiment at all. HMC is a safe haven, and seemingly forever a stock that you could sell Iron Condors on just picking up cash. That could all change if people start to catch on that HMC is primed and ready to do *whatever the f it wants* with the $25B it has in cash.\n\nSo, here's where I stand. Getting to $43 (book value) would be a correction. Getting to $108 would make it on par with market and similar to Toyota, which I could also view as a correction. If it catches investor sentiment, well, buckle up.\n\n**TL;DR: HMC is massively undervalued by any metric. Upside of at least 50%-300% is more than reasonable, it would be a correction. Comparing it to TSLA is hilarious. Solid financials priming it ready to make moves and catch investor sentiment.**\n\nPositions: 150 shares HMC, 4 shares TSLA. Not financial advice, just providing my own personal view to get some feedback.",
