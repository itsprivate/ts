Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. \n\nIn Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME).
