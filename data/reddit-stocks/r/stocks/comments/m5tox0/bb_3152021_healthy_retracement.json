If you missed it, here's the link on r/stocks  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb\\_this\\_weeks\\_recap\\_3122021\\_technical\\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/)  \n\n\nThis is a healthy retracement, we were not respecting the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour and hourly chart, and were in the overbought territory on the RSI. Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  \n\n\nAlthough I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    \n\n\nAverage volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I'm more into the long game and swing trading ain't really my jam.\n\nContinue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   \n\n\nFrom all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.  \nFrom a fundamentalist's view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.  \nFrom a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  \n\n\nThink of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you'll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   \n\n\nTake care.",
