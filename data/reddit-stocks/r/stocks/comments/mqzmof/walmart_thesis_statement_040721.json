I've been writing my own thesis statements for investments > $10,000 for the last few years.  My last successful venture was $DIS and I also shared my thesis statement here around two years ago.  Full disclosure, I've purchased 80 shares as of this morning.  Writeup was completed as of 04/07/21 and I will send my analyses via excel to anyone interested.\n\n**Walmart Thesis Statement:**\n\nWalmart Corp. is growing its eCommerce presence and maintains a dominant position in the retail industry. Walmart is able to differentiate from its competitors due to the niche market of affordable products in a brick and mortar format that is augmented by its growing online presence. Walmart maintains the highest revenue amongst its competitors (listed below) and is currently relatively undervalued due to short-term financial statements which show a negative net income growth which can be directly attributed to investments in online growth. Assuming a rational market, Walmart is undervalued relative to its direct competitors. It maintains its market capitalization as a retail corporation which will reap the benefits of a growing online economy.  In this paper, a justification for a Market Capitalization of $500B will be made with supporting fundamental and competitor analyses.\n\n**Background Information:**\n\nPrice as of Wednesday, 04/07/21: $140.16\n\nDirect Competitors: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kmart, Kroger, ALDI, Walgreens, Tesco, Carrefour, Best Buy\n\nMarket Capitalization: $394.78B\n\nP/E Ratio: 29.53 (Growth Mode)\n\nDiv. Yield: 1.57%\n\n52-wk high: $153.66 (9.63% Upside) approx. December 1st 2020\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nAs of Wednesday, 04/07, Walmart is the lowest risk retail conglomerate and is priced at a multiple less than its direct competitors including Target and Walmart. Walmart is currently in the midst of a transition to eCommerce which has not yet been sufficiently reflected in its Market Capitalization.\n\n**Competitor Analysis:**\n\n[**https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp**](https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA conservative P/E ratio of 40 would bring Walmart in line with its three top competitors. This computes a 36% P/E ratio increase. This P/E would result in an increased EPS of $9.87/share; in line with Costco and slightly higher than Target. Adjusted Market Capitalization to offset this P/E increase can conservatively be estimated at 25%. A fair valuation for Walmart can then be computed at a Market Capitalization of $500B. Translated to cost per share, a sell price of $176.93 can be computed.\n\n**Debrief:**\n\nIn the coming year, the most important metrics to watch in Walmart’s financial statements will continue to be Revenue, and P/E Ratio. Also important is Walmart’s net income which will be the star of the show as a turnaround in this financial datum will likely result in an increased price per share.",
