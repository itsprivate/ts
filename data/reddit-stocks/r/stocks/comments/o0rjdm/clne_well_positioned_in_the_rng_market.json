I posted some details below, but there is much much more.  I would love to chat with any and all that have any questions or input.\n\nA little basis on Clean Energy Fuels.  The company currently owns 570 fueling stations across the United States and Canada.  They specialize in high grade clean burning Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). They get their fuel by capturing methane released from dairies and landfills.  This fuel is actually carbon negative which positions the company well with the government having entered back into the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nClean Energy Fuels is in a couple of joint ventures with some big oil names you might recognize (Total and BP).  Along with that the company has signed many fueling contracts with waste companies, cities, Port of Los Angeles, LA Metro, UPS, USPS,and many other trucking companies.  On top of that they have recently added a contract with Amazon which recently ordered a fleet of 700 CNG trucks.\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 14, 2021-- The demand for low- and negative-carbon renewable fuel has increased as more companies look for solutions to address climate change. As the leading provider of renewable natural gas (RNG) for the transportation industry, Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ: CLNE) is now well-positioned to turn their customers’ sustainability goals into reality.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210614005069/en/\n\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nToday at its annual shareholders meeting, Clean Energy introduced a new company logo, a cornerstone of an entirely new brand identity that aligns with its growing commitment to expand its renewable fuel solution. This includes investing in the development of RNG from dairies and other agricultural facilities both independently and with partners TotalEnergies and bp.\n\n“Clean Energy’s business has pivoted to focus on an extraordinary renewable, non-fossil fuel that can actually reduce fleets' carbon footprint by as much as 500%,” said Andrew J. Littlefair, president and CEO, Clean Energy. “The logo, color scheme, messaging, website and other brand elements that we introduced today denote a circular economy, where organic waste is turned into sustainable fuel, and embodies the role Clean Energy plays in helping our planet.”\n\nCurrently, RNG represents 70 percent of the fuel sold at Clean Energy’s nationwide network of stations, and the company is on a track to provide the fuel at all its stations by 2025, meeting one of its own sustainability goals.\n\nAs part of the new branding, Clean Energy also launched a new website with updated information about the company’s focus on being able to provide beginning-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand for RNG.",
