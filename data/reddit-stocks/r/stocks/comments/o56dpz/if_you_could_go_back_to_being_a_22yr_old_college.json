Would you put it all into an index fund or buy some individual stocks, or both? Would you invest it all at once or contribute the 50K over time? Thanks in advance, I appreciate any and all feedback.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, this is not a “back to the future” scenario where you just pick the best performer over the past decade.
