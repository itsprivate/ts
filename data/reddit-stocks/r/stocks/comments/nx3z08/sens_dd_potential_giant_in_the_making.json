Market cap 195bn... Bad comp cuz abbot does a lot of other things. \n\nDexcom is the closest comp, they have a *edit 10 day continuous monitor as their main product.\nMarket cap for dexcom is 37.9 bn. Stock price is currently 398$ \n\nPre approval (3/28/2018) dexcom traded at 74.16\nWithin a year it was at 119$ \nIn 2020 it was 262.96 on that day\nThis year it was at 352.73$ on march 26th.... Growth was massive once adoption started. \n\n\nSENS is currently trading at 3.78$. with a market cap at 1bn... \n\nSENS has an arguably superior product than either of it's 2 main competitors. It will gain FDA approval this year most likely (covid delayed it's schedule). \n\n180 day implantable is huge from a patient and doctor burden standpoint. Also, it fits well with medicare's appointment mandate schedule. The product is going to crush the market space it is entering. \n\nI don't think it's a short squeeze play, but it does have 25% short interest, which could be interesting if it starts to gain more traction pre approval. FDA approval date could trap anyone left shorting it still\n\nI think, as a lotto ticket in this casino it could have massive upside, with very minimal downside. Even if adoption is slow or low, it's priced so low it should be near a floor. Even if it eats up a quarter of it's competitors market cap (which it should since it's product is better), it a 10x gainer..",
