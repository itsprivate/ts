Sure, you now owed a copy to the library and they were charging you late fees; but you just made $50 and eventually you'd pick up a used copy for $5 once the hype died down and you'd finish miles ahead.

Now imagine that happening on a massive scale, creating tons of demand with limited supply. That is what is happening with GME. The short sellers haven't returned their library books yet and they are paying more and more late fees while they wait for the price of replacement books to come back down.

This will cause more demand, increasing the price of the books, creating even more urgency for degenerate borrows to cut their losses and move on.\n\nEven better, the borrowers are currently committed to returning more books that are actually available to be bought at any price and the publisher is not printing any more.\n\nThat is why holding the stock makes sense.",
