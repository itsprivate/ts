In addition to the raw numbers, I've also combed through the earnings call transcript to pick out some interesting tidbits that don't necessarily get reported.\n\nAll in all the numbers were absolutely fantastic:\n\n* Quarterly revenue up 78% YoY to $485M, beating the $474M forecast\n* Adjusted EPS 11 cents vs 7 cents forecast\n* Monthly active users up 30% to 478M with strong growth in the under 25 age demographic\n* ARPU $1.04 vs $0.99 forecast\n* Guiding for Q2 revenue growth of 105% YoY,  better than the 95% analyst expectations\n* Product searches grew 20x YoY, indicating significant growth in people using the platform for shopping and not just for search\n* 200% growth YoY in Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces, also demonstrating significant growth in the e-commerce side of the platform\n* Shopify integration expanded to 27 additional countries\n* Seeing good uptake on Story Pins, which functions differently than stories on Instagram. Story Pins allows users to show someone how to do something from beginning to end, such as cook a recipe or renovate a bathroom.\n* International business grew 170% YoY and now comprises 20% of total revenue\n\nSo why is the stock off so much given such fantastic numbers?  Because of one single item: Monthly active users of 478M fell short of expectations for 480M, largely because growth in the US was flat.  Here's what the company said:\n\n\"As pandemic lockdowns were eased in some parts of the world during mid-March, we began to see signs of less engagement and user growth on Pinterest, and we assume this means people are spending more time off-line. While it's impossible to say how people act as we enter the summer months, we anticipate this trend will continue.\"\n\n**My thoughts**\n\nShort-term investors are overreacting to the MAU concern by interpreting it as, \"Uh oh, I guess PINS is just another stay-at-home stock. Time to bail.\"  But this is a mistake.  Some amount of pull-forward is totally expected.  If people are stuck at home, they're going to spend more time online.  We also know people spent more time doing things like redecorating and renovating or learning to cook, the kinds of things that drive engagement with Pinterest.  But that doesn't mean we will start to see a decline in usage once COVID is over.  People will react to the end of lockdowns by catching up on all the things they couldn't do before: travel, socialize, gather outside the home, etc.  But eventually life will get back to pre-covid normal and behavior will swing back to a more normal balance.  The same factors that drove usage growth and engagement with Pinterest before covid will continue to drive it in the future.  This is partly because people actually use Pinterest in an active way, they don't just scroll through it as a time-waster when they have nothing else to do.",
