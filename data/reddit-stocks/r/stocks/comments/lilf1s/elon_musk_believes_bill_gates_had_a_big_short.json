Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”\n\nHe added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.\n\nBut then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:\n\n“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”\n\nWe have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.\n\nTesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.\n\nhttps://electrek.co/2021/02/12/elon-musk-believes-bill-gates-big-short-position-on-tesla-tsla-lost-money/",
