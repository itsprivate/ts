International expansion has been a major focus for Netflix in recent years, particularly in markets across Asia-Pacific since 2016.\n\nThe company has pushed mobile-only plans in places like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, offering those subscription plans at below $5 a month. That’s a stark contrast with the kind of premium pricing Netflix has in markets like the United States, where a standard subscription costs about $14.\n\nIn India, for example, users can pay 199 Indian rupees ($2.68) a month to watch Netflix uninterrupted in standard definition on a smartphone or tablet at any one time.

It has developed more than 40 pieces of original content in India, including the Hindi-language drama “Sacred Games” featuring high-profile Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.\n\nRest of Asia\n\nWhile Netflix isn’t available in China, the company has invested significantly to develop local content for the region. It has produced more than 200 original titles, including over 70 Korean live action and anime titles.
