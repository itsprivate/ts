  "selftext": "The Score Media and Gaming is a Toronto based sports media company. If you are in North America, you are probably aware of The Score's sports app, which is the second most used sports app on the continent, behind only ESPN.\n\nThe Score started as a 24 hour sports broadcaster in Canada way back in 1997 (under the name Headline Sports, before rebranding to The Score). Eventually, they sold their broadcasting assets to Rogers Communications for $167M.\n\nIn their time as a sports network, they had developed Canada's most popular multi-sports app, and they kept their digital assets after the sale of the TV channel, and spun them off into a new company. That company (SCR) traded on the TSX Venture exchange until 2020, and then got uplisted to the TSX.\n\n[I am writing about the company now, because as of probably tomorrow, SCR is being uplisted to the Nasdaq.](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1364665634626416645)\n\n**Why Should I Care?**\n\nFor years, The Score has been growing it's presence, in the digital space. [As of late 2019, The Score had 4.3 million users worldwide, with 62% of them in the US, 27% in Canada and 11% in other international markets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_Media_and_Gaming_Inc)\n\nOnce you have a platform that reaches that many people, the question is: how do you cash in on it? Up until recently, the play had been pure advertising, but the long term play had always been much bigger: **Sports Betting**.\n\nThe Score decided to enter the sports betting industry as an operator, commencing in the New Jersey market in late 2019. They started with market share of about 0.45% in Q1 2020, and steadily increased that to 1.3% by Q4 of 2020. Management reported an increase of 500% in total handle in September 2020 vs September 2020, with the trend holding in October.\n\nIn the last 6 months, they have launched in three more markets (Colorado, Indiana and Iowa).\n\nBut, none of this is the exciting part...\n\n**Ok, so what's the exciting part?**\n\nWhile The Score's app is popular in the US, it is omnipresent in it's home market of Canada. The Score is not only the top sports app in Canada, it has about twice the monthly users as the second place sports app (which is TSN...ie. Canada's version of ESPN).\n\nSingle sports betting is still currently illegal in Canada, but Bill C-218 is being fast-tracked to change that. [It passed it's second reading on February 17, 2021 with overwhelming support across all major parties](https://openparliament.ca/bills/43-2/C-218/). Next in the process is committee stage ([which is literally occurring as I write this](https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20210225/-1/34842)), then the final reading and royal assent. There is no guarantee on the speed a bill will pass through Parliament, but with all parties supporting it, the bill could become law within weeks.\n\nBill C-218 would leave it to individual provinces to regulate, with the elephant in the room being Ontario, which has about 35-40% of Canada's population.\n\nIn November of 2020, [the Ford government in Ontario promised legislation which would end the provincial lottery's current monopoly on legal online casino games](https://www.onlinepokerreport.com/45574/ontario-ford-government-promises-online-gambling-legislation/). Sports gambling is expected to be part of this shift as soon as the feds give the ok. With Michigan legalizing single sports betting, and all the tax money currently being lost to off-share operators (part of the justification for the casino game shift), sports betting in Ontario could be open for private operators as early as this year.\n\nAnd, if that happens, SCR becomes an unbelievable play.\n\nThe Score's largest market is it's home market of Ontario. It is based in Toronto. When it was a TV network it's open-window studio at King and John was a local landmark. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that almost every serious sports fan in Ontario already has the Score App on their phone.\n\n[The Score has 1.4M active monthly users in Ontario.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue) For a province with about 14.5M people, that's about 10% of every man, woman and child in the province who uses The Score's app regularly.\n\n[The Ontario sports betting market is estimated to be worth between $1.5B and $2.1B in gross annual revenues](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue).\n\nThe hardest part about growing as a sports betting operator is user acquisition. The Score already has that taken care of. Their target market is already checking sports scores on their app. It's not a big move to get those interested in gambling on those games to also use the same app.\n\nThey have their app already loaded on the phones of most of their target market, and have a brand advantage with a decades-long head start on any American competitors who try to enter the market.\n\n[The Score's revenue over the last 12 months is just over $20M.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCR.TO/financials?p=SCR.TO) **If we are conservative, and estimate that they achieve a 10% market share in Ontario, that's about 150M to $210M in revenue**. Meaning, that **Ontario revenues alone could increase the Score's annual revenue by 7.5 to 10.5 times their current levels**.\n\n...and that's just one Canadian market. The Score is the top sports app across Canada, and will have easy footholds into other Canadian markets once they open, too. They are a local Canadian player who have never skirted the rules by operating offshore, and who have expertise operating in heavily regulated markets since they were a broadcaster. As such, they are a prime candidate for any Canadian government to support through the regulatory process.\n\nOntario represents about 35-40% of Canada's population, so the above revenue projections are only the start. Markets in Alberta, BC, Quebec, and other smaller provinces would be significant boons to follow.\n\nAnd, of course, as the #2 sports app in the US, The Score is constantly entering new American markets. Iowa just opened in the last couple of weeks. [A Score representative just testified before the Ohio Senate Select Committee yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks/comments/lrq2ot/for_an_inside_scoop_read_the_scrs_testimony_today/). Being publicly listed and regulated on the Nasdaq can only help The Score's push to be regulated in more and more US markets.\n\nOne of the things that any marijuana stock investor has seen over the years is that legalization provides numerous catalysts for stock growth. Rumours of legalization, election of pro-legalization representatives, each step of the legislative process, etc. There are tons of catalysts that we will see as sports betting gets legalized across Canada and the US...and the next catalyst is the Nasdaq uplist tomorrow, which will allow ETF and other institutional investors to buy into the stock. While there isn't official confirmation that the uplist will be tomorrow, whether it is tomorrow or next week, the uplist should be a serious catalyst for the stock, both short and long term.\n\n[With their IPO on the Nasdaq, The Score has secured funding of $162M](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224006208/en/theScore-Announces-Pricing-of-Upsized-Initial-Public-Offering-in-the-United-States#:~:text=The%20underwriters%20have%20agreed%20to,announced%205%2C000%2C000%20Class%20A%20Shares). So, they are also flush with cash to pursue all the growth opportunities I discussed above.\n\n**...But there's more**\n\nWhile sports betting will be the big short term driver of the stock, there is another driver which is probably coming behind it: eSports betting.\n\nWhile The Score hasn't announced plans to launch an eSports betting platform, the move seems like a no-brainer.\n\nThe CEO of The Score, John Levy, has his sons work with him at the company. They each work in different areas, and one of them happens to be big into eSports. So, dad let him run with it and build an eSports platform. [At the time that I write this, The Score eSports has 1.64M subscribers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSCoziKHqjqbox3Fv3Pb4BA).\n\nThey have recently started using their background in broadcasting, and their platform in eSports, and [obtained exclusive English broadcasting rights for the League of Legends Demacia Championship](https://mobile.thescore.com/2020/12/thescore-esports-named-exclusive-english-language-broadcast-partner-for-league-of-legends-demacia-championship/).\n\nThe formula they used with the sports app was: create the platform, acquire the users, then find a way to monetize it (ie. sports betting).\n\nOnce The Score makes their push into sports betting, is there any reason why they wouldn't use the exact same technology, along with their eSports presence, to push into eSports betting?\n\nIt just seems like such an obvious next step which, at the moment, has a very low barrier to entry.\n\nThis is an emerging area, which most of the big sports betting players don't currently participate in, but is one that could see major growth in future years (especially as the comparably young demographics of eSports players get old enough to legally bet). With an existing eSports platform to leverage, and a sports betting platform already operating, The Score are positioned very well to take advantage of this future growth driver, when the time is right.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn recent years, we have seen a ton of retail investors enter the market. A lot of them have their main investments with a broker, while they use their investment \"fun money\" to day trade. The companies that you are seeing inflate to wild valuations right now are companies that engage in \"fun\" highly visible industries which appeal to those retail investors.\n\nWith that context: Oh, what a time to be a business with huge growth prospects in sports betting and esports!\n\nAs Canadian legalization has come closer, The Score saw a run-up in it's value up to a high of $5.67/share. Over the last week, they executed a 10:1 reverse share split, in order to facilitate their Nasdaq entry. Between that, profit taking, the announcement of the IPO share sales, and a couple of generally bad market days, the stock's value has dropped down to about $35.70/share (equivalent of $3.61 if compared to pre-reverse split prices). That value is in Canadian dollars, so the equivalent of about 28.42 in USD.\n\nWith all that now priced into the stock, this looks like the perfect time to get in. As of tomorrow (probably), when the Nasdaq listing goes up, US institutional investors and ETF's will be able to get in on the stock. Once further catalysts hit, for legalization and opening, The Score has a chance to soar in value.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an investment advisor. This is not investment advice. This is for entertainment purposes only. Do your own due diligence.\n\nDisclosure: I currently own 800 shares of The Score, with 500 of those shares being added this week, and I may increase my position further in the coming days.\n\nEdit: SCR actually has gone live, and is now trading on the Nasdaq.",
