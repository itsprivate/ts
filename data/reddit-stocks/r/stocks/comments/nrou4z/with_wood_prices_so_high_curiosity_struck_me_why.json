But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. \n\nOne thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. \n\n* West Fraser: 130% \n\n* Canfor 180%\n\n* Weyerhaeuser 80%\n\n* Resolute Forest **500%**\n\nWhy is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. \n\nLooking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.\n\nThere are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**West Fraser**\n\n\n:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | increase of\n---|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 1,137,000,000 | 735,000,000 | 21%\nSales | 2,343,000,000* | 890,000,000 | 163%\nCOGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%\nSelling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%\nNet Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**\n\n*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. \n\nWest Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Canfor**\n\n\n:) | Q4.2020 | Q4.2019 | Increase of\n--|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 867,500,000 | 803,900,000 | 8%\nSales | 5,454,400,000 | 4,658,300,000 | 17%\nCOGS | 3,538,800,000 | 3,618,600,00 | -2%\nSelling, G and A | 127,900,000 | 124,900,000 | 2.4%\nNet Earnings | 559,900,000 | -269,700,000 | WTF?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Weyerhaeuser**\n\n\n:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | Increase Of\n--|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 505,000,000 | 443,000,000 | 14%\nSales | 2,506,000,000 | 1,728,000,000 | 45%\nCOGS | 1,430,000,000 | 1,382,000,000 | 3%\nSelling, G and A | 90,000,000 | 74,000,000 | 22%\nNet Earnings | 681,000,000 | 150,000,000 | 354%\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Resolute Forest Products**\n\n\n\n3 months ending March 31st | 2021 | 2020 | Increase Of\n--------------------------|----|----|-----------\ninventories | 512,000,000 | 462,000,000 | 11%\nSales | 873,000,000 | 689,000,000 | 27%\nCOGS | 522,000,000 | 524,000,000 | ~\nSelling, G and A | 46,000,000 | 34,000,000 | 35%\nNet Earnings | 87,000,000 | -1,000,000 | another one turning things around\n\n\nSome interesting things to point out:\n\n* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. \n\n* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. \n\n* Although \"Selling, G&A\" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.\n\n* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. \n\nEverything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future. Thank you.",
