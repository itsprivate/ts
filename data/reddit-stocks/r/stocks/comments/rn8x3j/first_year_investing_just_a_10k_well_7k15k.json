Started of course by buying calls, then dabbled in selling calls and puts, and basically I feel really comfortable selling calls. My strike price is always a decent bit above my average cost, so if it gets assigned, then oh well, I'm forced to take some profit (and paid a little premium for it!) I try to sell calls when the stock is on a rise, and either let them expire or buy them back at 50%+, if I think I can sell another call soon. \n\nI feel like I'm missing what the downside of this strategy is? I kind of love it, and wish I had been doing this all along. I don't have the capital to sell puts but if I did, I think selling puts (and possibly having to buy stock at a discount, then selling calls on it) and calls would be pretty much exclusively what I do. \n\nI have about 600 shares of 23AndMe $ME, and though the stock hasn't soared, I'm till positive on it (*edit*: I think this isn't true haha. I'm about 18% down on commons, but I've made some back in selling calls, and got assigned on another couple hundred shares earlier at a profit, and feel pretty good about its future) and have taken quite a bit of premium just for holding the stock! $RKLB (only 104 shares) and Cleveland-Cliffs ($CLF), which I had a large position in, but did get assigned from a call (at a profit, so I'm not complaining?) And some various things, $MSFT, etc. But just thinking about stocks I can accumulate with my meager portfolio/income.\n\nAny insight into downsides I'm missing, or tickers to look at, or if you want to educate me a little on what to look at with The Greeks, I would appreciate any of it!
