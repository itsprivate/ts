Nobody, not any of us, have a crystal ball. It feels like there are two big camps both trying to shout over each other; one saying that the crash to end all crashes is imminent, the other saying the market has fundamentally changed and boom and bust is over.\n\nThat noise can be deafening. Meanwhile we all have itchy trigger fingers over our portfolios to either buy or sell.\n\nIn a way, we are in uncharted waters. In others, we aren't. Covid and the rise of \"big tech\" is new, but major conglomerates gaining unrivaled market dominance is not. Stupid IPO valuations and penny stocks are not new, neither are investors chasing fads. As ever, whoever is shouting is generally hoping you will click their link or trade their way so they can make money. Honest brokers they are not.\n\nI held my nerve during the Covid crash last year, then sold up in July fearing a second wave. I bought back in late November after the vaccine was announced, and am up 22% in two months. Naturally I'm very happy with this, but it's also irrelevant.\n\nEvery single private investor should be looking at the long game. Your stocks should never be your sole source of equity, and you certainly shouldn't be relying on it for income. If there is a reasonable chance you need access to that money in less than five years, you need to reassess what you can and can't afford to lose.\n\nWe don't know what is around the corner, but chances are that the golden rules of investing are still relevant today. Dollar cost averaging and a well diversified portfolio are your friends, do not plunge all into a few hype stocks.\n\nTo quote British fund manager Terry Smith; buy good companies, do not overpay, do nothing. If the stock you invested in is genuinely strong with a good balance sheet, it will weather whatever market correction comes our way. And if it does come, remember that you pre-planned for this, so you have no need to panic sell.\n\nKeep calm, and carry on. Take this time to assess your whole financial position - not just your stocks - and act accordingly.\n\nJust my £0.02.",
