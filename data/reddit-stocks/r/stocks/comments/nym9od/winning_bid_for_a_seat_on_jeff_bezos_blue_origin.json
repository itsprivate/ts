  "selftext": "The winning bid for a seat on Blue Origin's first-ever space tourism flight came in at an eye-popping $28 million during a Saturday live auction.  \n\n\nThe winner will be joining Blue Origin's founder Jeff Bezos on the New Shepard spacecraft for an 11-minute trip to the edge of space scheduled to blast off on July 20. The name of the winner will be released in coming weeks, the company said.  \n\n\nBidding on Saturday opened at $4.8 million and quickly shot up to $28 million. Blue Origin opened the auction for a seat on the inaugural crewed New Shepard flight on May 5 and more than 7,000 people from 159 countries registered, the company said on Saturday. Some of those bidders will be contacted about taking a seat on future space flights, the company said.  \n\n\nIn order to qualify for the \"Astronaut Experience,\" participants must meet a series of requirements set forth by Blue Origin, including the ability to deal with heights, walk on uneven surfaces, and handle up to three times the individual's weight. The participant will fill out a long series of waivers, as well as complete a special Blue Origin training program.  \n\n\nBezos and the rest of the crew will float around the cabin of the spacecraft for just three minutes before strapping in again for the descent back to the ground.  \n\n\nVirgin Galactic — Sir Richard Branson's space tourism company — has sold tickets for about $250,000 to about 600 passengers.   \n\n\nLink: [https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-origin-auction-spacecraft-jeff-bezos-winner-seat-astronaut-2021-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-origin-auction-spacecraft-jeff-bezos-winner-seat-astronaut-2021-6)",
