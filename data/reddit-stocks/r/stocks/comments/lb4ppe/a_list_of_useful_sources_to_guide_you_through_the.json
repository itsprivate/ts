We have seen a major recent price run up of the underlying equities and an increase in spot price of uranium should follow soon to justify the narrative. I have mentioned the following sentence in my previous post, but I will do so again just in case some people have no read that one: “This rally was built on historic seasonality, bipartisan support from the US government and their strategic reserve bill, geopolitical backing of nuclear power, the closing of Cigar Lake (one of the world’s largest uranium mines) and the covering of uranium investing by some of the more mainstream investment outlets”.\n\nThe uranium market is opaque, lots of information is not available to the public and it can be hard to navigate a sector like this. Knowing this, I have made a list of some of the most important and useful sources of information one needs to get a good foundation for this investment thesis (disclaimer: I am not receiving any financial or other sort of compensation for this, the picks on this list are chosen purely based on quality and usefulness to investors of the uranium sector. There are many other options, which you will surely find via the below mentioned suggestions).\n\nBefore I share it though, I wanted to mention that I have been accused time and again of pumping the uranium market or being a snake oil salesman who wants to profit off of the people on here, on the merit that I can’t possibly be sharing all this information with good intentions in mind. This is blatantly false, I write these posts so that fellow retail investors may possibly enjoy outsized returns that can allow them to do things that might otherwise not have been possible. If I get even one message saying that because of something I wrote, someone was able to put themselves or their kid through college, was able to pay down bad debt, go on that long awaited vacation or buy their dream house, every letter I wrote and every one of my hundreds of replies under each one of my posts on here, all of that, will have been worth it. Now that I got that out of the way, here is the list:\n\n   \n \n\nSector data:\n\n[https://www.uxc.com/](https://www.uxc.com/)\n\n[https://numerco.com](https://numerco.com/)\n\n[https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl\\_14100](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_14100)\n\n   \n \n\nSector coverage:\n\n[https://www.haywood.com/what-we-offer/research](https://www.haywood.com/what-we-offer/research)\n\n[https://www.cameco.com/](https://www.cameco.com/)\n\n[https://www.urnmetf.com/about](https://www.urnmetf.com/about)\n\n   \n \n\nTwitter:\n\n[u/uraniuminsider](https://www.reddit.com/user/uraniuminsider)\n\n[u/quakes99](https://www.reddit.com/user/quakes99)\n\n[u/Yellowbull11](https://www.reddit.com/user/Yellowbull11)\n\n[u/Uraniumsir](https://www.reddit.com/user/Uraniumsir)\n\n[u/808sandU3O8](https://www.reddit.com/user/808sandU3O8)\n\n   \n \n\nMust watch/read:\n\n[https://www.macrovoices.com/podcast-transcripts/899-mike-alkin-guy-keller-uranium-special](https://www.macrovoices.com/podcast-transcripts/899-mike-alkin-guy-keller-uranium-special)\n\n[https://investingnews.com/category/daily/resource-investing/energy-investing/uranium-investing/](https://investingnews.com/category/daily/resource-investing/energy-investing/uranium-investing/)\n\n[https://thetideoffortune.com/would-you-have-made-a-fortune-in-uranium-part-1/](https://thetideoffortune.com/would-you-have-made-a-fortune-in-uranium-part-1/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this list helps anyone invested in or looking to invest in the uranium sector. Remember that this sector is extremely volatile and you need both great patience and conviction to stick to the trade and reap the rewards at the end of it. Setting tight stop losses or taking early profits will almost certainly result in losing out on significant upside (nothing wrong with taking a profit, this is just my view). Trying to trade in and out of this bull market trying to time the cycles is also nearly impossible so unless you know exactly what to do (and even that is debatable), it is advised to buy and hold for the duration of this bull cycle, which I think will be around 5 years, give or take 2 years on either side of that. \n\nAs always, make sure to do your own research and only use my posts as a platform for further research into this sector. Most of my posts, or the hundreds of comments that have been placed below it, will answer any question you may have so please make sure to read those first to get up to speed. Lastly I will not be giving any company/ticker suggestions, in order to not violate any of the rules of this subrerddit. Best of luck in this investment and thank you all for the support, it has been a real pleasure receiving so many positive messages amongst all the critics and naysayers. Cheers!",
