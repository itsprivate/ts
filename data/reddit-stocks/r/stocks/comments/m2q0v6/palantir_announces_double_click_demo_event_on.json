Double Click is Palantir's series of software demo events that showcase how the company's platforms are used across these industries and customers.\n\nThe first event will feature in-depth demonstrations of Palantir Foundry for life sciences and industrials. Palantir’s customers in these verticals include Merck, NIH, NHS, 3M, bp, PG&E, LANXESS, Doosan, and others. The software demos at Double Click will showcase how customers can use Archetypes, Palantir’s solution to deploy end-to-end use cases in a matter of clicks, on top of Foundry, including:\n\nLife Sciences: harmonized patient view, clinical and observational data curation, prognostic model management, accelerated discovery via scientific research collaboration\n\nIndustrials: end-to-end quality assurance, production optimization, high-scale IoT analytics, supply chain optimization\n\nAdvance registration is required, and is available at https://palantir.events/doubleclick.

For any questions regarding the event, please email double-click@palantir.com.\n\nDidn't see anyone post about it yesterday, so I thought I'd create a thread and see what people have to say. I think these kinds of demo events will only boost PLTR, especially in the long-term.",
