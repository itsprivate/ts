I'm just trying to break down the given numbers on Karp's recent stock sales.   \nAlex Karp has sold over 54 million shares so far according to [http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951](http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951)According to [https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c](https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c) his last file date states he has around 85 million shares. After his recent selloff, Alex Karp still holds around 65.9 million shares. So that means he has sold around 45% of his total PLTR shares up to this date. Now, these numbers may not be exact but 54 million shares at $20 per share roughly make up that $ 1.1 billion dollars. Can someone verify this seems like an excessive amount?\n\nAccording to Karp (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html) ), this sale is to offset taxes from his share options.\n\nAfter some more calculations, Karp now holds roughly around 4.25%ish stake in PLTR. Given that (66mil shares/86mil shares \\* 0.055 stakes (source number from [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr) ownership) It seems like Karp gave up around 3.45% of his stake in PLTR to offset taxes.\n\nHowever, according to the SEC filing, Karp holds an initial 68.8 million options contracts that are due to expire on December 3rd. He still holds a majority of them although undisclosed at this point. Will be interesting to see what he does with them.
