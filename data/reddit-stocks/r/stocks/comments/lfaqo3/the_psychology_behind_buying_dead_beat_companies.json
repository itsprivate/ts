Would you rather buy companies that are probably going to have incredible growth in the future but you're going to have to pay a lot now to get on the train, or you can buy companies that are probably going to have below average to average growth but you get to buy the shares at a low price?\n\nSo high price for high growth, or low price for low growth? That's the question I'm asking... And from many posts I see especially on /r/investing and /r/UKInvesting and sometimes on /r/stocks, it seems like people overwhelmingly prefer buying average run of the mill companies just because the share price isn't high, over the companies of tomorrow because their price is high.\n\nBut if there's one thing investing over the years has taught me it's that the share price of great companies is usually always high (or close to it), and with good reason. Why are so many people put off from buying a stock because the price is high? You shouldn't be investing in a company based off the share price anyway.\n\nTake the ARK funds for example, we all know *almost* every company in every fund has amazing potential and many will likely become multi hundred billion dollar companies that will revolutionise the world we live in, and yet people are scared to buy in because the price is high? \n\nInstead they'd rather buy Exxon mobil, Carnival, Rolls Royce or some other beat down stock even though they **KNOW** these companies are nothing to write home about and their growth is very limited going forward. \n\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a company of tomorrow whose share price isn't high, and even the few times when they do drop 50% or more it's usually still considered too high for many people to pull the trigger, so they keep waiting for it to go even cheaper and end up missing it completely. So does this mean you're never going to invest in tomorrow? \n\nIt's such a fascinating thing to observe I just want to start a little conversation around it.",
