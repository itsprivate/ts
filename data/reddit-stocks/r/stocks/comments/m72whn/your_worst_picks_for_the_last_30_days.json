After reading some additional DD from other Redditors, their summary that Lemonade will simply be out leveraged in an already stiff market makes sense. Being new to investing, I made the mistake of buying quickly and not following research. Just for anybody else's sake, please don't make the mistake of buying LMND. It's complete garbage and would be surprised if I break even again with the initial investment.",
