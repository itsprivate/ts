  "selftext": "So I have been interested in stocks for the last 12 months. I haven’t invested any money yet but will be doing it during the next month or so. I am very young (17M) and looking to invest in the long term. This sub has given me lots of good hints whether it was a ticker or something else. Thank you for that.\n\nTo the main point. I am looking to do a diversed portfolio with big tech companies such as AAPL and MSFT having the major percentages of the portfolio. Don’t worry I know I’m young and will be doing some riskier investments/growth stocks (probably in tech). BUT seeing the result of COVID-19 doing some damage in the short term (and maybe little on the long term) I also need SOME stocks in different sectors which don’t get so much damage/ are less volatile than compared to some tech stocks WITH the ”safer” companies also paying good dividends and are able to up their dividend consistantly. \n\nQuestion nro. 1 goes like this: Can you name some of these stocks? I will be doing my research on my own still, but it helps a ton if you people can name some of these. I’ve already look some of them, which I’ll be investing in and these gets us to question nro 2...\n\nQuestion nro. 2: These are the stocks I’ve already looked up, let me know if they are any good: $PG, $JNJ and $PEP.\n\nAnd of course, thanks in advance.",
