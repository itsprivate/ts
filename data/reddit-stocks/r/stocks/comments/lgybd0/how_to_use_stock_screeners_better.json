I've linked a screen capture of the options it gives you.\n\nSecond, if it is even possible, can someone tell me what fields i would want to use if I am looking for stocks that are in a longer upward trend but are down in the short term? Would I just use something like the 200sma and maybe the 20sma for that? Are there more efficient ways to do something like that?
