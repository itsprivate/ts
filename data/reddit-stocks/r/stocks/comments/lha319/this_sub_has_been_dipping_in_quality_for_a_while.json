Before the whole GME ordeal I actually found most of the subs to be at least 30 percent quality posts on an average day, with stocks being more close to around 60 percent. These are based on the top threads I would look at when browsing the subreddit. \n\nNowadays stocks seems to be going through a \"DD renassaince\" where people are posting DD about any company that catches their eye. My problem is a lot of them aren't actually due diligence and mostly akin to affiliate marketing. You can tell who is just trying to pump up their stock  so they can get a bunch of new investors before they can move on to their next play. \n\nI have a few suggestions for the mods but of course they aren't perfect, I'm just brainstorming. \n\n1. Several flairs will require character limits. We don't need three paragraph DD's, or constant speculation without discussion. I think any flair relating to a company or industry should have a minimum of 10,000 characters. Mods can play around with the character limits but if someone can't even make up that much which in alll honestly is a 5 min read on an average blog page, then they aren't looking for a discussion. They are creating an ad. \n2. There should be a new rule that every DD, must include at least ONE negative thing about the company in which they are talking about, whether it be debt, competition etc. Perfect unicorn companies are once in a blue moon. EVERY company has faults, the point is how they deal with those faults and overcome them. \n3. There should be weekly megathreads to contain discussion of whatever stock of the week there is. \n\nThese of course are all just suggestions, and I invite anyone to offer their own suggestions as I want to see this sub grow properly and not turn into a wallstreetbets or pumpandump.",
