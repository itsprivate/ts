On Sunday I released [the stocks on my watchlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kclawm/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/) for the week and entered all of them come Monday. The only one I sold shortly after was HYLN for a $60 loss. In the end I decided to avoid that ticker. I also had a position entered on NIO, which was another EV play.\n\nMy account hit $90k today. When I began these posts I think 6 weeks ago, I was only at $75k. Hopefully can continue moving on up with the same returns moving forward.\n\nDue to the fact most my positions are still in the green of 20-30%. I foresee myself holding them until next week. It's also going to be the holidays so my trading will be light. I'll still make a short list of stocks this Sunday that I will be keeping an eye on though!\n\nPositions from this week still open: **CODX, OSTK, U, WKHS, NIO**\n\nI'm going to be looking to hold these for another 2-7 days and hopefully close them all out at +70% profit. We will see.\n\nThanks everyone who's been following this journey from the start. Thanks to the haters that thought my plays were dumb too, made me really be sure to enter these positions before I did.\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/VU2zQiU)",
