I have 10k saved up and I have a pretty stable minimum wage job on the side, while also studying. \n\nSo I was wondering how you guys make your DD. Obviously I'm not looking to copy and paste methods, but I'd like some ideas and inspiration to be able to analyse a company/stock by myself and create my own method. You can also refer me to links, videos and other resources.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated!",
