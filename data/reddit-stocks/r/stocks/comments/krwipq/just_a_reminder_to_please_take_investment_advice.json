Most of it is just [people talking into their cameras boasting high returns and advertising a paid \"class\" of their's where you can learn their secrets](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343606698896973825?s=20), or just [risky as hell advice like \"IPO's can only go up\" so you should invest in Doordash](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1336360876169785344?s=20)\n\n*Especially with the stimulus package*, there's some [very predatory videos](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1344410208429289474?s=20) claiming you should use that [$600 \"stimmy\" and get RICH QUICK](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1346139667939340289?s=20) like them by investing in their specific stock portfolio that is GUARANTEED to go up (because past performance = guarantees right?).\n\nI'd hope that no one in their right mind would listen to this shit but there is a [massive audience on Tiktok](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343613688767422464?s=20) that this sort of misinformation is targeted at, ie. GenZ/young investors that may only know of the stock market as of 2020. From the article I posted at the beginning on these tiktok investors:\n\n> “You’ve only been investing since April and have only seen a bull market since then,” they added. “Because you’re talking about money, you have hundreds of thousands following you because everyone wants to make money. You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”\n> \n> Take, for example, @kriskrohn. Kris Krohn is a Gary Vee-style motivational speaker who offers mentorships on real estate investing.\n> \n> On TikTok, he recommends that followers forgo investing via a 401(k), calling the accounts, “fake funny money,” that you “can’t use” and “can’t invest.” Instead, he advocates that his 250,000 followers invest in real estate.\n> \n> Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nIf these financial moguls were so filthy rich from their investments, why are they *selling* a class for a fee? They could easily make exponentially more by simply using their secret strategies and investing more rather than spend their time getting $20 from a teenager on tiktok...unless that's how they actually make money??\n\nThey are snake oil salesmen repackaged to target younger generations. Don't fall for it kids.",
