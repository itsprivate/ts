The vehicle is a compact SUV that resembles Toyota’s popular Rav-4, but is built on a entirely new platform and features a distinctive yoke instead of a traditional steering wheel, as well as a system that can recharge the car’s battery using solar power.\n\nBy 2025 Toyota plans to introduce 15 EVs, including seven “bZ” series models globally, said Toyota Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda, speaking at a briefing Monday. The bZ4X is the first of the “bZ” series, which stands for “beyond zero,” or cars that exceed being “just zero-emission,” according to Toyota. Toyota plans to produce the bZ4X in Japan and China and sell it worldwide by mid-2022.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/toyota-begins-electrification-push-with-new-ev-suv-platform?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/toyota-begins-electrification-push-with-new-ev-suv-platform?srnd=premium)\n\nDisclaimer: I do not hold shares in Toyota Motor Corp",
