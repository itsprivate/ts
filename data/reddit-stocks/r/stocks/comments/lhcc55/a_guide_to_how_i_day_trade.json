Try to average 2-4% gains per trade, if it goes down 2-4% you can either take a loss and move on or if there’s no bad news and you’re confident it should go back up, dollar cost average to lower your entry price.\n\n3. Manage your emotions no matter what way the stock heads, if you’re panicking when it goes down you’re more inclined to make a bad decision, if a stock goes up, don’t pat yourself on the back thinking this is easy and get used to winning.\n\n4. Risk management, sometimes there will be bad news and the stock might open 10% lower. If this news is not potentially going to end the company, you’ll need to dictate more time to holding your position. Generally stocks tend to go up overtime.\n\n5. AVOID MEME STOCKS. By the time it became a meme the party’s already over, also avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) if a stock has risen too much too quickly, people will sure be taking profit.\n\n6. The more money you have on the table the more the gains and losses, if you’re making 2-4% profit per day trading day (roughly 253 days) that’s roughly 500-1000% gains in a year.\n\n7. If you’re a beginner, start small and find your own method eventually that works best for you.\n\n8. There’s a rule called pattern day trading, if you’re trading with below $25k in cash balance and stocks, you can only make 3 day trades in a 5 day trading period otherwise a 90 day trading ban.\n\nI’ve been using this method and it’s working out really well for me so far. \n\nFeel free to list your own methods that works for you :)",
