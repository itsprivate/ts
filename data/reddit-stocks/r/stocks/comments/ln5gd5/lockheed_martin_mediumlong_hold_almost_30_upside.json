It took about a month, but it did hit the $75 price target and has been hovering from $70-$72 price range since. Had 25% gains easy.

Also, I'm not a cat.\n\nMedian Price Target : $421.50\n\nAverage Price Target: $429.89\n\nCurrent Price: $336+-\n\nPotential Upside: 28%+\n\nLooking at the charts, it's plainly a large defense company laggard. No significant news coming out of the defense department lately - which is overall a good thing for the world, imo. However, that leaves opportunity to make money on the stock when the news does come.\n\nHere's some rudimentary TA: Notice the momentum (weekly) at the bottom, and my exit point. I expect another 1-4 months before hitting my exit. Obviously, the goal for investing is to buy low and sell high - this is that opportunity if you are prepared to hold in the medium term.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt](https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could write a long winded DD about Space Force, growing tensions with China and the issues the US has with their growing military, their acquisition of AeroJet RocketDyne (Raytheon is pissed and filed with the DOJ because of it), the Russian hacks, etc. However, I'm lazy and I think the price targets, TA, logic, and life experience are good enough for me.\n\nCheers.",
