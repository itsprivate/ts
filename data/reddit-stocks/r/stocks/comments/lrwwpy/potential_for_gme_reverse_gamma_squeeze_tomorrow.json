When we crossed the $50 mark around 2:40pm today, they needed to start hedging really heavily since there was ~25,000 volume on the $50 calls, plus another ~23,000 volume on the $60 calls (plus all the volume in between).

So I think this could drop hard tomorrow, as in quicker than the ~3-5 days it took in January.\n\nOn top of that, if the price does start to drop somewhat significantly, the MMs can start to un-hedge their options that now are OTM, which means they'd be selling large amounts of the shares they just bought today, essentially causing a reverse gamma squeeze.\n\nIf by chance retail buying surprises me and is really strong tomorrow, then we can sustain a price above $168 or wherever we open tomorrow.
