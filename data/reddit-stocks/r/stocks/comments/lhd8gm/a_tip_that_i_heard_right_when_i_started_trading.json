This is part of growing and learning as an investor.\n\nBut the thing that many people forget is the **almost** trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn't. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but *something* made us pass on it. \n\n#Write them down.#\n\nRecord every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn't make the trade.\n\nThis has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, \"man - if only I held this longer\" or \"I really messed up buying this on the rise\". But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn't a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.\n\nIf you don't record the moves you **almost** made, then you're missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.\n\nHope this can help others as much as it's helped me. Good luck y'all!",
