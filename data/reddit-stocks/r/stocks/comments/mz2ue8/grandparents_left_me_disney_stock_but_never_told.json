Apparently in 2016 the state I live in (Virginia) sold the stock as there are some laws that say(I'm terribly paraphrasing as I don't understand this at all) if nothing was done with the stock and it was deemed inactive, ownership of the stock is given to the state of the last known residence of the original owner.

Some friends of mine mentioned that with the Disney stock splits back in the 90s those 24 shares could have turned into a decent amount of cash.  I appreciate any insight you all could provide!",
