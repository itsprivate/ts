Btw, is it just me or do those option prices look steep?\n\nTL-DR: I think Facebook is dropping hard in the next 4-6 month.  YouTube is screwed as well, but I won't bet against Google.  I know FB has a ton of bright people working for them, but Apple is attacking their business model and it seems to be working.\n\nLittle background here.  I work for a D2C (direct to consumer) company and am very involved with marketing spend allocaction, analysis etc.  Basically Facebook has been a boon to these types of marketers for the past couple of years.  We spend on avg 400k-600k per month in Facebook advertising.  It's very profitable until late May when Apple fully rolled out iOS 14.1.\n\niOS 14.1 is essentially a first strike attach against FB & YT.\n\nPerhaps you've seen the latest Apple ads toting how great they are for privacy.  Here's what's really going on.  Advertisers like FB & YT are able to make money by tracking user behavour to deliver ads that will convert.  Apple decided to throw a huge wrench in their business model....and look like they are the champion of privacy at the same time - genius.  Seriously, this was a master stroke move.\n\nHere's the reality of what I'm seeing and have heard the same from other marketers.\n\nFacebook & YouTubes advertising platforms are basically broken.  I mean campaigns that we have run for 6mo's just stopped working.  We are cutting spend by 50%.  We want to spend more, but we can't justify it.  Not only that, but it's getting more expensive.  I'm not sure if this is due to other parties trying to spend their way out of the poor performance or FB increasing rates to make up for advertiser drop off.\n\nNot every company has in depth analytics like we do.  Some can go months before they realize that they just burned a pile of money.  Side note - this is great for companies like Pinterest that are intent based.  Similar to how search works...they know you are interested in certain subject so they send you relevant ads.  Also, Google search campaigns are still performing well.\n\nHere's my view on what's happening w/FB & YT.  If an iOS user upgrades to iOS 14+ they are automatically oped out from being tracked on the apps they use.  I don't know about Safari, but f you launch FB or YT on your iPhone then you look like a brand new user from an advertisers point of view.\n\nSerious advertisers use a funnel approach to FB advertising.  Top of funnel (TOF) is used for brand awareness.  Bottom of funnel (BOF) is used to target people who interacted with your ad.  BTW, an interaction could mean you hoverered over the ad, not just clicks.  With this new reality, advertisers cannot re-target iOS users on FB and YT effectively for BOF ads.  This is huge.  Now we're stuck with some basic demographic targeting for ads with no intent data points.  It's like every FB user who has opted out of tracking looks like a brand new user with not history.\n\nFrom FB & YT's point of view - every iOS user has no historical data to use in targeting.  You still have your friend list and YT subscriptions, but they can't use that data to target ads.  This might be fine for brand marketing but it doesn't work for performance marketing.  Performance marketing means we want you to interact with the ad and buy something.\n\nNow let's talk about attribution.  When FB/YT delivers you an ad, they will track whether you eventually bought the product - think the normal window is 28 days.  This means if you see an ad for a t-shirt, then go to the t-shirt company's website a week later and buy it...FB/YT take credit for the sale.  Now a good marketr knows that FB/YT doesn't deserve all the credit.  You may have advertised to them on some other medium...but FB/YT does deserve some credit.  If they hadn't seen the ad on FB/YT first they would never have eventually bought the shirt.\n\niOS 14 iis changing this as well.  I think the window is 7 days now...but might be less.\n\nMy ompany's sales are down 35% since iOS 14 rolled out.  Not only that but our FB/YT spend is down approx 40%.  In fact, I remember before the rollout happened our FB rep reached out to inquire what our spend budget was going to be for the year.  This is not normal.  Usually these platforms make you come to them and beg...they never reach out...and never ever for a budget plan.  We told them we planned on spending the same unless performanc changed..  Well, we're cutting spend by 50% and I have to imagin we're not the only ones.  Don't get me wrong - we want to spend more.  It's just not working out.\n\nAlso, has anyone noticed how much stock Zuck has been selling lately?  I think he's already doubled last year's number.\n\nOh, and FB nearly hit their all time high today.  Really, how is this possible.\n\nBTW - I have not interest in placing bets against Google.   Who in their right mind would place bets agains both of those giants.\n\nHere's my guess w/FB. I think they will come in a little low on earning on 7/19.  They have been increasing rates and traditionally they are the best place to advertise.  Howver, I think the cracks will really show on Q3 earning and continue to deteriorate in Q4.\n\nMy question is - if you had 20K-40K to invest in this scenario what would you do?  I'm thinking put options winter 2021 or Jan 2022.  Im assuming the stock is going to drop a \\~\\~hundred\\~\\~ $30 bucks between now and then.   How can I maximize my play with this set of assumptions?\n\nedit - Thanks for all the responses.  I've decided to wait to buy put options a week or two before earnings if the FB performance issues aren't resolved by then.   I would not be surprised if they took a 5% hit on earnings in Q2 and provide guidance for 10% reduced earnings in Q3.   \n\n&#x200B;",
