Now it's no longer only me taking care of the repo, but also 2 other experienced devs (thanks u/hbar340), who are adding features on a daily basis and increasing the robustness of the codebase. Feel free to wander through the FEATURES page to see what you would get out of this tool!\n\nIf some of you thought it was amazing 2 months ago, you won't believe what it looks like now.
