However both these indices are market weighted. Which means that the larger the company the more allocation it has in the index. Because of that, and because how giant S&P 500 companies are in comparison to the other 3,000 smaller companies, 95% of VTI is S&P 500. So 95% of VTI is VOO.  Check out their historical performance - very close. I wish I could paste a graph here. \n\nSo their performance is almost identical. VOO has a slightly higher dividend yield.

However if you truly want to have non-S&P exposure, you should add VXF (or maybe VO) as a complement to VOO. \n\nAlso, VTI is total US market. No international exposure.
