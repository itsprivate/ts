Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we’re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market.

People will think that Gamestop, AMC & Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. \n\nAnd I’m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill.

How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.\n\nSo all I’m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they’re comfortable losing with.
