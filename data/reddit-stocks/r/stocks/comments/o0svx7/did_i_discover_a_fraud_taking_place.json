They previously disclosed that they lost 20k worth of inventory because they were unable to collect payment due to a various factors. I went into their filings and press releases and the numbers didn't match up - I found out they shipped out closer to 400k that wasn't collected. So I asked the CEO this and he admitted, probably without remembering that they disclosed 25k, that they lost the 400k. When I pressed him on this he said \"our collection issues are well documented\" and stopped speaking to me. Now, I'm pretty resentful by nature and I don't appreciate being lied to and fucked around. So, I'm wondering if this failure to disclose/minimizing losses in official filings is fraud. If so, can I sue this company? \n\nDisclosure, I still hold shares, so I'm torn as to what I should do. \n\nThanks",
