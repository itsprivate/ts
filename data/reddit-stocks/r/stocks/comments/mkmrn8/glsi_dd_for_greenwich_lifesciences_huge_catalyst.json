This stock has shown what it can do, has already started running up, and i dont see any real posts of substance on here so I figured after the run up it had this morning that there would be a couple of curious traders coming on here to learn more. I hope this helps. \n\nExtremely long DD for the Pros!\n\nExtra rocketships for the bros!   🚀\n\nThe following is taken from my own personal DD so the format is not phenomenal (for instance, cant use any pictures) so just hmu if you want the complete DD in a \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreenwich LifeScience\n\n$GLSI\n\nPersonal DD for entertainment purposes only. This is not financial advice. Always conduct your own DD before opening any positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout $GLSI\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreenwich LifeSciences (Nasdaq: GLSI) is a public clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences in patients who have previously undergone surgery, that is developing GP2, a novel peptide immunotherapy, and is planning to commence a Phase III clinical trial ([https://greenwichlifesciences.com](https://greenwichlifesciences.com)).\n\nGP2 is derived from the HER2/neu protein, which is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including breast cancer.  Tumors with elevated expression of HER2/neu protein are highly aggressive, resulting in an increased disease recurrence and a worse prognosis.  In a Phase IIb clinical trial in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting, no breast cancer recurrences were observed after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized.  In addition, GP2 treatment is well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to GP2 immunotherapy were reported.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpcoming Potential Catalysts for 2021\n\nApril 9-10- Greenwich is to announces more GP2 data on at the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) annual meeting, where the company will release the final 5-year immune response results from its Phase IIb trial ([https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual)).\n\nThe AACR plans to publish two Greenwich LifeSciences abstracts on April 9, 2021 at 12:01 am EST and posters on April 10, 2021 on its Phase IIb clinical trial's final five year immune response data and its planned Phase III clinical trial updated design.\n\nObviously I can’t predict the future, but  I hypothesize- determinate on the outcome of the results- that price action will be fire in the premarket and could start as early as 04:00:01 est. For that reason I am planning to set a GTC, extended hours, limit order the night before (04/08) with a lofty price target as things can get crazy in the premarket with low volume and high volatility. \n\nPlanned Phase III Trial: 9 amino acid HER2/neu peptide + GM-CSF immunotherapy for breast cancer in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (postsurgery) in HER2/neu 3+, HLA-A2 patients in Y2 following Herceptin or Kadcyla. \n\nYou can see the clinical trial design here: [https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf](https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 Year Price History\n\n$GLSI IPO’d closed September 29th, 2020. The 180 day lock up period ended on March 24th, so one doesn’t need to worry about that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBreast Cancer\n\nI’m not going to go into an overview of what breast cancer is, if you want to know more->[https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F). But here are some easily digestible facts to illustrate it’s likelihood, frequency, and most importantly the unmet need for improved treatment\n\nOne in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, with approximately 266,000 new breast cancer patients and 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in 2018, all of whom have the potential to experience breast cancer recurrences (Source: American Cancer Society).\n\nHER2/neu 3+ (“HER2-positive”) breast cancer patients comprise approximately 25% of all breast cancer patients (Source: American Society of Clinical Oncology).\n\nFor women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. In 2021, it's estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancers.\n\nBreast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAbout 85% of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. These occur due to genetic mutations that happen as a result of the aging process and life in general, rather than inherited mutations.\n\nThe most significant risk factors for breast cancer are sex (being a woman) and age (growing older).\n\nThis is significant because these are not factors one can necessarily change, as opposed to being able to reduce your risk for lung cancer by not smoking, avoiding radiation, and radon, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand\\_bc/statistics](https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnmet Need\n\n[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\n$GLSI isn’t trying to replace current therapies, but work in tangent with them and is designed to be compatible with future derivatives:\n\n\t\t“GP2 can be the treatment that will naturally overlap with or follow Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu or any of the other Herceptin derivatives being developed” (pg. 6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the way I see this, GLSI isn’t trying to come into the marketplace as a competitor to the current treatment options available (which would be a much harder pitch to doctors who are currently using Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu) but as a supplementary treatment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“GP2 & GM-CSF starting in Year 2 act synergistically with Herceptin to prevent cancer recurrences, if fully immunized, reducing recurrence rates from 11% to 0% at median 5 years follow-up (p = 0.0338), with minimal to no side effects & no SAEs.”\n\n“In the initial GP2 indication, approximately 17,000 new patients could be treated per year, saving up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year.” (pg4)\n\nSide note: notice that the quote above didn’t really need to be said; and definitely not included in a presentation of clinical data (presumably every doctor scrutinizing the results can do simple math). As an investor, this is one of the many things that make me very bullish about GLSI. A company could get fantastic clinical results but as the average investor doesn’t know how to interpret the results, if the company doesn’t present them in an easily digestible form, many investors will (rightfully so) pass on trading that position.  And GLSI does that. You don’t even need a GED to open their PR, see “0% recurrence of breast cancer in 96 patients over 5 years” and “results indicate  GP2 could save up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year” to know that is great news and hop in a position trading on that news. More people trading => more volume, and on a low float stock like GLSI (2.69M shares according to yahfin) it will not take much to get the share price moving. If GLSI comes out and shows that the rest of their data is as good as their top-line, it will be a very profitable day for trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of cancer, imagine GLSI was focusing on migraines and their medicine gets FDA approved. Now why would the doctor prescribe GLSI over some other company that he has been prescribing for years and years he knows works fairly well (so harder to get into the marketplace = less sales = less revenue)? Not to mention the doctor’s probably got connections and fiscal incentives already connected to the current treatment options, so again there would be less incentive to prescribe GLSI. \n\nBut what if you went to the doctor’s with a migraine, got treated for your migraine using your doctor’s preferred treatment options (so he’s still happy) and then as a patient was provided with an option to take a booster pill. The doctor tells you, so far about 100 people have taken the booster pill and NONE of them have had ANY migraines in the 5 years since taking it. On top of that, there have been little to NO side effects after taking the booster pill.  So would you take the booster pill to safely and effectively eliminate the possibilities of a migraine every coming back (or at least, for the next 5+ years)?\n\nNow replace migraine with breast cancer, and that booster pill is $GLSI \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBreast cancer (ALL cancer) is extremely scary, I don’t even pretend to know what kind of impact that diagnosis  can have on one’s life. I am apart of a family who has been horribly affected by cancer and I know we would do anything to prevent having to relive that experience nightmare. And as breast cancer is the number 1 common cancer globally, I know my family is not alone in this feeling of desperation. \n\nELI5:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Details\n\n4 clinical trials. 138 treated breast cancer patients. ​\n\nNo cancer recurrences if fully immunized.  No reported serious adverse events.  Well tolerated safety profile.\n\nThus far, the safety and efficacy of the GP2 immunotherapy have been tested in four clinical trials, where 138 patients have received treatment to date. The past trials consist of three Phase I clinical trials and one Phase IIb clinical trial. \n\nIn a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center (16 sites) Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson and completed in 2018, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized with GP2 (p = 0.0338). \n\nFull immunization was received in the Primary Immunization Series (PIS), which included the first 6 GP2 + GM-CSF intradermal injections over the first 6 months.  The PIS elicited a potent immune response as measured by local skin tests and immunological assays.  Further, booster injections given every 6 months prolonged the immune response, thereby providing longer term protection.  In the Phase IIb and three Phase I clinical trials, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the GP2 immunotherapy. \n\n89 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF, 91 placebo patients treated with GM-CSF\n\n17 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF + trastuzumab\n\n14 patients treated with GP2 + AE37 + GM-CSF\n\n18 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop performing IPO in 2020 ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28)).\n\nOn December 8, 2020, GLSI share price closed at $5.20 per share. Then GLSI published its 5-year breast cancer data from a Phase IIb trial on December 9, which showed 0% breast cancer recurrences over 5 years of follow-up. On that day, the company's stock spiked to $158 per share and closed at $57 per share, surging the next day to $128 per share and closing at $72 per share. \n\nThis shows huge (positive) market sentiment towards the data and it is reasonable to assume the market will react similarly on similar news. Perhaps even stronger since this data set will be the complete results. \n\nThe company experienced another spike in share price on March 8, 2021, opening at $23 per share, spiking at $53 per share, before finally closing at $37 per share when it was announced that Dr. Jaye Thompson would be brought on full time to lead the GP2 Phase III trial in the fight against breast cancer. \n\nA 130% increase in share price just on the news of HIRING someone for phase III shows the market is still very much interested in Greenwich’s GP2 trial. \n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/03/20282424/greenwich-lifesciences-could-see-another-spike-in-stock-in-early-april](https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/03/20282424/greenwich-lifesciences-could-see-another-spike-in-stock-in-early-april)\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nInsider Information\n\nCEO Snehal Patel with 30 years of experience working in biopharma and Wall Street, Dr. Thompson has 30 years of experience managing over 200 clinical trials, CMO Joe Daugherty, who has assisted over 20 public and private biopharma companies, and Chairman David McWilliams, who on top of 45 years of experience has served as CEO of 2 private and 3 public biotech companies.

The objective of the coronavirus vaccine program is to leverage the development team’s experience in achieving 100% protection against lethal levels of pneumonic plague infection to increase the percent protection and duration of protection of coronavirus vaccines under development. It is not clear how long one will be protected by the current Covid-19 vaccines and none that have been developed to date offer 100% protection. We are hopeful that our approach, which showed 100% protection against pneumonic plague, may lead to greater and longer lasting protection compared to existing Covid-19 vaccines under development.”” [https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates)\n\nPersonally- is this a reason to buy GLSI?

In December 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering and raised $26,400,000 in gross proceeds and $23,959,000 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company met and exceeded those predictions thus mitigating any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05 and its ability to satisfy the estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $28,660,375.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1799788/000149315221007532/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1799788/000149315221007532/form10-k.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance Sheet FY20\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice Target General Consensus\n\n1 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Greenwich LifeSciences in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $75.00, predicting that the stock has a possible upside of 116.01%. The high price target for GLSI is $75.00 and the low price target for GLSI is $75.00. There are currently 1 buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of \"Buy.\" - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/GLSI/price-target/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/GLSI/price-target/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere’s never anything wrong with securing profits. A low risk strategy would be to secure profits on the run up by selling before the catalyst drops. \n\nOne optimal approach is sell enough shares to cover your cost basis and let your remaining shares ride into the catalyst. \n\nCuriously, GLSI has waited until circa 1:20 pm est to run on multiple occasions- I can’t even begin to speculate why but unless GLSI hits over $150 in the morning I will most likely be hanging out in the position until at least 2pm est. \n\nObviously, I’ll use TA to monitor the situation and will adjust my current strategy depending on new data. \n\nWith such a low float, low volume stock, poised to release such great news, it makes a realistic price target very hard to chart out or even predict with any confidence. If $GLSI can break past resistance in the low 50s, it could easily gap back up over 100 with enough volume. The possibility is there, the likelihood is unknown. \n\nI will be watching GLSI closely on 04/09, and will use indicators to help navigate the best exit price. Note, on their topline data, RSI went well past 95, so if one sold at 70 there would have been a lot of money left on the table.\n\nCouple final tips to help you determine when to sell:\n\nDon’t be greedy.\n\nNo one ever went broke taking profits.\n\nIf it’s worth screenshotting, it’s worth selling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInsider Trading\n\nFrom [https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi](https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi) we can see there were several insider purchases of the stock before the initial topline data was announced and have not see any selling of the stock, even during it’s 3000% run. This makes me very bullish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstitutional Ownership\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstitutional Ownership (cont’d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the highlighted institutions opened positions for the first time in GLSI (17 out of 19). Institutional buy ins from major players like Vanguard, Blackrock, BAC, and Wells Fargo makes me extremely bullish.",

In addition, GP2 treatment is well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to GP2 immunotherapy were reported.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Upcoming Potential Catalysts for 2021</p>\n\n<p>April 9-10- Greenwich is to announces more GP2 data on at the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) annual meeting, where the company will release the final 5-year immune response results from its Phase IIb trial (<a href=\"https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual\">https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The AACR plans to publish two Greenwich LifeSciences abstracts on April 9, 2021 at 12:01 am EST and posters on April 10, 2021 on its Phase IIb clinical trial&#39;s final five year immune response data and its planned Phase III clinical trial updated design.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I can’t predict the future, but  I hypothesize- determinate on the outcome of the results- that price action will be fire in the premarket and could start as early as 04:00:01 est. For that reason I am planning to set a GTC, extended hours, limit order the night before (04/08) with a lofty price target as things can get crazy in the premarket with low volume and high volatility. </p>\n\n<p>Planned Phase III Trial: 9 amino acid HER2/neu peptide + GM-CSF immunotherapy for breast cancer in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (postsurgery) in HER2/neu 3+, HLA-A2 patients in Y2 following Herceptin or Kadcyla. </p>\n\n<p>You can see the clinical trial design here: <a href=\"https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf\">https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>1 Year Price History</p>\n\n<p>$GLSI IPO’d closed September 29th, 2020. The 180 day lock up period ended on March 24th, so one doesn’t need to worry about that. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Breast Cancer</p>\n\n<p>I’m not going to go into an overview of what breast cancer is, if you want to know more-&gt;<a href=\"https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F\">https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F</a>. But here are some easily digestible facts to illustrate it’s likelihood, frequency, and most importantly the unmet need for improved treatment</p>\n\n<p>One in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, with approximately 266,000 new breast cancer patients and 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in 2018, all of whom have the potential to experience breast cancer recurrences (Source: American Cancer Society).</p>\n\n<p>HER2/neu 3+ (“HER2-positive”) breast cancer patients comprise approximately 25% of all breast cancer patients (Source: American Society of Clinical Oncology).</p>\n\n<p>For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. In 2021, it&#39;s estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancers.</p>\n\n<p>Breast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.</p>\n\n<p>About 85% of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. These occur due to genetic mutations that happen as a result of the aging process and life in general, rather than inherited mutations.</p>\n\n<p>The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are sex (being a woman) and age (growing older).</p>\n\n<p>This is significant because these are not factors one can necessarily change, as opposed to being able to reduce your risk for lung cancer by not smoking, avoiding radiation, and radon, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics\">https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Unmet Need</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf\">https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>$GLSI isn’t trying to replace current therapies, but work in tangent with them and is designed to be compatible with future derivatives:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    “GP2 can be the treatment that will naturally overlap with or follow Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu or any of the other Herceptin derivatives being developed” (pg. 6)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So the way I see this, GLSI isn’t trying to come into the marketplace as a competitor to the current treatment options available (which would be a much harder pitch to doctors who are currently using Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu) but as a supplementary treatment. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>“GP2 &amp; GM-CSF starting in Year 2 act synergistically with Herceptin to prevent cancer recurrences, if fully immunized, reducing recurrence rates from 11% to 0% at median 5 years follow-up (p = 0.0338), with minimal to no side effects &amp; no SAEs.”</p>\n\n<p>“In the initial GP2 indication, approximately 17,000 new patients could be treated per year, saving up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year.” (pg4)</p>\n\n<p>Side note: notice that the quote above didn’t really need to be said; and definitely not included in a presentation of clinical data (presumably every doctor scrutinizing the results can do simple math). As an investor, this is one of the many things that make me very bullish about GLSI. A company could get fantastic clinical results but as the average investor doesn’t know how to interpret the results, if the company doesn’t present them in an easily digestible form, many investors will (rightfully so) pass on trading that position.  And GLSI does that. You don’t even need a GED to open their PR, see “0% recurrence of breast cancer in 96 patients over 5 years” and “results indicate  GP2 could save up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year” to know that is great news and hop in a position trading on that news. More people trading =&gt; more volume, and on a low float stock like GLSI (2.69M shares according to yahfin) it will not take much to get the share price moving. If GLSI comes out and shows that the rest of their data is as good as their top-line, it will be a very profitable day for trading. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Instead of cancer, imagine GLSI was focusing on migraines and their medicine gets FDA approved. Now why would the doctor prescribe GLSI over some other company that he has been prescribing for years and years he knows works fairly well (so harder to get into the marketplace = less sales = less revenue)? Not to mention the doctor’s probably got connections and fiscal incentives already connected to the current treatment options, so again there would be less incentive to prescribe GLSI. </p>\n\n<p>But what if you went to the doctor’s with a migraine, got treated for your migraine using your doctor’s preferred treatment options (so he’s still happy) and then as a patient was provided with an option to take a booster pill. The doctor tells you, so far about 100 people have taken the booster pill and NONE of them have had ANY migraines in the 5 years since taking it. On top of that, there have been little to NO side effects after taking the booster pill.  So would you take the booster pill to safely and effectively eliminate the possibilities of a migraine every coming back (or at least, for the next 5+ years)?</p>\n\n<p>Now replace migraine with breast cancer, and that booster pill is $GLSI </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Breast cancer (ALL cancer) is extremely scary, I don’t even pretend to know what kind of impact that diagnosis  can have on one’s life. I am apart of a family who has been horribly affected by cancer and I know we would do anything to prevent having to relive that experience nightmare. And as breast cancer is the number 1 common cancer globally, I know my family is not alone in this feeling of desperation. </p>\n\n<p>ELI5:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Additional Details</p>\n\n<p>4 clinical trials. 138 treated breast cancer patients. ​</p>\n\n<p>No cancer recurrences if fully immunized.  No reported serious adverse events.  Well tolerated safety profile.</p>\n\n<p>Thus far, the safety and efficacy of the GP2 immunotherapy have been tested in four clinical trials, where 138 patients have received treatment to date. The past trials consist of three Phase I clinical trials and one Phase IIb clinical trial. </p>\n\n<p>In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center (16 sites) Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson and completed in 2018, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized with GP2 (p = 0.0338). </p>\n\n<p>Full immunization was received in the Primary Immunization Series (PIS), which included the first 6 GP2 + GM-CSF intradermal injections over the first 6 months.  The PIS elicited a potent immune response as measured by local skin tests and immunological assays.  Further, booster injections given every 6 months prolonged the immune response, thereby providing longer term protection.  In the Phase IIb and three Phase I clinical trials, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the GP2 immunotherapy. </p>\n\n<p>89 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF, 91 placebo patients treated with GM-CSF</p>\n\n<p>17 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF + trastuzumab</p>\n\n<p>14 patients treated with GP2 + AE37 + GM-CSF</p>\n\n<p>18 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Top performing IPO in 2020 (<a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28\">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28</a>).</p>\n\n<p>On December 8, 2020, GLSI share price closed at $5.20 per share. Then GLSI published its 5-year breast cancer data from a Phase IIb trial on December 9, which showed 0% breast cancer recurrences over 5 years of follow-up. On that day, the company&#39;s stock spiked to $158 per share and closed at $57 per share, surging the next day to $128 per share and closing at $72 per share. </p>\n\n<p>This shows huge (positive) market sentiment towards the data and it is reasonable to assume the market will react similarly on similar news. Perhaps even stronger since this data set will be the complete results. </p>\n\n<p>The company experienced another spike in share price on March 8, 2021, opening at $23 per share, spiking at $53 per share, before finally closing at $37 per share when it was announced that Dr. Jaye Thompson would be brought on full time to lead the GP2 Phase III trial in the fight against breast cancer. </p>\n\n<p>A 130% increase in share price just on the news of HIRING someone for phase III shows the market is still very much interested in Greenwich’s GP2 trial. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/03/20282424/greenwich-lifesciences-could-see-another-spike-in-stock-in-early-april\">https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/03/20282424/greenwich-lifesciences-could-see-another-spike-in-stock-in-early-april</a></p>\n\n<p>Market Sentiment</p>\n\n<p>Insider Information</p>\n\n<p>CEO Snehal Patel with 30 years of experience working in biopharma and Wall Street, Dr. Thompson has 30 years of experience managing over 200 clinical trials, CMO Joe Daugherty, who has assisted over 20 public and private biopharma companies, and Chairman David McWilliams, who on top of 45 years of experience has served as CEO of 2 private and 3 public biotech companies.

The objective of the coronavirus vaccine program is to leverage the development team’s experience in achieving 100% protection against lethal levels of pneumonic plague infection to increase the percent protection and duration of protection of coronavirus vaccines under development. It is not clear how long one will be protected by the current Covid-19 vaccines and none that have been developed to date offer 100% protection.

In December 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering and raised $26,400,000 in gross proceeds and $23,959,000 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company met and exceeded those predictions thus mitigating any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05 and its ability to satisfy the estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $28,660,375.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1799788/000149315221007532/form10-k.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1799788/000149315221007532/form10-k.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Balance Sheet FY20</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Price Target General Consensus</p>\n\n<p>1 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Greenwich LifeSciences in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $75.00, predicting that the stock has a possible upside of 116.01%. The high price target for GLSI is $75.00 and the low price target for GLSI is $75.00. There are currently 1 buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of &quot;Buy.&quot; - <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/GLSI/price-target/\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/GLSI/price-target/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There’s never anything wrong with securing profits. A low risk strategy would be to secure profits on the run up by selling before the catalyst drops. </p>\n\n<p>One optimal approach is sell enough shares to cover your cost basis and let your remaining shares ride into the catalyst. </p>\n\n<p>Curiously, GLSI has waited until circa 1:20 pm est to run on multiple occasions- I can’t even begin to speculate why but unless GLSI hits over $150 in the morning I will most likely be hanging out in the position until at least 2pm est. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I’ll use TA to monitor the situation and will adjust my current strategy depending on new data. </p>\n\n<p>With such a low float, low volume stock, poised to release such great news, it makes a realistic price target very hard to chart out or even predict with any confidence. If $GLSI can break past resistance in the low 50s, it could easily gap back up over 100 with enough volume. The possibility is there, the likelihood is unknown. </p>\n\n<p>I will be watching GLSI closely on 04/09, and will use indicators to help navigate the best exit price. Note, on their topline data, RSI went well past 95, so if one sold at 70 there would have been a lot of money left on the table.</p>\n\n<p>Couple final tips to help you determine when to sell:</p>\n\n<p>Don’t be greedy.</p>\n\n<p>No one ever went broke taking profits.</p>\n\n<p>If it’s worth screenshotting, it’s worth selling. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Insider Trading</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi\">https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi</a> we can see there were several insider purchases of the stock before the initial topline data was announced and have not see any selling of the stock, even during it’s 3000% run. This makes me very bullish. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Institutional Ownership</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Institutional Ownership (cont’d)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All of the highlighted institutions opened positions for the first time in GLSI (17 out of 19). Institutional buy ins from major players like Vanguard, Blackrock, BAC, and Wells Fargo makes me extremely bullish.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
