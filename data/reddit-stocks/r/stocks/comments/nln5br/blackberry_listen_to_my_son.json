He also told me to invest in Etheruem and in Jan I bought $250 worth and now I have over $1k in there. (I'm saving it for his college). Also kicking my ass for not buying more. Lol Well now he is telling me to invest in Blackberry. Does anyone know anything about this? I'm wondering if I should? I'll buy a little bit just to make him happy, but just wanted to see if anyone with knowledge could give me a suggestion? My son is pretty tech savvy and really smart with math. I'm just not sure if he just listening to some random people who don't know what they are talking about. Figured it's best to ask you experts! Thanks in advance. It's very much appreciated.",
