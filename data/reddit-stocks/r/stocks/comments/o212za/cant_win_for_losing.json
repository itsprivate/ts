I have an airline stock - Spirit Airlines - that has been getting upgrade after upgrade into the mid $40s and low $50s, but has been sinking like a stone for 2 months now, and is now at $33. They said it was because oil was going up. But today oil's down, and airlines are still taking it on the chin - hard.\n\nI guess I'm just venting... But it doesn't make any sense to me. No wonder people just throw their money into AMC and GME these days. What am I doing wrong?",
