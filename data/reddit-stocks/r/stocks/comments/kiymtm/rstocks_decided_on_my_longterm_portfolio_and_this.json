I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/khdoae/what_are_your_guaranteed_growth_stock_buys_for/) about stock recommendations for the future and tried to look more like a beginner. Not saying 5 years means I am an expert or hella knowledgeable, but I know what I am doing.\n\nThe experiment was to let r/stocks decide what a new portfolio will look like and later compare it to 2 of my own portfolios that work independently. Every mention of a stock to buy received a vote in the portfolio, multiple mentions means multiple votes and the total of 100% is split across them based on their votes. Note that some comments could not be added due to availability and others were added due to frequent recommendations on other posts that asked for future growth stocks. The portfolio is meant for the future, meaning nothing that is liquidated in 2021.\n\nBefore I posted I expected trolls and a large tendency to TSLA, PLTR, PYPL, MSF, AAPL. Not because I think those are straight up good (also not saying they are bad), but I looked around before I decided to do this and those were quite common to be mentioned. Reality looked different.\n\nThe 2 portfolios r/stock-portfolio will compete against (these have been running since early to mid December so they have a time advantage, which over the course of a year should barely make a difference):\n\n^(\\*Note: These are longterm portfolios.
