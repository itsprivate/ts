I haven't seen $RESN talked about recently so I decided to do a bit of a dive on it. (I apologize beforehand for lack of meme-speak and rockets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResonant Inc, a late-stage development company, designs and develops filters for radio frequency (RF) and front-ends used in the mobile device, automotive, medical, Internet-of-things, and related industries in the United States and internationally. It uses Infinite Synthesized Networks technology, a software platform to configure and connect resonators that are building blocks of RF filters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy is this important? Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G. Their technology allows to filter out lower frequencies that can overlap with 5G frequencies, critical as the RF spectrum becomes more and more congested. This technology has the potential to be in every 5G device.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, they signed a strategic investment and a licensing agreement to design 5G RF filters with their XBAR® technology, with Murata Manufacturing, THE biggest RF Filter and Duplexer manufacturer in the world. (Source: Navian, 2019)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn late December 2020, the company released a letter to shareholders indicating that they surpassed a shipment milestone of 50Million RF Filters, among other encouraging news. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150894/0/en/Resonant-Issues-Shareholder-Letter-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYesterday, February 9th 2021, they provided prelim FY2020 results, showing revenues increased 330% YoY to a Record $3.2 Million. Also reported that as of December 31, 2020, Resonant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.0 million, which included $11.0 million of net proceeds from sales of equity under the Company’s previously announced at-the-market (ATM) program. And as far as I can tell, no debt.

Resonant has reached a milestone with Murata Manufacturing allowing them to move to the next phase of building a commercial platform & high-volume manufacturing of XBAR-based RF filters for 5G. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/05/2103536/0/en/Murata-Manufacturing-Co-Ltd-the-World-s-Leading-RF-Module-and-Filter-Provider-and-Resonant-Inc-Confirm-Target-Performance-Packaging-and-Initial-Reliability-for-First-Mobile-XBAR-De.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInstitutional investors have also been steadily increasing their stake: \n\n* AWM Investment Co., Inc.\t7.70%\n* Longboard Capital Advisors LLC\t6.97%\n* BlackRock Fund Advisors\t4.77%\n* Select Equity Group LP\t4.66%\n* Park City Capital LLC\t3.69%\n* The Vanguard Group, Inc.\t3.18%\n\n43.44% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors, based on some early January numbers. Probably higher now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShort % of Float (Jan. 29, 2021) 10.01%\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding (Jan. 29, 2021) 9.33%\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that not too many are betting against this company.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n$RESN has been popping up on my twitter feed via some of the traders and investors I follow such as: [@LuoshengPeng](https://twitter.com/LuoshengPeng) and [@kkernttb](https://twitter.com/kkernttb) among others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what we see so far is that their sales are growing, they're exceeding their projections, meeting contractual agreements while working with an industry giant. The best part is, they have opted for an intellectual property licensing business model, in the manner of Qualcomm, ARM and others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n$RESN seems to still fly under the radar but has a good runaway to go for 2021.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this one! And how did I do on my first DD. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPOSITION: I'm long. 2500 @ $7.10 as of today, Feb10 2021.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPS: YES, I will be cross-posting this to other investment subs. NO, I'm not a pump and dumper, nor a professional trader. You can check my shitty post history.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE** SOME MORE INFO ON RF FILTERS...The proliferation of 4G LTE networks, the deployment of new 5G networks, and the pervasive nature of Wi-Fi are driving a dramatic increase in the number of RF bands that smartphones and other mobile devices must support. And with the coming of IoT, those bands will be more congested than ever! Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls. RF filters are nothing new, and have been a part of mobile devices since their creation with 1G phones and those old wireless handsets we had at home before the advent of cellular tech!\n\n &nbsp;\n\nWhat makes this unique is that 5G needs to be even more isolated from other bands to ensure signal reliability and strength. $RESN is at the forefront of this tech for 5G.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's a link explaining the congestion in RF bands, a bit physcis-y.. https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/semiconductors/article/21137042/resonant-resonators-fuel-highperformance-rf-filters-for-5g\n\n&nbps;\n\nAnd I JUST saw this Physics Phd dude post his analysis about $RESN's RF filter using XBAR/BAW technology: https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/semiconductors/article/21137042/resonant-resonators-fuel-highperformance-rf-filters-for-5g",
