I really think this is a great play, hopefully it over takes the 200EMA soon. Vortex and Stoch is low, RSI is consolidating. Good value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$AMGN - Gorgeous channel up right now, I really love it. Right at support a well, just broke the 200EMA which isn't great. All indicators are low, but a great value here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$CHRS - Tanked right into where you want it! Could be a tad lower, but it is a good value still. All indicators very low, and this is just a purely great price action play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$IAG  - Could be a smidge lower, but it looks really good here. Indicators look great, I really enjoy this value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$NGD  - Fantastic trend up looking great here. Support is right here, and so is the trendline up. All indicators are low, and it looks like a great pick up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$RARE - Support area is right here, and trend up is also right here. Give it another day or two, but this is a beautiful setup right here. Indicators are low, so reversal coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$RIDE - 200EMA bounce right in trend line and at support? Love it. Indicators are all super low, this is a great pick up right here - A1 setup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$SURF - 200EMA bounce. One of my favorite stocks to abuse, looking super good here. I just love it.",
