He had shifted his portfolio to be more focused on the traditional  high performers during economic booms. I didn't have the foresight to do that. \n\nI looked at the YTD performance of all the S&P500 components and realized my portfolio has hardly any of the top performers. While my portfolio definitely has a higher weight in growth stocks, I still had a car manufacturer, a retail stock, an airline, some sector ETFs and some other reopening plays. I felt I was decently diversified. But the huge blind spot in my portfolio happened to be with the highest performers YTD.\n\nCan't make myself buy oil stocks, but I ended up putting some money into an industrial ETF (I don't know enough about the industry to feel confident in any single stocks) and a Financials ETF. I also averaged down my cost basis in several of my tech stocks I'm confident will come back strong. This has all helped counterbalance my portfolio and the bleeding has been mitigated since shifting my portfolio.\n\nGotta be agile! Been a good lesson in (real) diversification. Hope you guys are learning and evolving as well.",
