Anyhow, maybe someone here can reassure me.\n\nI've gotten a bit more comfortable with basic options trading over the past 6 months. I still consider selling a put option a basic task but very important to add to the repertoire for setting up more complex strategies. I want to start getting more comfortable with this type of trade as well. I want to keep the first one small just to make sure I don't screw it up or lose a bunch of money. I'll outline the trade below and just want to make sure there's no huge potential for loss here.\n\nI want to own Palantir (PLTR) at $23.5, it is currently trading at $26. My assumption is that I can sell the put option (sell to open) contract for a strike price of $23.5 for whatever date I choose (looking short term just to start off - say April 1). If the price of PLTR drops to $23.5 at any point during that period and gets executed, I am assigned the shares at the strike price of $23.5 (minus the premium I receive so actually less than $23.5 overall). If it never hits the strike price of $23.5, the contract expires I get no shares but I collect the premium. Am I missing something on this that might cost me a bunch of money? I know that I need to ensure I have the capitol in my portfolio to cover the cost of the contract if it gets executed, that's not an issue. But my concern is my Brokerage states my maximum loss potential is $2,239 which scares me. I'm assuming that the $2,239 loss is actually just the cost for purchasing the shares minus the premium received, but that to me is not a loss I still own an underlying equity worth $2350 (i.e. no loss).  \n",
