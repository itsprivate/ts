  "selftext": "I saw RKT being discussed quite a lot on r/stocks  and most of the threads I read were bullish on it. As I want to diversify my tech-heavy portfolio , I put this stock in my watchlist and did some rough DD :\n\n1.  COVID-19 crisis prodded the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to 0\n2.  RKT is nation's largest mortgage originator \n3. Their app allows customers to get everything done on cellphone so more attractive to younger generation . \n4. No  loan officer involved so less cost.\n\nAll these factors make this stock appealing and yet  its performance has not been so impressive ever since IPO. I'm not from US nor am I fammiliar with US mortgage market ,  let alone use RKT's service , so there must be something I overlook  or misunderstand. Why do you think RKT did not live up to expectation and where do you see it in five years ?  Any thoughts would be highly appreciated !",
