Not posting in the GME related subs because they probably won't like the fact that I'm not holding.  I believe this is related to the broader topic of stocks and stock trading.  Not sure if this will be deleted.  Disclosure: I hold 0 GME currently.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna explain this because I think it's worth explaining, and you're free to your opinions on GME and on anything, but I am detecting some dickishness on your part and I think it deserves to be called out.\n\nGME was cool because it showed that retail investors can win at this game, too. So big hedge funds like Melvin Capital can hope to multiply their wealth by shorting a dying firm into the ground, yeah? But the people who are just trying to make ends meet working at a company like Gamestop or similar from 9-5 have no hope of ever participating in that kind of play. And in fact they often see their very livelihood threatened by these hedge funds and other financial entities.\n\nTake the case of 2008 for example. Wall Street banks can profit off of unethical practices, normal people can't. And when the music stops, not only do the Wall Street firms get bailed out, they also take down the whole Main Street economy with them.\n\nPeople are tired of Wall Street and the wealthy always having the upper hand. They almost always win, and most of the time they win big. When they don't win, they can't lose, because the government's there to bail them out.\n\nMy degree is in economics. I know the bailout was necessary to save the economy. But it doesn't change the fact that the common people are fed up with this dynamic. They are fed up with it, and they have every reason in the world to be. People's livelihoods were dramatically, dramatically effected by this sort of behavior.\n\nGME represented the first time that retail could win in a big way. And even then, they didn't win. Robinhood cut off the trading. But still, it was a major breakthrough. Average Joes showed that via social media the odds have been evened a bit. Now it's not just hedge funds and mega financial entities that can win at these big plays... retailers have a shot, too.\n\nSome people look at it is \"bringing the Hedgies down\", \"death to the 1%\", etc. I'm not necessarily part of that crowd. But no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're a retail investor, just an Average Joe, you can be proud of what happened with GME. It was a victory for us. It meant a leveling of the playing field, if only ever so slightly.\n\nI for one am happy that I profited on the long end of things. I really believed in what I was doing, thus why I bought in on the way up the first time, and continued holding. I had never invested in stocks before. But I soon realized that the moment had passed, and that losing money wasn't much of a way to make a statement. So on the way up the second time I cashed out and made small profits.\n\nIf you wanna short it, that's fine. Like I said, you're not making much of a statement by losing money. I for one wouldn't want to short it. I really believed in that movement, no matter how small or insignificant my contribution was. It may not have mattered in the grand scheme of things, but it mattered to *me*.\n\nBut still. You wanna short it? That's fine. But the part about it \"making you sick\". I think that's on you, man.",
