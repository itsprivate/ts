For example, I recently read a Reddit Post where the author said that they believe TSM will easily go to a price of $500-600. However, the market cap is already 591 billion meaning they expect they will be more valuable than Amazon or Apple. I am not saying this is not true, but market cap is extremely important to take into consideration.\n\nApple's current price is $121.26 and Enphase's price is $176.06. Does this mean Enphase is the more valuable company? No. \n\nA company with a smaller cap has more room to grow than companies with bigger market caps regardless of the price they trade at. For example, it is more feasible that a 1 billion dollar company grows 10X than a company with a market cap of 50 billion to grow to 500 billion. \n\nIf you think a stock is a good buy, don't become too fixated on the price and buy it. On the other hand, don' think a stock is a good deal because it is a low price. There could have been massive dilution.\n\nGood luck in picking your next winners!",
