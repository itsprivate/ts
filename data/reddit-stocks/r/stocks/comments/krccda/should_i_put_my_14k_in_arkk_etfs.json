Along with another 14k account that I have invested with mutual funds through Edward's Jones. I have a checking account, but this 14k is for emergency uses and I only pull out of it when contributing to my Roth if I don't want to pull from my checking. Should I instead split the 14k between ARKK ETF's and take out money from them whenever needed? Would this not be smart because of taxing purposes? I don't know. I feel like it could grow better instead of being in mutual funds. Any advice helps. Thanks!",
