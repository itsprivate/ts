  "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI've been seeing all these posts about shady accounts trying to hype Nokia etc. Dunno anything about that, but I feel like I should ship into this conversation. \n\nFirst of all, a few weeks ago, I made a bad decision (hindsight 20/20) and decided to sell my NOK shares. Didn't have a big position to begin with, but still. You can see the [screenshot of that transaction here](https://imgur.com/a/8Nd0PUH).  (It is in Finnish, but it says I sold 1150 shares at 3,18 on 8th of January).\n\nNow today, after some careful consideration, I decided to hop back in, with a bigger, 9k position. [Screen here](https://imgur.com/a/pxZiEhW). \n\nI'll tell you why. \n\nFirst of all, every Finn has an opinion about Nokia, and they're very sentimental and nostalgic about it.  The company made a lot of people rich and they hope it'll become one of the great ones someday. And they're willing to hang on through the toughest of times. I do not know how much of the hype on interest is made up and how much is real, but I'm sure many Finns will view the latest surge in the stock price as a positive and - I believe - will jump back in and go long. The company has been all over the local news yesterday and today, so the media is adding to the hype. \n\nSecond, I think the company has been undervalued for quite some time now. And I don't blame the investors. There was every reason to think that the company was done for. But now it genuinely looks like there is a meaningful change coming. It might take a few years, but the company has definitely renewed their strategy and is moving in the right direction. \n\nThird, the analysts seem to agree. In the past week at least 4 different analysts have upgraded their target price. Latest were banks Danske Bank to 4,30€ and Handelsbanken to 4,40€.\n\nTo sum it up, the hype might not last, but I genuinely feel the potential is there.",
