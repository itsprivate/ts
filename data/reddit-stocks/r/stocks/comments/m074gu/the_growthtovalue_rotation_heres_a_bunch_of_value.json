There are going to be a lot of fearful investors moving their money, and a lot of fund managers buying up value stocks to please their skittish customers. \n\nSo I started looking for stocks with a low P/E ratio and the highest StarMine scores. StarMine is a scoring system used on Fidelity and some other brokers which uses an aggregate of analyst ratings. In other words, these stocks are universally rated buy and a likely target of cautious investors, and their low P/E puts them into the value basket. I’m not trying to get complicated. I’m looking for undervalued stocks with mainstream surface appeal. \n\n(Important to note that I am not saying StarMine scores are an accurate ranking of stocks, but only that I'm using them a proxy for where mainstream money will go during this rotation.)\n\nThe first group is what I’ll call Value Boomer Bait:\n \n* StarMine Equity Score of 9.1 or higher\n* Consumer discretionary company with a household name  \n* P/E ratio below 18\n\nThis gives you four good leads:\n\n* WILLIAMS-SONOMA (WSM)\n* AUTONATION (AN)\n* JACK IN THE BOX (JACK)\n* 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (FLWS)\n\nTwo similar leads without household names are AMERICA'S CAR-MART (CRMT) and HAVERTY FURNITURE (HVT).\n\nThe second group of obvious value stocks I found are some undervalued recreational boating companies with steady growth. ONEWATER MARINE (ONEW) and MARINEMAX (HZO) are high-end boat retailers, both with a StarMine score of 9.7, both with a P/E ratio of 11.9, and both with steady growth that was unaffected by the market sell-off. You can also look at BRUNSWICK CORP (BC), a manufacturer of boat components, which has a StarMine score of 9.4 and a P/E of 19.3. \n\nA lot of people have been looking at homebuilding recently, so here’s the homebuilders with a StarMine Score of 9.1 or higher and a P/E below 12:\n\n* GREEN BRICK PARTNERS (GRBK)\n* CENTURY COMMUNITIES (CCS)\n* BEAZER HOMES USA (BZH)\n\nAnd finally, here is a list of the top StarMine Equity Score by each sector, so I’m guessing you’ll see inflows into each of these:\n\nComm. Serv.\n\n* 8.7 LUMN Lumen\n\nCons. Disc.\n\n* 10.0 ASO Academy\n\nCons. Stap.\n\n* 9.8 BG Bunge \n\nEnergy\n\n* 9.2 DVN Devon Energy\n\nFinancials\n\n* 10.0 SF Stifel Financial \n\nHealth Care\n\n* 9.8 HOLX Hologic \n\nIndustrials\n\n* 10.0 ATKR Atkore\n\nInfo. Tech.\n\n* 10.0 LOGI Logitech\n\nMaterials\n\n* 9.7 Tronox\n\nReal Estate\n\n* 9.8 IIPR Innovative Ind Properties\n\nUtilities\n\n* 8.7 AY Atlantica\n\nObviously this is just a starting point for capturing the mainstream money, but I think there are some good buys here if you want to add value stocks. Or you could throw a dart and pick any of about 30 financial stocks that are universally rated buy. My picks are: \n\n* ROYAL CANADIAN (RY, 9.4 StarMine, 11 P/E)\n* CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK (CM, 9.4 StarMine, 10 P/E)\n* ENSTAR GROUP (ESGR, 10.0 StarMine, 3 P/E)\n* VIRTU (VIRT, 9.9 StarMine, 5 P/E)\n\nI don't own any of these yet, but I'm going to do some more research tonight and pick a basket of them for Monday morning. Good luck everyone and happy hunting.",
