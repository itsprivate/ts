The name takes the first character of JAC's Chinese name and the second character of NIO's Chinese name.\n\nThe company plans to have a registered capital of 500 million yuan ($77 million ), with JAC contributing 51 percent and NIO 49 percent.\n\nThe company's board of directors will consist of five directors, three to be appointed by JAC and two by NIO. The chairman will be appointed by JAC and the vice chairman will be appointed by $NIO.\n\nThe joint venture will build a new ecology of \"advanced manufacturing + industrial internet\" with automation, networking and platform, relying on industrial internet and manufacturing management experience, JAC said.\n\nThe purpose of the joint venture is to integrate the advantages of JAC and NIO in manufacturing, production operation, quality control, supply chain management, to serve the manufacturing operation of products scientifically, JAC said.\n\nThe business scope of the joint venture includes manufacturing, R&D and sales of electric vehicles and components; supply chain management; technical consulting and personnel training related to intelligent electric vehicles.\n\nJAC emphasizes that the letter of intent for the joint venture is not legally binding and does not constitute an offer, and the two sides strive to agree and sign a formal agreement as soon as possible.\n\n# This is the latest move by NIO to try to enter the lower-priced EV market with a new brand, and it looks more promising than any previous moves.\n\nIn April 2017, NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Changan Automobile, planning to set up a joint venture to develop new products together. The agreement at the time noted that the cooperation was different from JAC NIO's OEM model.\n\nOn August 17, 2018, the joint venture company Changan NIO was officially settled in Nanjing Jiangning Development Zone, with William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO as chairman of Changan NIO and Li Wei, executive vice president of Changan Automobile, as vice chairman.\n\nIn December 2017, GAC Group and NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement, and in April 2018, GAC NIO was officially established.\n\nHowever, so far, Changan NIO has not yet presented any new vehicle plans or clear development plans.\n\n[Source](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/04/breaking-nio-jac-to-form-joint-venture/)",
