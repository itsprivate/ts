Until now everything was in the bank giving me nothing... Also I want to buy a house in the next years.\n\n- 85k in ACC Degiro Comission Free ETF's. ACC because how spanish taxes work:\n\n   - 72k in [IE00B4L5Y983](https://www.morningstar.es/es/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000MLIH) (Comission Free)\n   - 13k in [ETF IE00B4L5YC18](https://www.morningstar.es/es/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0000MLIC) (Comission Free)\n\n- 10k in 4 solid stocks companies: Stuff like SBUX, DIS, MSFT, AAPL\n\n- 5k money for stock opportunities but not coming late to the party. My first investment has been 35@16,90 in AMC (which I'm still holding...) so I have learnt a valuable lesson about volatile stuff. Although thanks to it I found out about investing instead of having 140k at my bank giving me 0 interest.\n\nAdditional questions: \n\n- Should I put a lump sum in ETF's as soon as I can or space it out (and try to catch some dips)?\n\n- Can Degiro comission ETF's be better for me than the CF ones if I do a lump sum?\n\nThanks a lot.",
