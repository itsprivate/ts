Looking ahead, market participants will focus on the upcoming Quarter 1 earnings report slated to be released in the next weeks. Big banks are kicking off the earnings season starting Wednesday premarket. \n\nAs earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.\n\nYear-to-date, the cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening sectors have broadly outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher last year. The first quarter of 2021 was defined by the rotation out of high-flying tech stocks and into companies poised to directly benefit from the reopening of the economy. However, now that Quarter 2 started, we are seeing the rotation back into growth and tech stocks, with mega-cap companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) driving the market to record levels. In our view, while we expect tech stocks to continue performing well, it is highly unlikely they replicate the outsized performance from 2020 and continue to look for opportunities in companies that were most affected by COVID and that are poised to benefit from the reopening of the economy. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note “The initial reopening of the economy will trigger a huge rebound in margins across sectors which have been hit hardest by the COVID crisis. The unprecedented surge in households' cash balances over the past year – mostly due to the enforced drop in spending on services, augmented by stimulus payments – represents a potential wave of demand, while supply is constrained by business failures.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US government posted a March budget deficit of $660 billion amid the recent wave of fiscal spending, a record high for the month.\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) jumped after the company paid a record anti-trust fine, with analysts calling the fine removal of overhang. \"Positively, Alibaba does not expect further investigations on this matter, and we believe the removal of this overhang could be a positive for shares,\" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler, who rates shares of Alibaba as a strong buy, wrote in a note Monday morning. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced Monday morning that it agreed to purchase artificial intelligence speech recognition company Nuance Communications (NUAN) in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, including Nuance's debt. The announcement confirmed earlier reporting of the deal over the weekend by Bloomberg. \n* Shares of United Airlines sank after the company provided a worse-than-expected outlook for upcoming Quarter 1 earnings.\n* Gamestop (GME) is reportedly searching for a new CEO. \n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 5% after the company raised revenue outlook for the upcoming earnings report.  \n* The virtual summit in the White House focusing on the global semiconductor shortage began today\n* Electric vehicle startup Rivian, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motor (F) said on Monday that South Korean manufacturer Samsung SDI Co Limited would supply battery cells for its vehicles.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* Alaska Air (ALK) target raised by Raymond James from $65 to $85 at Strong-Buy.
