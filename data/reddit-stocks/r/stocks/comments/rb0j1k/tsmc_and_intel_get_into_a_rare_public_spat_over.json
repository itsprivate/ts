He added that TSMC does not attack its “peers.” Previously, TSMC executives have almost always described Intel as a “customer” rather than a “peer,” as a show of respect.\n\n“It will be very negative for the United States to subsidize only American companies,” Liu said. “Unlike Intel, TSMC is very positive about non-U.S. chipmakers expanding capacity in America. It is a great thing. This shows our decision two years ago [to build a new fab in Arizona] is correct.” \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-12-07/tsmc-intel-trade-barbs-over-u-s-chipmaking-fully-charged",
