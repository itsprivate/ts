Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape & Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company’s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.
