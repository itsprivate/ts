Along with the broader group, direct beneficiaries with ties the infrastructure or earth-moving equipment will be, in order: **Commercial Metals** (NYSE:CMC), **Nucor** (NYSE:NUE), **Reliance Steel and Aluminum** (NYSE:RS), **Steel Dynamics** (NASDAQ:STLD), **Olympic Steel** (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and **Schnitzer Steel** (NASDAQ:SCHN).\n\n##**Diversified Industrial.** \nAnalyst Jeff Hammond thinks the entire group would benefit for fundamental and sentiment reasons.\n\n1. **Colfax** (NYSE:CFX), from welding, **Harsco** (NYSE:HSC), **Eaton** (NYSE:ETN) and **nVent Electric** (NYSE:NVT), both for EV chargers, **Helios Tech** (NASDAQ:HLIO), **Gates Industrial** (NYSE:GTES) should benefit in transportation.\n2. **Parker-Hannifin** (NYSE:PH), **ETN**, **NVT**, **Nordson** (NASDAQ:NDSN), **Altra Industrial Motion** (NASDAQ:AIMC), **Rexnord** (NYSE:RXN), **Regal Beloit** (NYSE:RBC), **CFX**, **Enerpac Tool Group** (NYSE:EPAC) will benefit in manufacturing.\n3. **Carrier Global** (NYSE:CARR), **Lennox International** (NYSE:LII), **Trane Technologies** (NYSE:TT), **Watsco** (NYSE:WSO), for HVAC, should benefit in housing.\n4. **CARR, LII, TT, WSO,** for ventilation upgrades, will benefit in schools spending.\n5. **CARR, LII, TT** should benefit from federal building upgrades.\n6. **ETN, Generac Holdings** (NYSE:GNRC) should benefit from alternative energy.\n\n##**Auto Suppliers.** \nAnalyst James Picariello says the plan is well targeted for the blueprints for mass EV adoption, which are \"strict and consistent emissions regulations, generous consumer tax incentives, and a determinable charging infrastructure buildout.\"\n\n1. **Aptiv** (NYSE:APTV) and **BorgWarner** (NYSE:BWA) lead EV supplier opportunities, followed by **Dana** (NYSE:DAN), **Meritor** (NYSE:MTOR), **Magna International** (NYSE:MGA) and **Lear** (NYSE:LEA), but the latter two would be disproportionately hit by higher corporate tax rates.\n2. **MTOR** and **DAN** will also benefit from the impact on truck and off-highway markets.\n\n##**Vertical Software.** \nAnalyst Jason Celino thinks the plan would \"accelerate digitization opportunities across the architecture and construction industry.\"\n\n1. **Bentley Systems** (NASDAQ:BSY) gets 60% of total revenue from infrastructure, so the plan could lead to \"meaningful multiyear tailwinds.\"\n2. **Autodesk** (NASDAQ:ADSK) exposure to infrastructure of 15-20% of revenue and the \"completion of its Innoyze acquisition, providing solutions for water infrastructure assets, gives us incremental confidence.\"\n3. **Trimble** (NASDAQ:TRMB) has 25-30% of revenue from infrastructure \"geospatial, construction, and civil engineering offerings are well positioned.\"\n\n##**Chemicals.** \nAnalyst Aleksey Yefremov highlights benefits for \"industrial coatings, polyurethanes, epoxy, PVC, and chlor-alkali.\"\n\n1. **Huntsman** (NYSE:HUN) will see higher end-market demand, with the most upside in polyurethanes.\n2. **Olin** (NYSE:OLN) is a pick as the \"proposed spending package laid out plans for manufacturing spend, a key end market for caustic soda. Industrial coatings and adhesives is also a major end market for the Epoxy segment.\"\n3. **Westlake Chemical** (NYSE:WLK) is \"a beneficiary of strong PVC, building products (mostly pipe), and chlor-alkali markets.\"\n4. **DuPont** (NYSE:DD) has the most compatible portfolio for the spending bill.\n5. **Albemarle** (NYSE:ALB), **Livent** (NYSE:LTHM) should benefit from a pickup in EV support.\n\n##**Communication Services.** \nAnalyst Brandon Nispel says the bill \"is positive for infrastructure providers (tower operators) and neutral to negative for network providers (wireless carriers and cable operators).\"\n\n1. **American Tower** (NYSE:AMT), **Crown Castle** (NYSE:CCI), **SBA Communications** (NASDAQ:SBAC) are picks in towers, which will be helped by improving investment in wireless networks.\n2. **Altice USA** (NYSE:ATUS), **Cable One** (NYSE:CABO), **Charter Communications** (NASDAQ:CHTR), **Comcast** (NASDAQ:CMCSA), **WildOpenWest** (NYSE:WOW) may see a hit to discretionary cash flow due to a higher corporate tax rate.\n3. **AT&T** (NYSE:T), **T-Mobile U.S.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Verizon** (NYSE:VZ) are the most at risk of a corporate tax rate hike, with T and VZ seeing incremental taxes of $1.5B to $2B.\n\n##**Entertainment and Video Games.** \nAnalyst Tyler Parker says the plan for bringing high-speed broadband to every American will help domestic online vide games\n\n1. **Activision** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts** (NASDAQ:EA), **Take-Two Interactive** (NASDAQ:TTWO) and **Ubisoft** (UBISFY) could see tailwinds.\n\n##**Semiconductors.** \nAnalysts John Vinh and Wes Twigg say \"expansion incentives would likely be a tailwind for semiconductor equipment demand while easing the capex burden on manufacturers.\"\n\n1. **Applied Materials** (NASDAQ:AMAT), **ASML** (NASDAQ:ASML), **Advanced Energy Industries** (NASDAQ:AEIS), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), **Lam Research** (NASDAQ:LRCX) and **Teradyne** (NASDAQ:TER) would benefit in equipment names.\n2. **Analog Devices** (NASDAQ:ADI), **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC), **Micron** (NASDAQ:MU), **ON Semiconductor** (NASDAQ:ON) and **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ:TXN) are picks among those with domestic manufacturing footprints.\n\n##**Utilities.** \nAnalyst Sophie Karp notes the majority of the impact on the sector would not come from direct spending, but from fiscal incentives.\n\n1. **American Electric Power** (NASDAQ:AEP), **Southern** (NYSE:SO), **Duke Energy** (NYSE:DUK), **Dominion Energy** (NYSE:D), **Entergy** (NYSE:ETR) and **Edison International** (NYSE:EIX) can benefit from incremental grid investment initiatives and electrifications trends from an EV tide that will \"lift all boats.\"\n2. **Eversource Energy** (NYSE:ES), **Avangrid** (NYSE:AGR), **Public Service Enterprise Group** (NYSE:PEG), **NextEra Energy** (NYSE:NEE), **Xcel Energy** (NASDAQ:XEL), **AEP**, **Sunrun** (NASDAQ:RUN), **Sunova Energy** (NYSE:NOVA) will be helped by the extension of the investment tax credit and the production tax credit further boosting commercial solar and wind.\n3. **Public Service Enterprise Group** (PEG), **Excelon** (NASDAQ:EXC) and **Energy Harbor** (OTCPK:ENGH) would benefit from any concrete federal program to support nuclear energy.\n4. **First Solar** (NASDAQ:FSLR) may get a boost if solar installers can bypass Chinese tariffs.\n\n##**Oil and Gas Exploration and Production.** \nAnalyst Leo Mariani says the plan \"is likely to have a bit of a long-term negative for traditional U.S. oil E&Ps if it accelerates the transition away from fossil fuels for transportation purposes, but we generally think that other variables that normally impact the price of oil over the next few years are much more likely to affect energy stocks as opposed to the impacts of this bill, which will take a healthy part of this decade and into the next to make a material impact.\"\n\n##**Life Science Tools.** \nAnalyst Paul Knight says \"a specific call-out of 'biotechnology' as a key technology investment is positive.\"",
