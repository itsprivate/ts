All that money so far has gone into very risky stocks and although I really like those companies, I’d like to start investing into ETFs. \n\nI’m looking for ETFs that have the most growth potential for the next 5-10 years and then I’ll look into moving it into even safer avenues. As I mentioned before I am newer to investing and recently learned about leveraged ETFs and I believe this is what I’m looking for. So far I’ve looked into TQQQ, UPRO and QLD but I’m definitely open to advice. \n\nI don’t know if ETFs commonly pay dividends but I’m looking for something that doesn’t pay dividends so I don’t need to worry about taxation. \n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: I’d like to mention that I would also probably like to eventually start selling covered calls on my shares once I start having increments of 100 owned, if that helps at all.",
