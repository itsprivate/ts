What I have noticed is that TLRY has been trading higher than it maybe should be given this conversion ratio.

If the 0.83 conversion were to take place now, every APHA share would be converted into 0.83 TLRY shares which would be worth ~$23.70.

These stocks follow similar trends too and have essentially been consistently trading around the same percentage with APHA always trading lower than 83% of TLRY.\n\nMy question is, shouldn’t the market adjust so that APHA gets closer to 83% of TLRY either by APHA going up independently of TLRY or TLRY going down independently of APHA. Otherwise am I missing something such as will the merger anyway reduce the stock price. Or perhaps since the merger is more than a month away this adjustment just hasn’t happened yet?\n\nI would think that since this company is expected to be the largest marijuana company in North America upon merging that APHA would seem to be the better buy than TLRY.",
