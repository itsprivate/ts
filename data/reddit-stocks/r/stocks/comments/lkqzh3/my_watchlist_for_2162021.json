Holding this support created by a gap well, and still basically in trend line support. RSI and Vortex are super low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$ARDX - Super beautiful channel up right above support areas. It is trying to push high volume. Right above the 50EMA as well. Stoch and Vortex low which is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$CAH  - this is a strong support, no real trendline here. It did break the 200EMA so keep that in mind. All indicators are low, so will this hold? Either way, very low risk play here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$EMP  - Great beginner play. Only 5-6% reward but very low risk as well. Great support area here. All indicators super low which is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$HLIT - Gorgeous channel up, but the 50EMA broke. 200 is near by, but we have a beautiful support line here too. Indicators low, so I think a reversal is near.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$MAS  - gorgeous channel right and up; it is showing higher lows. Indicators are fair, but the price action here is absolutely beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$WYY  - Beautiful new ascending triangle forming. Right at support and trend, and again the goal is to minimize risk, which we are doing here. Indicators are low, so I think this is another great play.",
