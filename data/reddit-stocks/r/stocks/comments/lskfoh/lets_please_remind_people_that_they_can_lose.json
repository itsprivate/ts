We also don't know if they are covered or naked calls.\n\nIt's clear that redditors money is not moving the needle and that the spike was caused either by covering shorts or call options being delta-hedged. In any case, don't be reassured by other people buying. Accept a squeeze like yesterday's can happen, but **it's completely out of your control or other redditors'. So TRADE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.**\n\nRight now WSB is *again* showcasing posts of people putting their life savings on GME near the top, and **not a single comment with a hard, concise, word of caution.**\n\nIt's just sad at this point. \n\n**I've got my 2 shares in**. Idgaf, I can hold. **But I might just as well sell at 150, 200, 300** and buy something nice for a member of my family with the free cash.

It's not worth your life savings and your loved ones wellbeing. What if there still is a lot to squeeze yet, but funds keep repeating the cycle of bringing the price down for weeks? Are these people putting their entire savings in GME going to hold until then? No. They will panic and cash out with a loss.\n\n**TL;DR: Only trade money that you can afford to lose.
