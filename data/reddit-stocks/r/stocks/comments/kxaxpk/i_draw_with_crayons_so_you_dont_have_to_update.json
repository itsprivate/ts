I executed on all of them except SFIX and CRSRS because both of them shot up hard. The rest I entered and either exited at 75% profit or I am still holding. I want to begin to move to at least 40% cash since the market is extended at these levels. I will probably be slightly more patient with some plays going forward. Think I might just add a couple more puts sold to open on PLTR. As a side note, looks like I broke that $100k barrier for good now. When I started this journey with you all 3 months ago I was only at $75k\n\n# Old Positions\n\n**ARCT:** even though I said I would hold until I was profitable I will be closing this. It will free up much more capital and allow me to make other trades now that it's closed.\n\n**FSLY + OSTK**: These are in my zones to close the positions and will do so by EOD today.\n\n**GME:** Currently holding $15 puts sold to open and they are still only 50% profit. Crazy how high the IV is that it's still giving good premiums for a put requiring a 60% drop in just 3 weeks. I want to sell more here, but I'm not sure about the risk/reward with how the stock is moving.\n\n# New positions from this week\n\n**JMIA:** This one rocketed up 15% the day after I sold puts which was great for me. They still have a few weeks to go so they aren't losing value that fast. I will hold through the 3-day weekend and re-evaluate next week.\n\n**COTY, FEYE, PLTR**: All 3 of these pretty much haven't moved, so I'm waiting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Positions screenshot](https://imgur.com/y8XX2l4)",
