I've never posted here, but  I've been following for about 6-7 months, and most of my picks came from the detailed posts I came across here. \nI started investing around this time last year as a recent unemployed college graduate (22 years old) putting in some of my Walmart paycheck every other week. Over the spring,I accepted a teaching job and have been able to increase my monthly contributions and have been loving the gains, although small in comparison to what I've seen, that I've been able to make.\nI know this was an extraordinary year, and I definitely shouldn't expect these kinds of returns yearly, but I'm eager to see how my portfolio performs in the future!\nSo thanks again everyone for all the thoughtful posts, advice, and DD! And good luck to you all!!",
