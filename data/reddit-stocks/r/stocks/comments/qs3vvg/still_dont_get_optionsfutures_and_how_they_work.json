Again, that's definitely not right because that would just be an infinite money glitch because you would always never take the option if it's going down and always take it if it goes up.\n\nFutures makes a little more sense because you have to oblige the contract. But then why wouldn't you just buy something normally? What's the benefit of buying at a set time?\n\nTL:DR, genuinely have no idea how options/futures work and what their point is, and I probably sound really dumb but if someone can explain in a way that makes sense I would really appreciate that, thanks!",
