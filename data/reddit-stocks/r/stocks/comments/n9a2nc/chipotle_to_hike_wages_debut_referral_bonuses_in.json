There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.\n\nChipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.\n\nAs the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.\n\nThe company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.\n\nThe pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.\n\nChipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/chipotle-to-hike-wages-debut-referral-bonuses-amid-tight-labor-market.html)",
