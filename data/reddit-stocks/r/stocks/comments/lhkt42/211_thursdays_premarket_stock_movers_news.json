Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record high close\n\n> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.\n\n> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.\n\n> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay “patiently accommodative” to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is “a long way” from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results\n\n> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday’s closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.\n\n> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber’s ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop\n\n> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray’s short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday’s premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO\n\n> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she’ll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That’s an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. House impeachment managers to continue their case against Trump\n\n> * House managers on Thursday are set to continue to lay out their case against former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial. Trump’s lawyers are expected to launch their defense by the end of the week. Chilling security video of last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, including scenes of rioters searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was introduced Wednesday as a key exhibit by Democratic lawmakers prosecuting the case for why Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/spT0oOh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yk3czfV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cp4ZO2h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qhUF3iO.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vaQAqc7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/as9MYPP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UHUQITx.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Whbh3P7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IdivVuT.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MCdjdGs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/FSAy7KM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/GLy06ZJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IFIF4ed.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/CcvSt3u.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8SjY5kH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/rfFbrv8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/VX52HqC.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/zBUkfG2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/nYUKURp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-pepsico-generac-tempur-sealy-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **PepsiCo (PEP)** – The beverage and snack giant beat estimates by a penny with adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share, and revenue was above estimates as well.
