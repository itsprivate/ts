Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.\n\nJohn Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”\n\n“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.\n\nThe machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.\n\n“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.\n\nThe commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.\n\nAfter the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children",
