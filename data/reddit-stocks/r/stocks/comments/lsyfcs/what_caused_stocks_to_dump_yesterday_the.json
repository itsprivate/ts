We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as \"rotation\" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. \n\nMonday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to \"unwind\" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. \n\nWe can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called \"whales\" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. \n\nYesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*\n\n[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)\n\n* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  \n\n> “It wasn’t an orderly selloff and certainly didn’t appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,” wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. \n\n* **\"Fundamental decoupling\" between low interest rates and a heating economy**\n\nBond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of \"maximum employment\" plans\n\n> The bond market’s divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve.
