I just opened a Fidelity account and I want to transfer to it so I don't have to worry anymore. I'm just concerned that I am going to mess up somewhere along the way or make an oversight and screw myself. Like I said, this is a lot of money for me, so I'm very tressed. Any and all help would be much appreciated. I can also only transfer full stocks so I will have to sell of any stock that is a percentage. I am extremely nervous for many reasons regarding this. If anyone has any insight about Cash App as a whole it would be much appreciated, thank you.",
