Since then it has been consolidating side ways. Even after delivering great 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1 results. Even in Q2 beside the revenue miss, their most profitable business AWS and Ad grew by good %. But we are now back to mid end of the consolidation.\n\nI own MSFT, AAPL and GOOG. But my position is half of what AMZN is, because I just love this company and feel like they have lot of room for growth with disruptive products Self driving cars (zoox), Internet Satellite (Project Kuiper), store automation, increasing amazon warehouse margin by more automation and less workforce and obviously continuing the AWS success. They are operating at huge scale if the new CEO focuses on efficiency it would be game changing.\n\nI am sort of looking for confirmation bias if I should still keep AMZN as my top holding, or slowly reduce the position. What are your bull and bear case for AMZN?",
