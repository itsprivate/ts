South Korea's Samsung is the only company to match TSMC in terms of semiconductor production.\n\nThe global shortage in semiconductors is affecting everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, and there is no obvious end in sight. This is great news for the likes of TSMC whose shares have risen 50% in a year. But Morningstar analysts still think the shares are undervalued. The Taiwanese company also has a wide economic moat because it could command higher prices and has a lower cost base than rivals.\n\nSo, are semiconductors companies good long term investments?
