They have a very loyal customer base and it’s very tempting to buy another apple product once you’ve become accustomed to one of them. Product line up is still relatively small so plenty of room to grow there too. IMO we could see 3t market cap easily this year assuming no catastrophic macro economic events. \n\nAmazon and Microsoft arguably have a better business model than apple.
