On Thursday JP Morgan sold $13 billion in bonds (largest ever bank deal), Bank of America broke that record today by selling $15 billion in bonds. Apparently Goldman Sachs also sold off a bunch of bonds, but I cant find the exact ammount. These banks are in great shape too, JP Morgan just reported its best quarter ever. \n\nThe articles are saying its to take advantage of low interest rates, but why are all the banks selling record breaking bonds back-to-back? Is there some new policy implementation that Im unaware of? The timing just seems really odd as theres no singular catalyst that I know of. Can someone with more knowledge ELI5 for me?",
