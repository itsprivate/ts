Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast a second-quarter adjusted loss of 54 cents a share.\n\nRevenue totalled $298 million, up 320% from a year ago and handily above analysts' estimates of $245.5 million. Monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 281% to 1.1 million.\n\n\"DraftKings had a particularly strong second quarter of 2021, maintaining our impressive financial performance while also advancing into new areas, such as media and NFTs,\" said DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins. \"We believe these expansion opportunities will enable us to further grow our customer base and generate additional revenues through cross-selling to our existing players.\" \n\nLooking ahead, DraftKings raised its fiscal 2021 revenue guidance to a range of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion from a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, \"... which equates to YoY growth of 88% to 100% and a 14% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance,\" the company said.\n\n[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/earnings/draftkings-dkng-stock-narrower-than-expected-loss-guidance-boost](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/earnings/draftkings-dkng-stock-narrower-than-expected-loss-guidance-boost)",
