I used to spend a lot on games and Uber because the income at that time was a lot for a kid, I earned about 1.6-1.8k USD a month based on the USD rates ten years ago. Still managed to save quite a bit, but I wished I could have saved more. When I got to 21 years old, I was pretty much set on a simple index fund portfolio of IWDA/EIMI (I have since switched to VWRA). I have some individual stocks investment but its never >20% of my entire portfolio, this is because I know for a fact that I won’t be able to tolerate downturns in the market and I’ll probably sell and take losses if it gets very bad. ( Years ago I bought TEVA after they got into a shitload of debt but was restructuring under new management, they were doing well until they had to pay settlements to all 50 states (i think) for price fixing drugs with other large pharma, sold at a loss, but fortunately it wasn’t much)\n\nHowever at that age I realised that it was more beneficial to revisit my spending habits as opposed to just putting money into ETFs every month. Here’s why.\n\nAssuming you have 50k invested growing at a rate of 7% per year with ETFs, that’s about $3500 profit. However, if you revise your spending habits and save an extra $300 a month, you would have saved $3600. When your net worth is little at the beginning, I believe that it is very important to check your spending habits for two reasons:\n\n1) You are probably very young (I’m 27, not old, but not super young), and financial literacy at a young age will enable you to get used to that habit for life, you will save money with very little difficulty once you get used to it.\n\n2) While it is great to DCA any excess money and it is highly encouraged, the fact is that a low starting capital isn’t going to snowball efficiently. 10% of 10k is just $1000. If you save more, you can invest more and let compounding interest (for ETFs) or whatever capital invested in individual stocks work harder for your money. \n\nFinancial literacy is not a side effect of wealth, it is the other way round.\n\nWealth is a side effect of financial literacy. \n\nYou don’t need a reason to save money.\n\nYou will also find yourself being happier when you understand the concept of having enough.\n\nI’m working as a flight attendant for several years, the income isn’t too bad, usually about 4k USD a month (for the last year, probably half but I work part-time elsewhere for now to sustain as much as I can, but the air travel industry has taken a hit I don’t expect to recover soon) and I usually throw 1.5k into ETFs and save the remainder as cash. Factoring in promotions to the highest rank will probably net me 6-8k a month as I go up the ladder, which I find entirely sufficient. I have many friends who are working in great jobs, but I work in a job that I love and I work about 85 hours on average per month pre covid. That’s about 10 days of work a month when you convert it to a 9-5 working cycle. I enjoy going out in different countries and sightseeing, as well as doing a great deal of reading (mainly history and economics). I could find a higher paying job with my education, but I’m able to do this because I believe that I have enough in my life. Everything else is a bonus. \n\nPlease stay mentally healthy and I wish you guys all the best in your investing path, be it active or passive investors.\n\nEdit: I understand that this isn’t about stocks, but I believe it is important as it is relevant to potential returns of stocks when you also make your savings more efficient, it’s at least more useful that the daily reminder to hold during a red day and to go out for a walk.",
