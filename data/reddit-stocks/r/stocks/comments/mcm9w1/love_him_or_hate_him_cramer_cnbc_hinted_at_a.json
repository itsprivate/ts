He also promoted AMD a lot which many people love and are super long on...\n\nAnyways i was listening to Mad Money from Tuesday 3/23/2021 and it was very subtle but i noticed he mentioned that there will be a rotation back to tech stocks soon. Cramer mentioned around easter is when things rally. I am curious to see what happens \n\nIn addition today and yesterday listening to Fast Money/ Squak i noticed they mentioned the same thing... but in a different way. They mentioned that PE's for \"value\" are slowly  reaching PE's of \"tech\" and that with that people are going to jump back into the tech stocks thinking they are getting a deal now which will effectively cause a rotation back to tech. \n\nI found this interesting because in the previous weeks they've been promoting value value value and ive been waiting for the hint that we are rotating back. \n\nWhat are everyone thoughts?",
