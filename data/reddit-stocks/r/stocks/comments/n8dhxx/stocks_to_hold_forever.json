I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.\n\nMy main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:\n\n- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN\n\nWhen choosing stocks I didn’t really look through the financial sheets. I simply bought companies that looked relatively stable and well known anywhere I go. Let me know what you think!",
