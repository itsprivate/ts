I swear I have never seen anything even close to this!\n\nBack in the late 90s and even when the Nasdaq crashed in March of 2000, you would have a handful of stocks down 10-20% in a single day. You may have a handful of stocks with volume over 10 million.. Check the history! Now you have stocks up 200% and down the next day 50% I cant mention the ticker here or I will get banned. But there are many stocks that go down 15-20% on nothing! SLQT went down 50% on a slight miss Thursday!   \n\n\nI feel now more than ever there are gamblers everywhere. Everyone piles on on positive or negative news quickly...because of social media.. We know.....\n\nSo my question is, has it changed the way you trade/invest and how?   \n\n\nFor myself I am quickly adapting........ I am actually trading more momentum stocks than I ever traded before.. Companies with horrible financials... which is hard for me, but we have to adapt or get killed on SLQT??\n\nPlease share ideas, I am trying to adapt as quickly as possible too!",
