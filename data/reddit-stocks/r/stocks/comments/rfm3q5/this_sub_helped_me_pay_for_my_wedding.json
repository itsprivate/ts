This sub has a lot of great information, and I  learned about SPY and SPLG. I put my money in there, and let it sit for over a year, even through the covid panic. (I got in at around 330, when covid came and SPY dropped to 220 I was panicking, but I didn't sell.)\n\nNow, a year later, I made a 35% return. I'm cashing out to now, but I'll be back. Just wanted to say thanks, and here's any advice I'd give to anyone who's in a similar situation where they have a big expense coming in about a year.\n\n1. Don't put the money in an IRA, keep it in a cash account. \n2. Buy SPY, re-invest dividends, and live your life. \n\nI've also lost some money, not a lot, but enough to learn my lesson, in trying to beat the market. The average investor, someone like me (and most likely you), isn't able to find where the market is inefficient. The market as a whole is smarter than any individual investor.  And the time you spend trying to find the stock that will help you beat the market is time most likely wasted. You'll never get that time back, and when you finally picked your stock, you're more likely than not would have been better off just investing in SPY. \n\nTL;DR, buy SPY till ya die",
