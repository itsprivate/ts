What are your thoughts on the state of the housing market over the next two years? How bad of a hit do you expect stocks/housing to take when rates eventually go up. \n\nI understand this all speculation and no one knows what will happen, just curious to see if anyone has any opinions and why, based on what you’re seeing.\n\nI personally believe stocks will keep going up with a few corrections but no big crash. I think the big one will happen within the next 5-10 years due to a financial crisis. As for the housing frenzy, I believe that will burn out in a couple years and drive prices down ~20%.\n\nYour thoughts?",
