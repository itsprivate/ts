I slowly grew my portfolio to around 8,000$ and had $1000 cash saved up. I had a strategy of dividend stock investing with some growth stocks in there. \n\nFast foward to Jan 2021 and I was addicted to the stockmarket. My friend told me to learn about options and debit spreads and all that good stuff. I started making a ton of money with options (because of state of the market before mid-febuary). I grew my portfolio to around 15,000. I had no guidance I was just learning as I went. \n\nWell, since I did not realize the downside of options, I was heavily leveraged in options so my portfolio over the last month has basically evaporated. Im down to 4,000 dollars now, and I know I should just construct a good portfolio with risk taken into consideration, but at this point, I feel so set back that I am discouraged to just live my life with some safe stocks and continue to add money over time. \n\nBasically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. \n\nAlso I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, and now I feel like that goal is 10x farther than it was in Feb. \n\nAny advice would be very appreciated.",
