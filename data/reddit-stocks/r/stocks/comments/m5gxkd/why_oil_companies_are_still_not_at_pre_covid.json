Although it’s approximately only 33% of the pre-covid dividend, they have been paying dividends throughout the entirety of 2020, meaning that they were still profitable. A quick look in their figures ([https://www.shell.com/investors/investor-presentations/2021-investor-presentations/fourth-quarter-2020-interim-results-presentations.html](https://www.shell.com/investors/investor-presentations/2021-investor-presentations/fourth-quarter-2020-interim-results-presentations.html))  shows that although their free cash flow and earning decreased, they still made a net profit of $5 billion in 2020. And they have decreased their debt from $79 billion to $75 billion.\n\nWhere in the recent months the prices of many stocks have skyrocketed, the oil stocks only have seen small price rises, following the price of crude oil. Royal Dutch Shell is still 30% down in price compared to pre-covid times. These companies seem to have barely, if all have profited from the influx. Why is this? \n\n**My opinion:** \n\nThe investors that have joined the market in the last year, are mostly idealists. Investing in futuristic, clean companies that “will improve the world”. Besides that, the aircraft industry is still no where near what it used to be, but once covid-restrictions start to be lifted, the aircraft industry will return inevitably. I feel like it’s mostly an image problem of these companies, they’re seen as old-fashioned, not hip and as oil companies. That last part couldn’t be less true. The example I have used Royal Dutch Shell, as well as many other companies that have their origins in oil, have been focussing on cleaner energy for a long while now. Royal Dutch Shell is working on hydrogen, solar power, wind energy and many other forms of clean energy. When the time comes that oil will be used less, they can smoothly transition into clean energy and use their advantage of the market position and experience they possess.  Let me know what you guys think!\n\nDisclaimer: I am in the position of some Royal Dutch Shell, so my opinion may not be completely unbiased, but I bought the stock based on some of the opinions/facts I have expressed in this piece.",
