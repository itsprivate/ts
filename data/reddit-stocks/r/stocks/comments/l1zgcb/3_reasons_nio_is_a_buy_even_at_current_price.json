The $ 57 level is not a random number, it was a previous resistance ( Jan 8) and according to the principal of polarity, it is supposed to work as a support now, and it seems this is exactly what [NIO ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-NIO/)is doing.  Strong support at the $57 level all week so far. \n\n1) lets start with something Juicy.    Call it a rumor if you want but NIO is building a second factory and will be working at lightspeed.  China has a huge workforce that works around the clock.  I know first hand that Countries such as Israel and UAE Dubai they hire Chinese construction firms because they get the job done the fastest efficiently.   China built hospitals from the ground up in 10 days during the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan.  Overnight Highway improvements is not unusual for them.

The new base construction site is located in the section of Jiangnan Road, Economic Development Zone, Hefei City. According to the 60-day planned construction period shown in the tender document, it is expected that the second factory of Jianghuai Weilai will be completed and put into production within this year.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base has just been selected as the 2020 Anhui Smart Factory. The Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base, which started in October 2016, was completed in one year and three months, and delivered more than 10,000 units that year. As of November 2020, nearly 80,000 units of ES8 and ES6 models have been delivered. EC6 sales have continued to increase since mass production and delivery started in September. With the launch of ET7, the construction of the second factory also prepares for future sales growth.\n\n1-2) Second to this Great news The current JAC factory is expanding to meet demands and future growth.  Really exciting stuff like a test track and an energy centre and sewage treatment station which sounds like they will make the factory as environmentally conscious as possible.  Basically every stage of production is getting a boost from painting workshop to press and welding.  Project expected to complete in 1 year, total size of upgraded facility is over 270,000m2 of building area.  \n\n[https://www.12369zb.com/view/159/5a\\_3GXcBzXGIkQ62BOD8](https://www.12369zb.com/view/159/5a_3GXcBzXGIkQ62BOD8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) NIO is ready for sales in Europe earlier than expected, per this Dutch website which is an EV auto sales and leasing company in the Netherlands.  It says NIO will be available in the second half of 2021.  Does not mention anything about BaaS in europe but says they are curious.

Investors can convert into equity in 2025 or NIO can pay back the debt.  these big investors are bullish on NIO and the rate for conversion for notes to equity (NIO ADS Stock) is around $93.06.  What this means is these big investors that have done more DD than is available to the public are confident NIO will hit the $100 price in the near future.  \n\nWith all that mentioned I feel the next delivery report and earnings will take NIO to new ATH.  Next earnings is expected early March for the period ending Dec 2020.",
