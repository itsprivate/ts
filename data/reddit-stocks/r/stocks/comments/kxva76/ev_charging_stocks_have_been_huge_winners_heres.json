Both stocks are up more than 200% since I first purchased them. \n\nHere is a third name you can add to your list of \"EV charging station stocks to buy.\" It's a longtime EV charging industry leader that is well-positioned to leverage its leading tech portfolio and network effects to dominate the European EV charging market in the 2020s. \n\n## The Undisputed Leader of EV Charging in Europe \n\nWhile Blink Charging and ChargePoint are battling each other for North American EV charging market supremacy, a $3.3 billion Netherlands-based company by the name of **EVBox** is already dominating the European EV charging market all on its own. \n\nThe company – which is going public through a merger with blank-check company **TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp.** (**TPGY**) – has installed over 190,000 charging ports all across Europe, from Spain (3,000 ports delivered) to Germany (40,000 ports delivered) to the UK (7,000 ports delivered) to the Nordics (10,000 ports delivered). \n\nCurrently, there are 72,000 active EVBox charging ports in Europe – which is a big enough base to give the company *over 25% share* of the EV charging station market in Europe. \n\nMake no mistake. **EVBox is the undisputed leader of EV charging in Europe.**\n\nPerhaps more importantly, EVBox is in a ***position of strength*** to defend its market leadership position over the next decade. \n\nThere are two big things here. \n\n***One*****, EVBox's existing widespread charging infrastructure will enable network effects.** \n\nEVBox already counts multiple big companies as customers – such as Avis, McDonald's, IKEA, and Amazon. The company should be able to leverage this huge customer base to keep winning more corporate contracts. After all, if I'm a CEO and I'm looking for EV charging solutions, I'm most likely going to choose the service that everyone else is choosing. \n\nIn Europe, that solution is EVBox. \n\n***Second*****, EVBox's new line-up of ultra-fast chargers underscores the company's technology leadership.** \n\nAbout a year ago, EVBox introduced its new fast charger EVBox Troniq 100 and a redesign of its ultra-fast charger Ultroniq. The EVBox Troniq provides 100 kW charging, while the Ultroniq provides 350 kW charging. Those numbers may seem intangible, but for context, most commercial and residential chargers provide a fraction of that charge. \n\nThe result? EVBox's top-of-the-line Ultroniq chargers can fully recharge most EVs (250 miles of range) in just 15 minutes. \n\nNet net, EVBox isn't just Europe's leading EV charging company today. Rather, thanks to network effects and technology advantages, ***EVBox projects to remain Europe's leading EV charging company for the foreseeable future***. \n\nThat's a big deal, because Europe is on the cutting edge of the EV Revolution. Pretty much every major country in Europe has a national EV incentive in-place, while most plan to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2025 (Norway), 2030 (Britain, Sweden, and Denmark), or 2040 (France). \n\nSo, the EV Revolution in Europe will zoom into hypergrowth gear over the next decade. As it does, Europe's EV charging infrastructure will expand dramatically from just 250,000 charging ports in 2020, to millions of charging ports by 2030. EVBox will lean into network effects and technical advantages to similarly grow its charging network by several hundred percent. \n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that management is targeting *60%-plus* annualized revenue growth into 2023, and *50%-plus* annualized revenue growth thereafter. \n\nGiven the hypergrowth backdrop, those growth targets seem entirely doable. \n\nIf the company does hit those growth targets, then my numbers suggest that this is a **$10-plus billion company in the making**. \n\nSo… with the market cap down around $3 billion today… it may be worth taking a good hard look at EVBox stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompany Name **TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp.**\n\nTicker Symbol **TPGY** \n\nShare Price **$24.17**\n\nCurrent Market Value **$1 Billion**",
