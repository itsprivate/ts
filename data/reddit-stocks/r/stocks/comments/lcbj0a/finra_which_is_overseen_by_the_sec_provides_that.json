S3 Partners was, to many people, a highly trusted source of information.\n\nHowever, information thrown to the side--with perhaps less popularity--is FINRA'S providence on GME's short interest, being 226%. I know many of the new members of this subreddit are unsure about where to get information or which info is misinformed and which isn't, however I believe I'd put my trust in the SEC -- part of the governmental body -- over a firm, S3 partners.\n\nTo some, I know this is not new news but it's assuring to have information which is reliable in these times strewn with misinformation.\n\n**What does this tell us?**\n\nPrior to the initial squeeze, the short interest to GameStop was 144%. The data provided by FINRA shows that shorts have doubled down on their position and to a greater extent, at that.\n\nIf you still like this stock, I thought this would be useful information. \n\nBut please, correct me if I'm wrong.",
