Expanding data centers allows cloud providers to boost their capacity in certain countries or regions.\n\nAlibaba also launched a cloud-based livestreaming product designed for online shopping. It will allow e-commerce players to launch a live stream shopping feature on their websites or apps that are hosted on Alibaba’s cloud.\n\nLivestream shopping usually involves a host talking about products that customers can buy directly via the live broadcast. It has become very popular in China and is growing in other parts of Asia.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce firm hopes that such a product can help it stand out from U.S. rivals including Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud market.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Alibaba was the biggest public cloud market vendor at the end of 2020 with a 19.2% share, according to IDC, boosted by success in China. Amazon was second with a 10.5% share.\n\nHowever, in the global market, Alibaba still trails Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\n\nAlibaba’s cloud announcements come after it reported its first net loss as a public company in the January to March quarter. The company was hit with a massive $2.8 billion fine as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation by Chinese authorities.\n\nMaggie Wu, Alibaba’s CFO, said the company would invest “incremental profits and additional capital” in “new businesses and key strategic areas” in its current fiscal year.\n\nIn China, Alibaba faces growing competition from other technology giants including Huawei and Tencent which more recently have stepped up their cloud computing investments.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/alibaba-cloud-expands-products-with-livestream-shopping-data-centers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/alibaba-cloud-expands-products-with-livestream-shopping-data-centers.html)",
