I am, of  course, not looking  to make $1000 off of this $100 initial budget, but  seeing any profit  would motivate oneself to invest more in the future. I  was thinking of  investing in popular airlines I could get my hands on,  as with the new COVID variant, these businesses are likely to be worth  much less. So, thoughts on this?
