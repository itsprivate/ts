I'm now pushing margin limits and need some expert advice. What to cut.\n\nMy biggest bag holders in order are...\n\nDKNG (-23% down, $54.89 CPS)\nPLTR (-19% down, $23.11 CPS) \nSFT (-15% down, $9.16 CPS) \nPINS (-13% down, $65.95 CPS)\n\nDKNG is 55% holding, PINS is 22%, PLTR 8%, SFT 5%\n\nNeedless to say, DKNG is the problem. I'm holding a lot and it's down the most. I used to believe in the stock, but now I don't know what do believe.\n\nSo my question is...\n\nDo I just cut the cord and drop dkng before it drops to $20-25. Do I cut PINS? I can get rid of PLTR AND SFT but that won't help my margin deficit much.\n\nOr do I continue what I've been doing and shaving 10 shares at a time off either dkng or pins when margin gets close to max and just hope this crash stops soon?\n\nSerious suggestions please. No lectures. I know my mistakes. I just need to figure out the best way to mitigate my losses.\n\nNote - I don't need this money right now. I have another non-margin account that I never look at because I have all the time in the world for the stocks to rebound. But I'm racing against margin on this one so I'm wondering the best way to handle it. Thanks",
