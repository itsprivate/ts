I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.\n\n**Here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**\n\n* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks.\n* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light DD I run before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out.\n\n**Enough said, here’s the list!**\n\n**TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp. (TPGY) - +834%**\n\nMarket Cap: 1b\n\nEVBox, the undisputed leader of EV charging in Europe is going public through a merger with blank-check company TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp.\n\nReasoning: The company has installed over 190,000 charging ports all across Europe, from Spain (3,000 ports delivered) to Germany (40,000 ports delivered) to the UK (7,000 ports delivered) to the Nordics (10,000 ports delivered). EVBox already counts multiple big companies as customers – such as Avis, McDonald’s, IKEA, and Amazon. Kristof Vereenooghe, President and CEO, will present on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, at the 23rd Annual ICR Conference. EVBox is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by late Q1 2021.\n\n**Precision BioSciences, Inc. (DTIL) - +546%**\n\nMarket Cap: 635,5m\n\nPrecision BioSciences, Inc., a genome editing company, develops therapeutic products in the United States. It offers ARCUS, a genome-editing platform to cure cancers and genetic disorders.\n\nReasoning: Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, ARCUS, which allows for gene editing free of patents and licenses. Compared to CRISPR, ARCUS uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. They recently signed strategic partnerships with high profile companies, such as Eli Lilly in Nov. 2020. Check out this [thorough DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from fellow r/stocks member, u/kotsumu to learn more.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I do not currently own any shares in DTIL. I own shares in TPGY.\n\n**Due to the nature of this sub, I wasn’t able to share all the picks my program surfaced this week. If you want to learn more about them, feel free to check out my sub :)**\n\nIf you guys found these insights useful and/or have any questions/feedback, please let me know! Always appreciated :)",
