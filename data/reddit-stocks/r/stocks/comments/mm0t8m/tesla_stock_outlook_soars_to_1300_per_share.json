Bullish analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush, who boosted his outlook on Tesla stock to “Outperform” from a “Hold” rating following the Q1 figures, believes that the stock could cross the $1,300 mark in the coming months, especially if Presiden Joe Biden’s planned EV tax credit is pushed through. Wedbush sources indicate that the previously thought $7,000 credit could be increased to $10,000, further incentivizing car buyers to purchase electric powertrains instead of gas-powered ones.\n\nhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-stock-1300-per-share-biden-10k-ev-credit/",
