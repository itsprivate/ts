I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, articles on why this stock is overvalued at 18 price to sales ratio which implies at least 20-25% sales growth (sales growth 6-9x) for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, (because of its unprofitable low margin,no moat, slowing growth business) is trading only 17 billion marketcap more for postmates, uber eats and most dominant ride haling service.(63 vs 80 bil)\n\nWith earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but instead as of writing this post it is up 1.5% while airbnb is down on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1.8% as of writing this, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either.\n\nSo why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company) Yet, despite the earnings miss, analysts kept upgrading the price targets for this stock today yet they never explain why they upgraded doordash.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (i enjoy reading opinions on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) Alot of stocks that I believe to have positive sentiment isn't really moving higher, like sofi, disney, shift, alibaba, amazon while stocks that I see have more negative sentiment on youtube/reddit like doordash, carvana, zoom are performing relatively better?\n\nIn short, I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash and why doordash went up on earnings while most stocks went down on earnings (like sofi, ttcf, which is consider to be reasonable valuation but fell 15%)",
