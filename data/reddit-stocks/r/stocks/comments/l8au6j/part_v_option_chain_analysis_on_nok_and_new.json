On Sunday night I'll be making another post that will cover a much broader range of data to prepare for the week. The objective today is to get a general idea of what's going on.\n\nHere are the aggregate numbers for the most popular NTM/OTM options -\n\n|Type|Strike Price|Volume|Covered Calls Volume|Open Interest|Open Interest Change (24hr)|Open Interest % LEAPS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Call|$5|302,914|302,914|750,280|164.36%|43.01%|\n|Call|$7|178,382|178,382|650,039|N/A|51.57%|\n|Call|$10|198,960|198,960|727,640|N/A|41.71%|\n|Put|$5|37,384|N/A|216,167|108.53%|50.04%|\n|Put|$7|10,764|N/A|84,215|N/A|64.70%|\n|Put|$10|1,469|N/A|7,935|N/A|53.79%|\n\n ^(What is LEAPS?) [^(Long Term Equity Anticipation Security)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp) \n\nHere are the aggregate numbers for LEAPS -\n\n|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Call LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|961,418|85.21%|\n|Put LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|166,915|14.79%|\n\nHere are the aggregate numbers for Short Term Options -\n\n|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Short Term Calls|($5, $7, $10)|1,166,541|89.19%|\n|Short Term Puts|($5, $7, $10)|141,402|10.81%|\n\n^(Short Term Options are option contracts that expire in less than 12 months. In this case, the dates range from 29 January  to 16 July.)\n\nWhat we can learn from these numbers -\n\n1. Long term market sentiment for $NOK is *extremely* bullish. **85.21% of LEAPS options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7 and $10 over the next 12+ months.**\n2. Short term market sentiment is also *extremely* high. **89.19% of short term options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7, and $10 over the next 6 months.**\n3. There is still a relatively high volume of Put Options at $5, which may be part of the reason we see such high volatility around that price. Beyond $5, the ratio of Puts to Calls gets slimmer, which will likely lead to better stability as prices rises.\n4. Today's option volume was very high for Calls, and 100% of those Calls were covered. I wouldn't expect much gamma ramping (sudden upward jumps in price) as we go forward.\n5. Trade volume of shares was \\~350 million today. This is significantly lower than the weekly highs which exceeded 1 billion. This is likely why we saw only small movements. There were also quite a few sell-offs as the price reached a high of $5.22.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Nokia's Growing Business\n\nI'll keep this section short and sweet like I promised. All of these links come from [Nokia's Investor Relations News](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-and-stock-exchange-releases/).\n\nHere is Nokia's [Financial Calendar](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/22/nokia-corporation-financial-calendar-for-2021/). This is good stuff to keep track of if you are investing for the long haul.\n\nI'm just gonna list off a handful of big things that have occurred so far in January 2021 -\n\n* [Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/)\n* [Nokia Shanghai Bell to deploy next-generation network for Airport Authority Hong Kong](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-shanghai-bell-to-deploy-next-generation-network-for-airport-authority-hong-kong/)\n* [Nokia supports T-Mobile 5G evolution with five-year expansion deal](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/)\n* [Google Cloud, Nokia partner to accelerate cloud-native 5G readiness for communication service providers](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/google-cloud-nokia-partner-to-accelerate-cloud-native-5g-readiness-for-communication-service-providers/)\n* [Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-selected-for-us-federal-5g-cybersecurity-project/)\n* [Nokia and Mobily pilot world’s first 4G and 5G Fixed Wireless Access network slicing](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/20/nokia-and-mobily-pilot-worlds-first-4g-and-5g-fixed-wireless-access-network-slicing/)\n* [Nokia’s comprehensive C-Band portfolio ready for 5G build-out in U.S.](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/26/nokias-comprehensive-c-band-portfolio-ready-for-5g-build-out-in-us/)\n\nThe list goes on and on. There is *so much more* that isn't listed here. A lot of these new developments will start taking effect in Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, which can lead to major growth.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Finances Summary\n\nFor a full look at the finances and a comparison with Qualcomm and Ericsson, check out [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/). I'm just gonna summarize what was said over there.\n\n||$NOK Data (Converted to USD)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Book Value| $47.43 Billion|\n|Total Debt| $6.43 Billion |\n|Repayment of Debt| $542 Million |\n|Free Cash Flow| $2.35 Billion |\n|Net Revenue TTM| $890 Million |\n|Operating Income| $2.09 Billion |\n|Market Value|**\\~$24 Billion**|\n\nIn Part III we did a comparison between Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ericsson. Based on the numbers, it's pretty apparent how undervalued Nokia is compared to the competition - both of whom boast very similar finances. I again urge you to read [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/) on the finances for a better explanation.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMarket sentiment for $NOK is extremely high as we get ready to move into earnings week. Trade volume of shares has gone down, while option volume and open interest has trended upwards. \n\nFinancial data and press releases from Nokia indicate that the company is expecting to perform very well in the long term, with an abundance of new business coming in.\n\nI would again encourage you to read my other posts. They all include TL;DRs for the lazy.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Disclaimer and my Holdings -\n\nI currently own 10 of [these bad boys](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000). Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I'll be holding these for a while 🚀.\n\nIf you see anything wrong or something that should be changed, please let me know! I learn a lot from you guys as well.\n\n*I am not a CFA or any of that, just a curious investor who likes numbers, so this is meant to be an informative post and not a recommendation.*",
