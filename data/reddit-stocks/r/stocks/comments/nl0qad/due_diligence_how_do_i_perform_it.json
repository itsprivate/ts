This isn't financial advice, its just my personal process and style.\n\n# Profile: Is this company real?\n\n1. Website\n2. Address, Google Maps of HQ\n3. LinkedIn\n4. Wikipedia\n5. Social Media Accounts\n6. News Articles\n7. Key Executives\n\n# Financials:\n\n1. Look through the latest **income, balance sheet and cash flow statements**\n2. Calculate **YoY and QoQ** **growth** for at least 10 years (or less if the company is young) for each of the 3 financial statements\n3. Calculate different **valuation ratios and metrics** to see how they **stack up against their competitors**\n4. Look through **Analyst** Estimates, **Investment Bank** ratings and **DCF** figures\n\n# Documents:\n\n1. Read through recent **earnings call transcripts** to get a feel for how executives communicate and how honest they have been in the past quarters.\n2. **SEC Filings**: Read through proxies, prospectuses and more to get a full picture.\n\n# Insider Activity:\n\n1. Find out how many I**nsider Buys and Sales** have been made in the past 6 months.\n2. Look into who these insiders are, what they're role and functions are within the company.\n\n# Ownership:\n\n1. Find out which **Mutual Funds, ETFs and Hedge Funds** own the stock, how much of it and when they last bought/sold shares.\n\n# Social Sentiment:\n\n1. Scan through **Reddit, Twitter, Facebook Groups** for ticker/company mentions to see if the conversation is bullish or bearish. Beware, this can be misleading due to spam and trolling.\n2. **Google Keyword Research:**  This is especially useful if the company provides a consumer product or  service, I like to find out how often its mentioned and find any spikes  in online searches.\n\n# Future:\n\n1. What products and services are planned for the future?\n2. What are the industry/sectors innovations, needs and wants?\n3. What are competitors developing and are planning on releasing?\n4. What markets is the company looking to penetrate?\n5. What cultural/societal shifts and trends might effect the companies roadmap?\n\n# Price:\n\n1. I look for **price dips/spikes** and then look into what was going on during that period to see **what may have effected or caused them.**\n\n**So,  this is part of my process, some of it may suit your style, some wont.  I'd love to hear your feedback and it would be great if you all can  share your process!**",
