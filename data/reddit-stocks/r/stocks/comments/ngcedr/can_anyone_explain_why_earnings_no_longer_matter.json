It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)\n\nI know the argument is \"ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn\". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.\n\nLet's look at todays winners;\n\nAdvaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest\n\nMosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.\n\nLifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;\n\n**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**\n\nSo what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.\n\nTo end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.\n\nSo, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.\n\nI'm losing (lost tbh) all faith in the market and it feels more and more like a (rigged) casino every day now.",
