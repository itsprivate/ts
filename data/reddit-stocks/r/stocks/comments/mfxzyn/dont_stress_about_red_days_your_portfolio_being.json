Some people clearly haven't been investing for a longer period of time (neither have I) and others just don't deal well with the bad days. \n\nMy advice is this: during red periods take a look at your investments and see if anything about the company has changed since you started investing. If there is no significant change why would you sell now?\n\nSecond, if you have cash on hand try to incrementally buy shares of your highest conviction stocks or buy those who you think have been hit hardest. \n\nThird, think about the overall state of your portfolio. If it is too focused on one particular section, then consider broadening out your portfolio to different ones so you mitigate risk if you are not comfortable with the current volatility of your portfolio.\n\nThe final piece of advice is to just not stare at the graphs everday if you can't handle looking at the red candles. If you are like me and you are investing for the long-term why would you need to look at the graphs every single day?\nJust grab the stock chart of any stock for a 5 year period and look at the peaks and downturns in stock price. Some stocks lose like 30 percent from one peak before doubling in price compared to that peak and stockholders who held through that downturn eventually got rewarded for their patience. This doesn't mean that every investment you make will turn out alright in the long-term but panicking and selling at a loss just because the price went down isnt going to make u money especially if nothing about the company changed.\n\nJust today as I write this my portfolio is down about 3 percent while the nasdaq is only down about 0.5 percent. I am not too worried because I am investing with money I don't necessarily need right now and am investing for the long-term so temporary downturns are only opportunities to add to my highest conviction positions. The point is, if you are investing like me theres no need to panic about what is happening now. \n\nAnyway, I wish u all good gains in the rest of the year and don't stress about the market too much, there is more important stuff in life to worry about and we've got time on our hands.\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso, if you are relatively new to investing and want to learn more, there is alot you can learn just through reading books and practicing doing your own DD on stocks\n\nThis post gives a pretty good starting point:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m85sp6/list_of_books_to_read_if_you_want_to_actually/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",
