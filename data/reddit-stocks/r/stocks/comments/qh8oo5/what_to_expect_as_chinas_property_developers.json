This comes after low property sales in September, the  downgrading of several Chinese property developers’ bonds(Namely Evergrande in September), and one  of the largest Chinese property developers, Evergrande, announcing difficulties with $300 billion of debt (2). It is estimated right now that nearly $100 billion of that debt is owed to US investors. Other notable  events include Fantasia defaulting earlier this month and Sinic Holdings looking to default on bond debt  soon. With all property developers in China estimated to be $33 trillion in debt by Nomura Investments,  Siwei saying that “nearly every developer having borrowings in disguise” (3), and $64 billion in dollar  denominated bonds (4), which make up nearly half of all dollar-denominated junk bonds, the future  looks daunting for Chinese property developers and the Chinese real estate market. Clearly, as property  developers in China continue to default, it can have serious repercussions on the Chinese economy as  well as the US bond market.\n With real estate making up over 25% of the Chinese economic markets(5), what can investors  expect as the situation continues? Will other property developers fall like dominoes or will the  government try to intervene on the situation? If property developers liquidate their real estate holdings  and assets in order to pay their bond debt and not default, that could also devalue the very real estate  which they are trying to sell. Furthermore, it would have profound effects on the emerging Chinese  middle-class who have almost all investments in real-estate because of excellent promised ROI and a  very volatile stock market (6). Such worries sparked protests at Evergrande’s headquarters earlier this  month (7), with demonstrators storming inside and demanding their investments back from the  company. These worries have caused China’s central authorities to issue warnings for local authorities  to prepare for serious civil unrest (8). And even if the government were to intervene and prop up the  real-estate market or simply bail out these failing developers, there would still be some fallout. It could  be expected that the government would only bail out debt to Chinese financiers and snub international  investors. Though most notably, because it would take billions, or even trillions, of dollars to solve this  issue the Yuan would undergo high inflation.\n Even with the Hang Seng and Shanghai markets seeing an uptrend in the last several months,  investors in the Chinese market could expect a downturn should property developers continue to  default on their debts. This would not only affect the real-estate market in China, but also other sectors  such as commodities and finance. All in all, the trend of property developers defaulting on their bond payments looks very dangerous for anyone who wants to invest in the Chinese markets. Trillions of dollars of debt along with  a slowdown in the Chinese real-estate market look like they could cause a serious downtrend in the  Chinese economy as a whole .\n\n*Edited for spacing*",
