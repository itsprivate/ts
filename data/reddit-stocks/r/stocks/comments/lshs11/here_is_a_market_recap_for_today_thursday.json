The S&P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell by 2.4% and 1.73% respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by 3.5%, recording its worst day since October 2020. In other news, “meme stocks” favored by retail traders in Reddit and other social media users surged once again, with shares of Gamestop (GME) spiking more than 150% in the last two days, reigniting rumors that the short-squeeze is back on. The reasons behind the latest surge or unclear. While we will always support retail traders’ right to freely invest in the equities they choose, we recommend a lot of caution if you decide to open a position here.\n\nUS Treasury yields rose to fresh one-year highs, breaking above 1.45% for the first time since February 2020. As a reminder, the Treasury yield represents the return on investment, or the interest, the US government is willing to pay out on their debt obligations, such as bonds. For example, if a person buys a Treasury bond with a 10-year expiration, they are lending the US government money with the expectation of being repaid the face value of the bond, plus some interest (which is the yield). In practice, higher yields make money more expensive to borrow and bonds more attractive, putting pressure on equities, especially high-growth equities like tech stocks that rely on the ability to borrow lots of money.\n\nDuring his semiannual testimony on monetary policy this week, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.” Powell’s logic seems to be that higher yields in the 10-year notes are positive because it means investors are willing to bet the US economy will be able to pay them back plus interest when the timeframe of the bond expires.\n\nFurthermore, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was going to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, \"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) spiked after the company announced plans to introduce a subscription service for content creators and said it looks to double its annual revenue and accelerate user growth over the next few years. One of the only stocks to perform well today.\n* Boeing Co faces a new fine from U.S. regulators as part of an expected settlement with U.S. regulators over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years. This comes shortly after a Boeing 787’s engine caught fire mid-flight. Boeing will also have to inspect and retrofit existing 787 Dreamliners, which could potentially cost the company billions of dollars.\n* Coinbase Global made public on Thursday the prospectus for its much-anticipated initial public offering, setting up the company to possibly launch its IPO in March. Coinbase in the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, with more than 43 million verified users last year, up 34% from 32 million users in 2019\n* Target (TGT) is creating enclaves for Apple (AAPL) products at its retail stores that would double the space for the tech company's products in certain Target locations.\n* China's Geely Automobile and its Swedish sister company Volvo Cars will abandon merger plans but launch a new entity to combine their powertrain operations and expand cooperation on electric vehicles, the companies said.\n\nCurrent stock price is written in the morning and does not include intraday movement. \n* Booking (BKNG) with two target raises.
