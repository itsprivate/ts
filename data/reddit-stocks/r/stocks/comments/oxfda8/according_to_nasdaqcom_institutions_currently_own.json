[CNN Business](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=Z&subView=institutional) is reporting institutional ownership of 105.84%.\n\nHow do institutions alone own more than 100% of all available shares of a stock? What about retail? How much do they own? It has to be unreported institutional short-selling, doesn't it?\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso quick looked up Zillow's Class A Stock, ZG.\n\n[Nasdaq says](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/zg/institutional-holdings) institutions own 90.77% of ZG - with [CNN Business](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=ZG&subView=institutional) reporting the same.\n\nWhile that's not over 100%, it still seems like a pretty high number.
