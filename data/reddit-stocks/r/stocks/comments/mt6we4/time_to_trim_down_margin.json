I'm very bullish for this year but I think we will continue to see healthy pullbacks after each run. \n\nI suggest if you're like me, and use margin to a decent extent, now would be the time to take SOME of the profits and wait for a little downturn to buy more. I do not suggest at all pulling out completely because that would be stupid, this market is going up overall, but I fear margin users may have gotten too comfortable and a resurgence in volatility may happen going into may-june. \n\nIt would be nice to see a little pullback just to pick up some good bargains, because honestly, stocks are expensive right now. So my two cents, free up some of that money to buy some dips and get right back in. If you're using leverage, take the profits it has beseeched you and wait for an opportune time to put it to work again. I think margin is a great tool in these market cycles when used wisely, and cautiously. \n\nI use margin so that I don't have to be too greedy with my own money, I instead can be safe with my brokers, and still get a nice slice of pie. But the risk of leveraging losses during a volatile market is something I don't want to risk.\n\nI also am not trying to spread any fear at all, this is a bull market, but I also advise to keep a close eye on your account if you use margin and make sure that you have quality names right now. Can never get too comfortable, and when it's calm like this it is the time to be prepared, especially when you have the capitol to properly protect yourself for relatively cheap.",
