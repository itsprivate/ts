The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).\n\nI have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I’m not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything – just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.\n\n**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**\n\nThink of getting your driver’s license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I’m stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don’t need to hold a stock that long. But I think it’s a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?\n\n**Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?**\n\nNothing new here. But it’s usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.\n\n**Test 3: Did it already moon?**\n\nThis was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.\n\n**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**\n\nIdeally I’d like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I’m hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.\n\n**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**\n\nMaybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It’s nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn’t bad either.\n\nOf course, it’s hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn’t be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?",
