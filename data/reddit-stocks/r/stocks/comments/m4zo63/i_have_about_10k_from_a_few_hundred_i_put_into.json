I have not touched this account for over 7 years, and this is close to the most money I have ever had in any bank account (being a student whose account is drained each semester). I feel a heavy burden to get this right. I do not want to become an active investor, I am just at a point where I need to do a bit of activity.\n\nIf anyone has any readings they could recommend specifically on Ford or AMD, that would be very helpful. Some more general, introductory recommendations would be helpful too. I like to think of myself as a quick learner, so I wouldn't mind more intermediate or advanced texts either. This would help give me a greater picture of the depth of knowledge in the field as well.\n\nThank you.",
