This is just crazy.

Tesla shareholders will get burned.\n\nIt might burst in 2021. It is just too big. If it doubles, the market cap would reach 1.7 Trillion.\n\nApple has a 2.4 Trillion market cap because it is a leader in cell phones sales worldwide in addition to the billions it makes in computer and laptop sales, and other tech. Apple makes financial sense but Tesla does not even produce a positive income. Apple made $57.411 Billion in NET income in 2020 while Tesla made negative 900 million in 2019 and had a greater loss in 2020.\n\nIf this bubble bursts a lot of people will get hurt, particularly YOUNG investors. All the paper millionaires will become poor in a few days, similar to what occured when the dot.com bubble burst.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Tesla has a machinery of people just hired to post positive Tesla news on Reddit to keep pumping it's stock value up. The most common brainwashing phrases: \"Tesla is not just a car company, Tesla is the Future\" \"Tesla's Autonomous driving will take over the world\" and more nonsense.",
