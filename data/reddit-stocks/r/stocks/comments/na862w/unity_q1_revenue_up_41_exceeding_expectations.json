(NYSE: U), the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.\n\n“Our first quarter results are reflective of the powerful transition from linear 2D to real-time 3D, which is one of the most important changes in how people interact with technology,” said John Riccitiello, President and Chief Executive Officer, Unity. “We believe that real-time 3D will continue to grow at an accelerated pace and achieve massive scale.”\n\nUnity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D (RT3D) content. With Unity, creators have the tools to become RT3D creators. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, automotive designers, filmmakers and others, use Unity to make their creative vision come to life. With this broad approach, we believe the opportunity to create and operate rich and immersive experiences is almost limitless, setting up Unity to not only anchor tomorrow’s most advanced applications but to enable and power the metaverse at the most foundational level.\n\n“Execution in the first quarter was very strong with revenue of $234.8 million, an increase of 41% from last year. We are encouraged by the growth of our customers contributing more than $100K of trailing twelve-month revenue and the healthy dollar-based net expansion rate during the first quarter,” said Luis Visoso, Chief Financial Officer, Unity. “We continue to invest strategically in R&D and vertical expansion to enable Unity to lead the transition to real-time 3D.”\n\n[read more ](https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2021/Unity-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx)",
