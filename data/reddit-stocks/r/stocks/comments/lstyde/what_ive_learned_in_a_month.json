Some of these points are pontifications and others are meant to help fellow newbs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I don't know shit, but I came in recognizing that. I'm like that with everything I start because if you think you're billy badass at something you'll never learn. My girl's dad is an trading freak and rambles on about resistance, and patterns and ex dividend dates and deep research into companies and I just sit there thinking ok, you're a master at this but I'm banging your daughter.  But seriously, he's been a huge help. We've bonded over it actually, he just throws out too much at once. Anyways, the point is, mouth shut, challenge everything you see online and pay attention to everything. \n2. I've quickly learned to identify and stay away from hype and other manipulation. I dropped all my shares in a certain drone company when the stock dropped like a brick after some bozo posted a hit piece on it without stopping to check the ridiculously written sources or use common sense. That being said, I lucked out. I sold at a tiny profit, and got back in at a much lower price. \n3. I've realized that if something causes a stock to explode, the prime time to get in on that train has already passed by the time I hear about it so there's no point in rushing to get in on it or putting everything on it. \n4. Quickly trying to turn around stocks within days for a quick buck rapidly lost its appeal and I've drifted over to mid to long term holds \n5. There's a bunch of loudmouth assholes all over the yahoo message boards and I wish it'd get moderated. I want to see useful posts, not spamming links and people telling other people how much money they have and how stupid everyone is. \n6. I do check my account all the damn time. It's addicting. \n7. Those of you who post well thought out posts backed by great DD and facts, I see you. Thanks. It's honorable to take the time to help out others when you get nothing in return. \n8. Those of you who spout off nonsense like you think you know what you're talking about but you don't, you just want to appear smarter than everyone else to make up for the fact your dad never thought much of you, I see right through you, and don't think much of you either. \n9. I get the sense that many new investors think they're special, the stocks they buy are special, they assume they're going to hit it big because they believe the loudmouths saying they made a million in a day and I suggest that you remove the egocentric view and look at it objectively. It's a VERY big lesson I learned in my long sports betting career. \n10. I'll say it again. There's much to learn. Last two weeks I've learned what all the numbers and statistics on stocks were (yields, earnings, dividend, 52 week high/low etc). Now I'm focusing on researching companies and comparing what i find to how the stock behaves. Next I'll move on to candlestick patterns and how to anticipate them. Trying to absorb everything at once you'll fail\n11. Options, calls, warrants - Nope. If I don't understand it, I don't do it. I feel a pang of pity when a new investor loses everything because they jumped into that stuff without understanding it. \n\nEdit: I don't mean I'll never use them. I just mean I need to understand how they work better before I start messing with them \n\n12. I don't like when the major blogs and news articles promote or bash a stock but only post one side. Makes me think they have an end game and that's not to altruistically help others make informed decisions.  In fact, I rarely take them seriously unless I see other sources that correlate with what they're talking about \n13. I got in when the market was skyrocketing and it took a day or two of all red for me to calm myself and realize it's the way it goes. I've left everything I have (Though I should get rid of S.PCE, thats the position i have that I consider the biggest gamble) and will add more as I see reasonable\n14. I'm focused more on good decisions rather than quick money. Maybe I'll get addicted to opiates in the future and start doing wild shit IDK, but I feel if I start treating this as a casino where I don't give a \\*\\*\\*\\* if I lose all my money as long as I'm drunk when I leave then I will do exactly that. \n15. It's fun. I'm glad I got into this. Not only is idle money making money, It's a whole new subject with a lot of financial potential for me to learn and perhaps master someday. This is a great subreddit with great people and I'm looking forward to being part of it for many years. Good luck out there and thanks for all the informative posts",
