I wanted during the break, before going back to university for my sophomore year to join a hackathon or two and do some projects on the side. Well, I joined a hackathon and didn&#39;t do any projects until now, so because uni is starting in a couple of weeks and not having a lot of time, I decided my project should be small. I juiced my brain for ideas until I decided on the genius idea of creating a chrome extension, that detects rickrolling links. I did this whole thing on python, it&#39;s quite simple actually when you right-click there is an option where it says if you wanna check if it&#39;s a rickroll, through machine learning it sees if the video&#39;s audio is the same as the original rickrolls audio (I did this because people use different links aside from the original Never Gonna Give You Up music video. I created a youtube video, illustrating what I did a how I did it accompanied by the source code on GitHub and a link to download the extension. This is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVbPq99jyJY\">video</a> if you want to watch it. I hope y&#39;all enjoy it :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
