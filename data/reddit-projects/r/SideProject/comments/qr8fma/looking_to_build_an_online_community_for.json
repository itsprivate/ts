I received so many great responses and a few DMs on how I received the offer with very little experience in PM. After offering my insight and explaining the steps I took to get the offer, I started thinking about how to create an online community of aspiring PMs to network, share/learn tips and tricks during the job search, among other things. So I am taking another shot in the dark by asking if there are APMs (current or aspiring) that would like to create a community (possibly on discord) of like-minded individuals? Also, are there any senior PMs, Product VPs, or CPOs that would like to serve as SMEs and help make this &#39;product&#39; awesome?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
