I wanted them just once a week, with my coffee, like a weekend newspaper. So I started working on Email Monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an email forwarding/firewall for your real email address.&lt;br/&gt;\nNever reveal your real email anymore, by masking your email address with unlimited forwarding addresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tired of a specific sender? turn them off in the dashboard, or turn off the entire alias. No more searching for unsubscribe links.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tired of getting newsletters every day? Just one click, to get them once a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing competitor research? digest all their emails to a single &amp;quot;report&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love your feedback. It&amp;#39;s a hard concepts and lots of features to explain on the landing page, if you have any tips, ideas, better ways to simplify the features it would be a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Maybe a walkthrough video with a demo? ðŸ¤”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks! ðŸ’™&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/62usity234681.png?width=2097&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47ad0e0f40422d3d7e792ca265334f155f589dee\"&gt;Raaaaaar!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
