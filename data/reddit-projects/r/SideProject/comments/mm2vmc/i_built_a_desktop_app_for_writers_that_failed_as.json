I wanted a light-weight Windows desktop app that gave me everything I needed to write my novel and nothing more. \n\nhttps://www.smart-edit.com/Writer/\n\nNo clutter. No excess. No functionality I'd never use. And no need to watch a 4 hour video to work out how to use it! \n\nI wanted, and built: \n\n- Scene by scene writing \n- Ability to move scenes around using drag and drop \n- Easy access to research material \n- Built in editing functionality just for novel writers \n- Built in Draft process so that I can compare my work to previous versions \n- Automatic backups \n- And of course, a dark theme \n\nIt never made it as a commercial app and it's been free for a good while now. I've been adding to it over time, growing its features slowly. \n\nMy latest addition (Version 9, released yesterday) is a built in versioning system ([Document Drafts](https://www.smart-edit.com/Writer/Knowledge/Page/Drafts/)) that no other writing app has. Not even Scrivener! \n\nIt’ll never make me money, but it’s right up there amongst the best things I’ve ever built.",
