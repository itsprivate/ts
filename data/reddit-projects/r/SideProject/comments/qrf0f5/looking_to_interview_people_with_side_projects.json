It&#39;s a great way to promote. For the interview, we&#39;ll meet over zoom, I&#39;ll ask you about your side project, how you got into it, what was difficult about it, what has been awesome, and I&#39;ll ask follow up questions to dig deeper. Comment below or PM me if you are interested.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
