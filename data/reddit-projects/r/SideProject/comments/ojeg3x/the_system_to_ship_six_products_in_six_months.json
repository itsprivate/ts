A few of them are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://spreadtheworld.net\">SpreadTheWorld</a> 400+ places to post your startup.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gum.co/userbooster\">UserBooster</a> a Notion dashboard to get early traction.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remotefr.com\">RemoteFR</a> a Job board for French dev jobs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After spending the last few years working for startups, Xavier decided to become an indie hacker, build his own products and started the challenge to ship six products in six months. In this interview, <strong>I ask him about his process to create, ship, validate, and sometimes abandon projects as fast as possible.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://quicktalks.io/talks/build-fast-ship-fast-xavier-coiffard\">watch the full interview here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Find below some lessons learned and takeaways👇</p>\n\n<p>💡 <strong>Validating ideas</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>The first thing I do to validate an idea is to ask myself: is it a problem only for me or is it a real problem for other people? How many people have the same problem? Is it painful enough for people to pay for it? How easy it is to build?</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>💨 <strong>Build fast, ship fast, validate fast</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>With no-code tools I&#39;m able to build prototypes super fast which allows me to validate my ideas. Because at the end of the day, you can try to validate an idea talking with people but the real validation comes when people are buying your product.</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>🏷 <strong>Marketing for tech people</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Marketing is usually hard for technical people but you can see it as code, you can hack the marketing. It&#39;s about knowing the techniques, understanding how to lead a conversation... it also very technical and you can definitely learn it.</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>🙇‍♂️ <strong>Developer mentality</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>One of the drawbacks of being a developer is that you always want to code one more feature, change the logo, or fix something, but nobody cares about that. The only thing that matters is if you solve a problem. If that&#39;s the case, people will buy your product.</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://quicktalks.io/talks/build-fast-ship-fast-xavier-coiffard\">watch the full interview on QuickTalks</a> or a few clips on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbSCxYzhM-b8fILPWo4YrQ\">QuickTalks Clips Youtube channel</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKYjknrfXVM&amp;list=PL30JGAYz4ENhtz04LCJXsll7W_NwAgLPY&amp;index=2\">4 RULES to validate product ideas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwKXOqIOA98&amp;list=PL30JGAYz4ENhtz04LCJXsll7W_NwAgLPY&amp;index=1\">Lessons learned selling digital products</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy it ✌️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
