Algorithms promote content that sparks outrage, hate, and amplifies biases to further monetize us. A lot of concerned users have already left social media long time ago because they couldn&#39;t find a better alternative. Unfortunately, they continue to destroy our communities every day. We believe, there should be some independent and public-owned social media alternatives to private social media networks. (#TheSocialDilemma #biasedbanning)</p>\n\n<p>We created a new social media project, called &quot;JustOne&quot;. JustOne is a women &amp; LGBTQIA+ managed nonprofit ethical photo sharing social media network. It is also going to be fully open source and run on a decentralized network.</p>\n\n<p>Note: We greatly value your feedback. And also, looking for other co-founders for partnership. Please DM me for the Testflight invitations, but also feel free to provide general feedback about the idea. Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
