There&#39;s just no easy way to do so. So last year I decided to fix this problem, taught myself to code, and along with a friend built Melofic.</p>\n\n<p>Melofic is a social platform for musicians to connect and collaborate. The goal is to help musicians discover each other, describe their music and sound, and to grow. Melofic makes it easy to find like-minded musicians and to meet and collaborate with them.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to solve the problems I faced as a musician. Melofic helps artists find and connect with other artists either locally or internationally. It also promotes the culture of getting reviews on your music from fellow artists on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>We launched the web app for melofic 7 months ago and got really positive feedback from the community, so we decided to take it a step further. This week we launched the native Android app for Melofic (iOS coming soon)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/glfd6mf7s5081.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c30c5a3436beef3525c68e68621333a0c44dae4\">https://preview.redd.it/glfd6mf7s5081.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c30c5a3436beef3525c68e68621333a0c44dae4</a></p>\n\n<p>The Melofic app gives musicians the power to discover, collaborate and grow. Intuitively find other musicians based on your personal skills or listen to others&#39; creations as well as collaborate with each other as you share the same goal of music efficiency. Use Melofic to network with people from all around the world as you grow together into one big community.</p>\n\n<p>Melofic contains no ads and is 100% free to use.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you&#39;re looking to discover new tunes, collaborate with someone new, or just connect with like-minded people, Melofic is the perfect music community for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re a musician i&#39;d really appreciate if you guys to check it out and be a part of its initial users/reviewers.</p>\n\n<p>Signup today! <a href=\"http://www.melofic.com/\">www.melofic.com</a></p>\n\n<p>PlayStore App -<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melofic\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melofic</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
