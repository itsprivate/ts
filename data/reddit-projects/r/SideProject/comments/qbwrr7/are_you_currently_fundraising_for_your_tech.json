As ex-entrepreneurs and investors ourselves, we noticed a need to address this gap in the market and so we set out to create thebacker - a platform that can help founders find and connect with their force-multipliers.</p>\n\n<p>We recently just launched a private beta and we wanted to welcome members of the community here to check it out. <a href=\"https://thebacker-mvp.bubbleapps.io/\">CLICK HERE TO ACCESS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How it works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Build your founder profile</li>\n<li>Share more information about your startup - industry, technologies, amount raising etc</li>\n<li>Receive a list of curated investors from our algorithm</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Feel free to share any candid feedback/insights you may have on any aspect of the platform as we would really appreciate that :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
