I would like to create a go-to place for non-fiction readers. For now thinking providing newsletter and a clean interface to search in a database.   </p>\n\n<p>Demo of this project is launched at: <a href=\"https://thenonfictionlibrary.com\">https://thenonfictionlibrary.com</a>  </p>\n\n<p>My question to you I guess would be what would it takes to make people like this website and be a happy user?   </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just getting started, pretty much created just a clean website where I can build features on top. What features to add I want to define with non-fiction users. Will it make sense?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
