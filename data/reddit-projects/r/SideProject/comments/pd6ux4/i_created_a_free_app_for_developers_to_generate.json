You can find the app here: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devsigner/id1573136365\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devsigner/id1573136365</a></p>\n\n<p>I am an iOS developer and have a passtion of creating iOS apps. But most of the time, I find myself spending more time in creating graphic assets for my apps than writing code. Especially for the app icons, where iOS developers need to generate a lot of sizes for different purposes in catalog assets. Moreover a developer doesn&#39;t necessary has enough designig skills or required tools to create such icons easily.</p>\n\n<p>Devsigner tries to solve this problem by providing a simple tool to help any developer to create an app icon in an easy way.</p>\n\n<p>💕 Multiple icon fonts such as Material Fonts from Google, Fluent System from Microsoft, and Fontawesome\n🥰 Twitter emojis\n🔡 Over hundred built-in fonts from iOS</p>\n\n<p>You can find more info at the app <a href=\"https://devsigner.antran.app/\">landing page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The app supports generation of asset catalogs and they can be imported into Xcode directly.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear your feedback and feel free to suggest new ideas or tell me what is missing from the app. I will try my best to get them implemented. Feel free to leave comment here or contact me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antranapp\">Twitter</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
