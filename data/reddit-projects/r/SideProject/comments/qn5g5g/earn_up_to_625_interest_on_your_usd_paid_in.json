We just launched <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/thresholds\">Thresholds on Product Hunt</a>, and I’d love to get your feedback - and maybe an upvote :)</p>\n\n<p>Checking/savings accounts offer negligible interest (0.05% interest) on your funds and while USD stable coins + Defi offer a low-risk way to earn high yields, it&#39;s quite inconvenient to access. That&#39;s why I decided to create a crypto-connected checking account that would make crypto and decentralized finance more accessible for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been in closed beta, but today we&#39;ve just launched our DeFi growth account on Product Hunt. Users can now earn up to 6.25% interest on your USD (powered by DeFi).</p>\n\n<p><strong>While our waitlist has grown pretty rapidly, we’ve decided to open access for the next 24 hours so anyone can create an account (after which we’ll be going back to waitlist + invite-only).</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on the project, get feedback on the landing page, and answer any questions you might have!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
