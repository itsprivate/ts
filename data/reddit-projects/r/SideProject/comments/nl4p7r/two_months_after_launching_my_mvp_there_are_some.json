It takes some learning to get right, but it wouldn't take you more than a day to add it in well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Prompt Users for Feedback**\n\nIt's an MVP. You need to know how people are using your product, and where they think it's going to be improved. Finding the right moment to prompt for feedback can be tricky, but very worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Be Descriptive**\n\nYour product is new. People do not know how to use your product. Be descriptive, no matter how simple it seems to you. For example, my app used to say:\n\n\"Add some friends\"\n\nAnd now it says:\n\n\"To add friends, go to the search tab and look for their username\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Add an Onboarding Process**\n\nIn relation to being more descriptive, give users a tour when they walk in! Let them know how you intend for them to use your product.\n\nUsers will benefit from learning the language that you are creating within your product's environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. Implement one-click login**\n\nPasswords suck to type, verifying your password sucks, getting a verification email sucks, etc..\n\nUse a federated login because you will lose people with an annoying signup process.\n\nTrust me, I've lost hundreds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're building an MVP, I hope these tips help :) If you liked this, [you can follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/_joshuafonseca).",
