College students can search their school and club, then read reviews left by other students. During my freshman year, I went through a list of literally 1600 clubs just to figure out which clubs to join. Then, I sat through a couple boring ClubFest Zoom calls just to figure out I didn&#39;t want to join the club anyways. As a result, I developed this and hopefully we can get enough reviews to make the website useful for other students. If you are/were involved in any clubs in college, leave some reviews!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
