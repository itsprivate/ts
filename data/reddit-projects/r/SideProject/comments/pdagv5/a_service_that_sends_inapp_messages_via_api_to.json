Gist does the same for in-app messages, it offers an API to queue personalized messages and a message builder to create cross-platform messages.</p>\n\n<p>In October I&#39;ll be removing the invite system so anyone can just go in and create an account. If you want to be reminded when that happens please add yourself to <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/6a22e439c3fd/gist-access\">this list</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Please have a look at <a href=\"https://gist.build/\">Gist</a> and let me know your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
