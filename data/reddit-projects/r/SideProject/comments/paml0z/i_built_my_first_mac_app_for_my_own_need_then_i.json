Besides, I missed the peaceful moments that my puppy was sleeping around while I studied during school time.  </p>\n\n<p>Then I came up with the idea to build an app that shows a sleeping pet on the menu bar, and the pet might remind you to take a break too (I am a fan of the Pomodoro technique). I was so excited about that and spent nights and weekends building it. Besides, I ordered the freelance designer to sketch the icon pack too.  </p>\n\n<p>After finishing MVP, I shared it with some of my friends for feedback. After several feedback loops, I improved the app and released the first version on Mac App Store as a paid app ($3.99).</p>\n\n<p>Then, several days ago, I decided to share on /macapps subreddit to get more feedback. Unbelievably, it became a hit. I got a lot of great comments and feature requests that I have not even thought of. Some of them even had a private chat with me. They are so nice to give me suggestions. The most useful ones are from a CTO who gave me an actionable list of feedback.  </p>\n\n<p>Then, after gathering feedback, I jumped into updating the app and releasing a new version within 24 hours. Wow, people love that, especially, the users who had requests for new pets. I added 3 new ones in that version. It reinforced what I learned that &quot;listening to the users and making them happy&quot; is a correct direction for product development and business. And the great idea usually is the one that solves our own problem.  </p>\n\n<p>By the way, here is my app (PetBar) on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/petbar-a-pet-on-your-menu-bar/id1580266242?l=en&amp;mt=12\">App Store</a> in case you want to check it out.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
