The designer upgraded this traditional sensibility by decreasing the contrast in the strokes and exaggerating the geometric aspects. This resulted in an eclectic style that communicates modernity and elevation. It can be used for logos and branding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Design idea: elevate visuals with  Dynamic Diagonal</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ellen Lupton, the senior curator at Smithsonian Design Museum, published a book explaining the magic behind what makes posters work as visuals.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Her key findings?</strong> A majority of poster compositions relied on diagonals to cut across the composition to create eye-catching details. Diagonal lines make our eyes scan across a visual with ease and have a more engaging way of breaking up the negative and positive spaces. If you want to spice up your visual, consider creating diagonal lines in your design.</p>\n\n<p>I share tips like this weekly, you can <a href=\"https://fonts.substack.com/\">subscribe</a> if you feel like.
