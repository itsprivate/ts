Every day, we poll readers on a trending news topic after presenting them with highly-credible articles from across the political spectrum. In addition to the poll, readers will now be able to engage with each other on a discussion forum where conversations are built to be more productive and less likely to result in an echo chamber or flame war. </p>\n\n<p>To reduce the likelihood of echo chambers, all user comments are anonymous so people can speak honestly without professional backlash or without feeling pressure to say what others expect of them. Also, users cannot see how many upvotes a comment has received, except your own comments, to reduce voting based on popularity.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the risk of flame wars, The Factual seeks to highlight the highest quality comments first. We determine comment quality based on several signals such as length, tone of writing, and, notably, how likely the commenter is to be knowledgeable based on &quot;Respects&quot; they&#39;ve earned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.thefactual.com/discuss-dont-divide-the-factual-fosters-productive-discussions-on-the-news\"><strong>new community forum</strong></a> <strong>launches today, and we’d be honored if you could check it out and let us know what you think.
