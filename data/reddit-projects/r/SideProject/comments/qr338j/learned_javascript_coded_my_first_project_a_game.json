I wanted to learn some basics about coding to make communication with my CTO smoother so I bought a “JavaScript for Dummies for Kids” book and coded along with some of the projects in the book. Then, I came up with an idea for a game of my own. I know it’s nothing special but also keep in mind I could only code in my free time (I work as a 2nd grade teacher full time) and I had absolutely no coding or computer experience beyond what I’ve seen on the TV show Mr. Robot lol. It took me about 2 weeks to actually code everything and I let it sit for months before taking initiative to actually deploy it with AWS. Tell me what you think, and drop your high scores! It’s called Stroopsoup.com</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
