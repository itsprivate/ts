And why would you care in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you ever find yourself doing something repetitive over and over? Guesstimating what a number (length of a video, date where you post content on reddit) should be? Do you have a small business and need to prioritize which customers to serve first?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these are problems that can easily be solved once you start using ML. I hope I can enable more small businesses, students, and amateurs to get into machine learning with MLConsole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Open to feedback as this is still very early-days, and there are still many features on the roadmap before a full launch. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
