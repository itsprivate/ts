Influencers and brands can also carry out comprehensive competitor analysis to understand the kind of content that is working well for them.)</p>\n\n<p>We’ve been working on the content calendar feature for some time now, and it is currently at its testing stage. It will also suggest captions and will consider the best time to post for the accounts in consideration. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV4kfMz-hJc\">Here’s what it’s looking like so far</a></p>\n\n<p>I’d really appreciate feedback on this, as we want this feature to go live as soon as possible (you can be as brutal as you like, all criticism is welcome)! If there’s anything you think I should add or remove, do let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you’d like free early access to this, let me know! I’d gladly give you access in exchange for feedback and suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Cheerio!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
