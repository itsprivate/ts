I was afraid to share my tool with the community. I saw some mean comments on someone else&#39;s post, a fellow maker who shared his tool. It hurt me to see those comments; maybe you don&#39;t like that tool or its creator, but trust me – building tools is hard work especially when you don&#39;t have any funds and have to continue your full-time job. Anyway, I found most of you are super helpful and encouraging. Thank you so much for your support.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>I want this community to keep growing. Here are the details I&#39;ve learned about my own tool after I&#39;m done sharing this with you.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I&#39;ve got very positive feedback and a few nasty criticisms.</li>\n<li>Got 50 new registered users and they continue to use my tool.</li>\n<li>I got suggestions on how you can utilize my software for your business copywriting.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So, I am planning to create some step-by-step tutorials about <a href=\"https://CopywriterPro.ai\">CopywriterPro.ai</a> tools. What&#39;s your preference, Docs or Youtube tutorial?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
