For a long time I wondered why the way we store files in the digital space has remained unchanged from how we’ve been storing physical paper for centuries. About three years ago, I decided there must be a better way and, after studying an MSc in innovation and entrepreneurship at a top European school, I dedicated myself with a team of crazy genius engineers to the creation of a new cloud storage service that functions a whole lot like the memory of the human brain. It associates everything thrown into it with its context (what it’s about, which information it relates to, where it’s from, who created it, when it was saved, how important is it, etc.) instead of just one folder path or keywords. \n\nThe software lets you store all your digital resources (photos, videos, docs, websites, notes, etc.) in one place and understands how they are connected – a bit like an automated version of a PI’s bulletin board, but with three dimensions instead of two. Amongst 5 ways of looking at your files, there’s even a 3D visualisation showing you how all your data is connected and stored. Our friends love it :)\n\nWe’re online and slowly rolling out the Beta version to gather very first feedback before our big unveil at the Mobile World Congress / 4YFN in Barcelona. So here is my question to you: How do you feel about having a personal Google, but more advanced – being able to search by filters and anything you know about the item you’re looking for, not just keywords? Have you noticed any drawbacks of the standard folder-based file system that we know? Is Reach (the name of our service) something you’re willing to try out?",
