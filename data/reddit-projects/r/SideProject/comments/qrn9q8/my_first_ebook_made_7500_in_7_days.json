  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A few months back, I published my first (paid) <a href=\"https://simonhoiberg.com/ebooks/javascript-in-the-industry?utm_source=reddit\">e-book</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In total, it made +$7,500 in just 7 days.\nIt still makes +$2,000 every month today.</p>\n\n<p>Let me break down the strategy, the expenses, and the effort spent on this product.</p>\n\n<h2>Finances</h2>\n\n<p>First, let&#39;s get a financial overview.</p>\n\n<h3>💳 Expenses</h3>\n\n<p>🔹 E-book creation:\n- Book cover: $47,-\n- Proofreading: $52,-</p>\n\n<p>🔹 Marketing:\n- Promoted post on IG: $182,-\n- Paid ads: $250,-</p>\n\n<h3>💰 Revenue</h3>\n\n<p>🔸 Sales: $7,985,-</p>\n\n<p>💸 Net Profit: <strong>~$7.450,-</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Time spent</h2>\n\n<p>Secondly, let&#39;s get an overview of the time spent.</p>\n\n<h3>📖 Writing the e-book:</h3>\n\n<p>16 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>🌍 Website + Stripe integration</h3>\n\n<p>10 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>📧 Creating email drips:</h3>\n\n<p>4 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>📣 Creating promotional content:</h3>\n\n<p>6 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>⏱️ Additional marketing efforts:</h3>\n\n<p>4 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Total time spent:\n40 hours.</p>\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, I ended up spending more time on marketing and distribution than I did writing the actual e-book.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>Because every successful product launch requires a solid marketing effort.\nThis is where most e-book authors I&#39;ve seen get it wrong!</p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re done creating your e-book, you need to do more than just tweeting about it.</p>\n\n<p>Make a sales strategy.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What are your acquisition channel(s)</li>\n<li>How will you use it to generate sales?</li>\n<li>How much do you expect to convert from each? (make reasonable assumptions).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some strategies include creating initial hype around the product (doing a pre-launch), and some include re-targeting qualified leads.</p>\n\n<p>The channel I used which turned out most effective: emails!\nI launched a free e-book 3 months earlier.</p>\n\n<p>It resulted in +300 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews and +10,000 downloads!</p>\n\n<p>Not only did this establish additional trust and authority - it also provided me with 10K emails to retarget with the second e-book 🚀</p>\n\n<p>It was a lot of fun creating this e-book.\nFurthermore, it has gotten a lot of positive feedback, and despite me offering a full 30-day money-back guarantee - not a single person has used it yet.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about my approach, I created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcYPCRT5OH4\">video on YouTube</a> where I go into much more details and reveal a couple of interesting facts 🤓</p>\n\n<p>I hope you got something out of this post.\nCheers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
