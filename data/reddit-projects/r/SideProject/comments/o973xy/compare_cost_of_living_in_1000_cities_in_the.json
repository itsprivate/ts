I am currently looking for monetization ideas though - so will appreciate your ideas and any feedback really!</p>\n\n<p>I myself have moved to a different country a few times, and likely not the last time in my life. And I&#39;ve found it quite difficult to compare not consumer prices, say, for tomatoes or a 2-bed apartment, but my lifestyle as a whole, including how many people are moving, what habits we have, and what services we use.</p>\n\n<p>To address the issue, I built this calculator: <a href=\"https://gromov.com/cost-of-living-calc?utm_source=reddit_sideproj\">https://gromov.com/cost-of-living-calc</a></p>\n\n<p>⚠️It currently doesn&#39;t work on mobile devices (WIP), so please use desktop version.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, it shall be fairly straightforward and hopefully fun to use.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n<p>Oleg</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
