Go play with it and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is certainly not a new concept. It&amp;#39;s heavily inspired by &lt;a href=\"/r/place\"&gt;/r/place&lt;/a&gt;, but it differs in two major ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No account is required to draw. Just click the link and have fun!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The canvas is effectively infinite. If you go to a random spot far from the center, you can start a new drawing in a place people are unlikely to find unless you share the link with them. Start your own semi-private drawing with your friends!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few similar apps have popped up in the past few years, but I found them all to be a little clunky, so I created a new one with a focus on simplicity and a good user experience across desktop and mobile. (I&amp;#39;m an iOS user and haven&amp;#39;t tested this on Android yet, so I&amp;#39;d especially appreciate feedback from Android users.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything updates in real time. I&amp;#39;m excited to see what it looks like when there are active users other than myself üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the link again: &lt;a href=\"https://everyonedraw.com/\"&gt;https://everyonedraw.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mdyyrvc04v281.png?width=2100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47c7cf04efe748ba3b33ff01126a25f037dd44b7\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mdyyrvc04v281.png?width=2100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47c7cf04efe748ba3b33ff01126a25f037dd44b7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
