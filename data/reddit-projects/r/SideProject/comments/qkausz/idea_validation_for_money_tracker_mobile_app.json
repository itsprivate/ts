Now each month every family member contributes to the houehold&#39;s expenses like food, power/water bills, repairs and other expenses. Using the app all family members can track and visualize their expenses and expense trends along with individual expenses/incomes.</p>\n\n<p>There are bunch of other standard features that will be included like analytics, expense categories and more.</p>\n\n<p>I had this idea exactly one year before and I had also started creating some basic input/output screens (example:  <a href=\"https://postimg.cc/K1HXGwqk\">https://postimg.cc/K1HXGwqk</a> ).</p>\n\n<p>Now I need your help to figure out few things before I go all in on this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Would you use this if it&#39;s available for free on either of playstores?</li>\n<li>What problems do you face in particular while budgetting an entire family expense and incomes?</li>\n<li>if you have any suggestions or questions about this, please write them down.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>EDIT #1:</p>\n\n<p>Some of the planned features:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Financial goals for individual and family. (Like vacation to Bali for family and buying a bike for 1 person)</li>\n<li>Flag recurrent expenses and notify self or all members</li>\n<li>Get bill payment reminders and possibly add automatic bill payment feature in the future if thats OK with users</li>\n<li>Option to define income sources/streams for both and offer analytics and insights based on time spent to earn a particular unit of money from each stream. (Ex: I spent 9+ hrs to earn $10 but made $20 from my etsy store in half that time.)</li>\n<li>Calculate Net worth of family and individual</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/qkausz\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
