I built</strong> <a href=\"https://Livedocs.com\"><strong>Livedocs.com</strong></a> <strong>to try and solve that problem.</strong>  </p>\n\n<h1>Backstory — </h1>\n\n<p>A year and a half ago, I was a product owner at a tech co, and I realized I was spending a huge amount of time simply doing document-drudgery. I would update reports and documents for meetings, then more documents for reports that would go out directly to clients (complete with a phone call to walk them through what those numbers mean). </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when I realized, looking back at my career, from small team projects to Fortune 500s, documents were the backbone of every team I was on. At some point, each of those teams build documents that needed constant updating (PNL statements, sales reports, cross-channel marketing reports, etc)  Oddly, teams still lose many hours a day “updating” documents (copy-paste new numbers, screenshots from dashboards, etc). </p>\n\n<p>Once I saw this anti-pattern, I quit my job set out to solve this problem. After months of gathering feedback, testing, building and fine-tuning — I built <a href=\"https://livedocs.com\">livedocs.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Livedocs helps you bring live data from your existing tools into beautiful, customizable documents in just a few clicks. My goal is to enable your team to make data-driven decisions quickly, with zero learning curve.</strong> </p>\n\n<h1>What can I do with livedocs?:</h1>\n\n<p>Here’s some interesting ways I&#39;ve seen Livedocs being used </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Founders</strong>: Solopreneurs, startups, small businesses. Keep track of your teams’ vitals. Livedocs is the fastest way to track revenue, churn, developer productivity, web traffic, conversion, or whatever is most important to your business. Bring in data from Stripe, Google Analytics, Mailchimp, and more. Easy to set up, even easier to share with your team!</li>\n<li><strong>Social media managers:</strong> Build cross-channel reports with data from Twitter, Instagram, Google Analytics, etc. Spend less time visualizing numbers and fighting with spreadsheets, and more time growing brands. Use for in-house social media management or client servicing as an agency</li>\n<li><strong>Marketers and sales operators</strong>: Ads &amp; Performance marketing, financial numbers, and more. Building reports with engagement and web traffic data is literally a 3-click process with Livedocs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s still pretty buggy and would really appreciate if you took it for a spin (start a doc from scratch or check out the small but growing list of <a href=\"https://livedocs.com/templates\">templates you can clone</a>) and offered some feedback. It&#39;s a free, 14-day trial, and I&#39;m happy to offer extended trials and discounts if it sounds like something you see yourself using. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
