In most cases this sub contains good projects people are proud of, but this time I&#39;ll be glad to share how I failed trying to grasp something shiny and popular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not so much into crypto, never traded anything, but curious to learn more about it from the perspective of building tools, not for investing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong></p>\n\n<p>came from a tweet of a guy asking everyone for a tool that indicates a volume % of changes of every crypto currency over 1hour and over 24 hours. I just thought this might be a good learning + experiment to validate something quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I checked some marketplaces and noticed that they don&#39;t have this data (for some reason). So the idea seemed extremely sweet (especially because it&#39;s a hot crypto market)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I already have Flask components to build a simple website with searchable database, so all I needed was to build a script to collect API data.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s fairly simple with Python, 1-2 evenings of work for me. I found a free open API from crypto exchange X and made a script that scrapes it, transforms and loads into the database.</p>\n\n<p>Then this data gets loaded onto the website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitterness:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I went deep into the technical details of API rates, data transformation and its visualization. I didn&#39;t talk to any crypto expert for validating my idea. And that&#39;s where I did a mistake!</p>\n\n<p>Once my site was live and I was ready to go for crypto subreddits to research the way I can ask someone&#39;s opinion, I tried to compare the data with some crypto marketplaces.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that volume (the key metric in my project) for currency X was almost 3 times bigger in my site. I checked currency Y - it was also drastically different. I checked my code, the whole data loading logic, etc - all should work fine.</p>\n\n<p>A few minutes later I realised: each marketplace shows crypto volume differently, since they use different sources. It&#39;s normal that marketplace A (the one I got API from) has 3x less/more compared to marketplace B.</p>\n\n<p>So, my tool should&#39;ve had to pull data from multiple (if not all) marketplaces! A simple conversation with someone from crypto could help me improve it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n<p>⭐ Do the research first. Talk to your potential customers. Ask what they need. Don&#39;t skip this step.</p>\n\n<p>⭐ Once you validated your idea - then go into technical details. Not the opposite. Technical details can blur your eyesight.</p>\n\n<p>⭐ I had some technical lessons learned from my ~3 evenings spent with this project as well. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not so sad about it</p>\n\n<p>⭐ I&#39;ll share it here, hoping to help more builders like myself to avoid this mistake. This should increase the value from this whole experiment</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
