The flight prices change very often due to various factors, therefore it can be really exhausting to search for the best fares. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I started building an automated flight search service. The idea is the user customize search once and after that, our service regularly scans thousands of flight options, finds the best dates, and tracks price changes to find the cheapest offers, sending the best deals to the user&#39;s email address.</p>\n\n<p>After 3 months, we finally launched the first iteration of the service called Manyflights - <a href=\"https://manyflights.io\">https://manyflights.io</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is only the beginning, we&#39;ve got a lot of work ahead, so any advice and feedback from the community will be really useful! </p>\n\n<p>Best,</p>\n\n<p>Niki.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
