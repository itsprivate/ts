Took a picture of her daughter&#39;s drawing, found an artist on fiverr who made a juicy digital version. And ordered a poster at printful. My sister and her friends liked it, so I decided to give it a try.\nI have no experience in e-commerce so I just took a template and filled it in. What do you think? Any tips are welcome!\nMy tiny <a href=\"https://mybaby.design/\">store</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
