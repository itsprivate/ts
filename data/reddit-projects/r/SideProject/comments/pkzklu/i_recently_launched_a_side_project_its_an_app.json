We recently launched our public beta and are looking for feedback on the app itself, as well as other individuals that may be interested in helping on the development of the app!</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to increase the safety and enjoyment of outdoor adventures by improving competency and preparedness. Our suite of trip preparation and packing tools, along with contributions from a community of passionate users aims to create an ecosystem where you can always be prepared for your outdoor excursions. Forgetting an important item can be embarrassing at best, or life threatening and dangerous depending on the circumstances. With packup, we will ensure that no item is left behind.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/inkaty05thm71.jpg?width=1169&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21bf8625e878b9177382a47d666c789712736799\">The Trip Generator allows you to quickly build comprehensive packing lists for your trips by selecting tags, which will generate your packing list from your customizable database of items.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/83k9vle6thm71.jpg?width=1116&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c4a2ecf443c9e1d5299098135d804ee9cfda80\">An example of searching for the word avalanche in your gear closet to find associated items. Your avalanche probe is in there, and is tagged to generate for trips when you&#39;re ski touring or ice climbing. Endless customization available to users.</a></p>\n\n<p>We’ve been through dozens of prototypes, a full alpha testing period, and have received the help and feedback of hundreds of thoughtful and die-hard outdoor users, some of whom have been with us right from our first landing page. Many of the stories of forgotten items have been hilarious to hear from our early users.</p>\n\n<p>The site is built on Gatsby, including using NetlifyCMS for the blog portion. It&#39;s been a blast to build and learn new things so far. It utilizes Firebase for authentication, databases, and cloud functions; Redux for state management; styled-components for styling (fully responsive, so works just as well on phone as it does a large screen); Cloudinary for image management; Formik for forms; Algolia for search; the list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>We have the opportunity to take things a lot further with feedback and a larger development team, and have thought of some of the following feature areas that we could work on in the future:</p>\n\n<p>Minor Features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Custom categorization and tags</li>\n<li>Trip sharing (Leave a plan with loved ones or brag to your friends)</li>\n<li>Weather APIs</li>\n<li>Offline capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Major Features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Group trip planning, and shared lists between party members</li>\n<li>Search capabilities for regions or activity type</li>\n<li>Item weight module and total packed weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, we&#39;ve validated that there is a market for this, and we are looking to grow the team, so we can ship more features, faster! If you consider yourself an outdoorsy person and are interested in the problem (and want to help build the solution!), we&#39;d love to chat with you about what that could look like. Get in touch with us at <a href=\"https://getpackup.com/contact\">https://getpackup.com/contact</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for taking a look!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
