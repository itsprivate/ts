You both assume liability for the card and whenever it is charged, you guys get both charged automatically so you never have to ask to get reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p>We have had some validation on the product with some money and customers but would love to validate even more.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a roommate and think you would use this over Venmo, Cash App or Zelle please DM me and lets talk!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
