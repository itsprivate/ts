Just because a domain is expired, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s available right away. But still, I&#39;d like to keep my eye on them.</li>\n<li>Sometimes, it&#39;s just super interesting to see when some high profile names are available through obsecure TLDs (e.g. <a href=\"https://twitter.beauty\">twitter.beauty</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.accountant\">twitter.accountant</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.dealer\">twitter.dealer</a> domain names are available. What would happen if I buy them and do something with it. Twitter will probably come after me, but hey, it&#39;s an interesting thought. Maybe they&#39;ll buy them off? I don&#39;t know. What other high profile names are available through other TLDs?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a domainer and I&#39;ve been using Domainy to monitor and get alerted on domain names for above use cases.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
