The suggestions will learn what you buy often and help you a lot.</p>\n\n<p>You get the finance section, where you can track any expenses, and see who owes money to anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>You get a shared calendar, where you can add events, set reminders, and even adjust visibility. Never miss another event with your friends!</p>\n\n<p>You get the tasks section, where you can create and assign tasks, repeat them in any way you like, set reminders and collect points for completion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://get.ourflat-app.com?ref=reddit\">Try it out (iOS/Android)</a></p>\n\n<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated! We look forward to hearing from you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
