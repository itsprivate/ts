I had a simple and small goal, build things I wanna use and make $100/day. It started slow, I had started building and improving while traveling, it took a while but I crossed $100, then I crossed $200/day. Then pandemic hit and I went back to $100/day, but after 6 months and building a new microstartup, it slowly picked pace and again crossed $200/day then I crossed $300/day, now I&#39;m close to $400/day and my next goal is $500/day.</p>\n\n<p>If the momentum keeps up, I will hit $150K this year.</p>\n\n<p>AMA! üòä</p>\n\n<p>And if you wanna know the learning that I share, follow my journey on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1HaKr\">Twitter</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
