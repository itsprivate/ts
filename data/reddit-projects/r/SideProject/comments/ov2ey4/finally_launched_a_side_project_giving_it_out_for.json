I was always on the lookout for problems that I faced as a product marketer and wanted to solve them to get more business for my fellow marketers. One such problem I came across was I was not able to use the full power of so many social media channels to generate leads. I always had to spend hours monitoring 20+ social media channels to see if there are any discussions going on related to my product where I can jump and educate people and ask them to try my product.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I came to build this product called <a href=\"https://termmonitor.com/\">Term Monitor</a><br/>\nThe product leverages the power of social listening and notifies you when keywords related to your business are mentioned anywhere on 10+ channels like Reddit, product hunt, Twitter, hacker news, etc.<br/>\nExample of a Usecase: A logo design agency has keywords like &quot;logo&quot; &quot;need a logo&quot; &quot;Design a logo&quot; etc that are then fed into the term monitor platform (we also have intent-based search), the design agency is then notified over slack or email about those following keywords being mentioned on any channels. For example, if someone says &quot;I need a few logo design options for my startup&quot; the design agency can jump in on that convo and help the person with his requirement immediately. Thus getting a warm lead which gets converted real fast.</p>\n\n<p>Would really appreciate some feedback and help from a fellow business owner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S Giving 6 months free access to anyone who signs&#39;s up before 10th August</strong><br/>\nCan Sign up here <a href=\"https://termmonitor.com/sign-in\">Term Monitor Dashboard</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
