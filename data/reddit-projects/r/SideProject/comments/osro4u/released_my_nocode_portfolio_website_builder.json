Soon, creating and maintaining these websites from scratch was a pain so, I shifted to no-code tools.</p>\n\n<p>Having used almost all the no-code website builders, I noticed that; they were a lot difficult to use.You either had to watch a ton of tutorials to understand them or hire an expert to build a website for you. Both of which cost you time and money.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if you are not a designer or a coder, you will have to buy a website template, which again does not come cheap. And you will also have to pay the website builder&#39;s subscription charges.</p>\n\n<p>So I created Launchweb to tackle these problems.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First, our editor is simple to use. You need not watch any tutorials to understand it. You can directly jump in and start customizing your website.</li>\n<li>Instead of choosing a whole website template, Launchweb offers templates of different sections on a website. We have templates for ABOUT, PROJECTS, BLOGS, CONTACT US sections. You can use these templates as building blocks to create a unique portfolio. Kind of like lego ðŸ˜„</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Launchweb is currently in its initial stages, but it can do the job for you. I am constantly working on improving the user experience &amp; adding new features. I am also looking for alpha testers for feedback. So please do try it out and let me know what you think of it.</p>\n\n<p>P.S: I will be building this in public and will be sharing my journey on Twitter. So do give a follow if you are interested.(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zohaibsak\">https://twitter.com/zohaibsak</a>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
