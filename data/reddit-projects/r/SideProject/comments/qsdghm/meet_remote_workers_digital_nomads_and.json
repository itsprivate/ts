However, I couldn&#39;t find PMF, yet. So here&#39;s an update.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Pipewing.com v2 works</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#39;s a big world map and you place a pin in your location.</li>\n<li>You write a short introduction about yourself and add a booking link to your account. (E.g. from Calendly)</li>\n<li>If you on the world map mark someone as &quot;want to meet&quot;, that person can book a call with you.</li>\n<li>Likewise, you can book calls with people who want to meet you.</li>\n<li>That way, hopefully, digital nomads and other interesting people who are in the same region can connect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is still a hobby side project of mine, but there are already have a couple of hundred users onboard. If you have the time to give it a try and possibly the time to provide any kind of feedback, it would really help. Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
