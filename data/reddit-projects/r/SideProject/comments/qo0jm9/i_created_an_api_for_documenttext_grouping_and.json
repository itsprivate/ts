Essentially, you can send the text of multiple documents as a list and their respective ID to the API. The endpoint then returns the IDs for the various groups and their respective topic. Additionally, you can specify the desired number of groups or let the API calculate the best number of clusters.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the URL to the API:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://rapidapi.com/sneakyPad/api/text-grouping-and-topic-extraction/\">https://rapidapi.com/sneakyPad/api/text-grouping-and-topic-extraction/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can try it out for free!
