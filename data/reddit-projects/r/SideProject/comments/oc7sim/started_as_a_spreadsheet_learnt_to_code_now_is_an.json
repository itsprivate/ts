It is a way to quantify your life balance, make you aware of how you spend your time, in an attempt to motivate you to spend it in better, more productive, and more rewarding ways. </p>\n\n<p>To start with, I started time tracking my working hours with a spreadsheet, as I didn‚Äôt understand how people flippantly said they <strong>worked 60 hour weeks,</strong> and I was curious to see if I was any where near that. I then started tracking my time outside work and found it gave me real motivation and encouraged me to strive for more. I then built everyhour to make tracking easier and less time consuming. </p>\n\n<p>With everyhour, I have:</p>\n\n<p>üèÉcompleted an Ironman 70.3, </p>\n\n<p>üëã quit two unsatisfying jobs, </p>\n\n<p>üõñ became nomadic, </p>\n\n<p>But more importantly:</p>\n\n<p>üè† doubled the time I spend with my partner</p>\n\n<p>‚ÜòÔ∏è reduced the hours I hated by 70%</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Even if you just start recording in a spreadsheet like I did - just do it!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My journey to building it:</p>\n\n<p>Built a simple static page using html and css - put it on github who now host things for you for free</p>\n\n<p>Made a little JS file that converted a CSV file into a json for work</p>\n\n<p>Added JS to the static site</p>\n\n<p>Started playing with a react boiler plate demo app</p>\n\n<p>Experiemented with chrome extensions </p>\n\n<p>Found out about the MERN stack. </p>\n\n<p>Put 600 hours over two years on the MERN stack to build multiple apps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
