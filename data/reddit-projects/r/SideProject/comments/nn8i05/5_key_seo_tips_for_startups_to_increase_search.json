      "selftext": "There is certainly a lot of information online for SEO, and a large number of articles are solely promotional, shallow or straight-up wrong. This makes a startup founder’s dive into the muddy search engine optimization waters even more difficult, as it’s pretty difficult to distinguish the correct information that will help your business establish the right strategy from the get-go. That’s why we decided to detail some of the key opportunities that startups can use to increase their search engine ranking positions, generate more targeted traffic and obtain more customers in just a few easy steps. These 5 tips and tools for startups should be applicable to most industries and business models, however please take any generalized suggestions with a grain of salt, as SEO needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe are going to assume that you’ve already taken care of the fundamental on-page SEO aspects of your website and adequately optimized your content, keywords, meta-tags etc. There are numerous detailed on-page SEO checklists, guidelines and tutorials online, so we will not be covering these (although we will create a detailed article covering on-page optimization later).\n\nWith that being said, let’s jump into the 5 key SEO tips for startups to increase search visibility:\n\n1- Webmaster Tools and Search Console set-up\n\nWe will start the list with what should probably be considered SEO 102 and a requirement for every startup: integrating with the webmaster & search console panel of search engines.\n\nAdd your site to Google Search Console: [https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en)\n\nAdd your site to Bing Webmasters: [https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/add-and-verify-site-12184f8b](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/add-and-verify-site-12184f8b)\n\nTIP: You want to verify your domain on GSC both as a “Domain” property, as well as “URL Prefix” (which needs to be the exact URL HTTP(s)/WWW version of your website).\n\nHaving access to Google and Bing’s crawling information, automated reports, and issue reporting makes SEO considerably easier in the long run. Take the necessary time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard of both panels so you can efficiently take advantage of the data and features that search engines provide you within their individual platforms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2- Local search properties\n\nIf you have an online business, promoting it in your immediate local area is often the least of your concerns. However, this can result to be a mistake because having a properly optimized local presence can have long-term benefits, such as:\n\n* Increases your legitimacy, both in the eyes of your prospective customers as well as search engines\n* It helps your business show up in front of targeted, local search queries\n* Provides an efficient distribution channel for your immediate area\n\nAnd if this wasn’t enough, it’s completely free to establish a local search presence. \n\n[Create your Google My Business listing >>](https://support.google.com/business/answer/2911778)\n\n[Create your Bing Places For Business listing >>](https://www.bingplaces.com/)\n\nTIP: Create your GMB first, then you can import your business information to Bing Places.\n\nThe same on-page SEO principles apply to your GMB/Bing Places listings as well, where you need to optimize the content properly and business presence if you want to show up for targeted search queries. However, the added bonus of having a local search property means that Google will consider your proximity to the user as an added relevancy signal, thus showing your business higher than the competition.\n\nOptimizing your local search properties requires its own in-depth article to cover appropriately; however, we’ll list three key features that you need to keep in mind:\n\n* GMB site \n\nGoogle offers the possibility for GMB owners to create a simple web 2.0 website for their listing. It’s advisable to fill in the relevant business information and some content pertaining to your business alongside your main website link.\n\n* Publish posts often\n\nKeep your listing updated with relevant information that your customers want to know. If you are currently implementing a content strategy through your blog, you can publish your posts on GMB. \n\n* Attract (positive) reviews\n\nSocial proof is one of the most powerful buying motivators, and as it turns out, it affects your search engine rankings as well. Make sure you attract positive reviews from satisfied customers on your listing, and it will start ranking higher than the competition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3- Structured Data Implementation\n\nNow we’re starting to wander into more advanced territory, so if you’re not particularly tech-savvy, this might require some development help in terms of set-up. However if you’re doing SEO for tech startups, this should be right up your alley.\n\nStructured data is used by search engines to “understand” (parse & categorize) pages better and display rich snippets on search results. Why does your website need it? Your website may get featured in rich snippets and attract more visibility if it’s already ranking. However, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you will get better rankings from implementing it.\n\nThe official [schema.org](https://schema.org/) website lists all the different types of structured data that you can implement and provides examples for each one. Some of the most common schema markup types used for businesses are:\n\n[“Organization” Schema](https://schema.org/Organization)\n\n* [“Corporation” Schema](https://schema.org/Corporation)\n* [“Local Business” Schema](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness)\n* [“News/Media Organization” Schema ](https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization)\n\nThere is no “one size fits all” rule that can help you implement structured data on your website, as the markup type will depend on your business type, website structure, content strategy and overall SEO performance. Take the time to get well-acquainted with the various types of Schema and how to implement them accordingly on your website. Make sure you check out Google’s own [Structured Data Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) and Bing’s [Structured Data Markup documentation.](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/marking-up-your-site-with-structured-data-3a93e731)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n===Read the rest of the article on our blog:\n\n[https://outrank.website/blog/5-key-seo-tips-for-startups-to-increase-search-visibility/](https://outrank.website/blog/5-key-seo-tips-for-startups-to-increase-search-visibility/)",
