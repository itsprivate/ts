A user simply turns on the extension, hovers over a text element on a page, and clicks it to get all the information about it and save that info for later use.</p>\n\n<p>This can especially help developers, designers, and typographers when they want to get creative or simply when they&#39;re curious about a certain font.</p>\n\n<p>The actual Chrome extension is in development right now, so I&#39;m posting the landing page here to see if I can get any feedback on the product.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fontsnatcher-landing-page.vercel.app/\">https://fontsnatcher-landing-page.vercel.app/</a></p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to check out the landing page and comment below, Thanks~</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
