Accelerators are neat but expect you to go full time, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what I generally do... I find a project in one of those three situations, I take it off their hands (buy), try to grow it with my own team. Focusing on making it mostly automated (nothing truly is), providing strong semi-passive income.</p>\n\n<p>What I am looking for feedback on is how I could flip the paradigm. Partner with people that have a side project with promise. Then, work together to grow it to something that is a nice semi-passive income stream. Lastly, both benefitting from the sweat and success. </p>\n\n<p>DM or comment, love to understand your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
