  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been developing a side project for nearly 3 years and I don&#39;t have the resources to finish it and make profit from it. Any offer is welcome, as it&#39;s better to see it succeed than just letting it go.</p>\n\n<p>The application is a distributed storage solution with Java 11 + Spring 5 back-end and desktop agent, Angular 11 front-end. The code is 90% complete, in UAT phase, with good test coverage.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is that corporate laptops are running with a lot of empty space. By connecting those, your organization can gain petabytes of storage, depending on the number of employees. The app agents are running on them, when a file is uploaded to the server it distributes encrypted file fragments to the agents. Redundancy and hot/cold storage is configurable by the uploader.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m selling:\n- code base + documentation\n- .com domain\n- hand-drawn style product promotion video with professional voiceover</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the application: <a href=\"https://ph-files.imgix.net/db9a87a3-4179-4cae-993a-11301cb3df86.png?auto=format&amp;auto=compress&amp;codec=mozjpeg&amp;cs=strip\">screenshot</a></p>\n\n<p>Please only consider buying if you can manage the code yourself/hire 3rd party to do so. Message me for product video and other details.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
