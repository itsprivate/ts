I'm pretty honest with it and don't try to hide it so just thought I put it here in case anyone thinks I'm trying to do that.\n\nWebsite: [https://superpayit.com](https://superpayit.com)\n\nWhat: SuperPay is the fastest and simplest way to take one-time and recurring payments with zero technical knowledge. We serve more than 1,000 customers across the spectrum. From powering thousands of recurring payments for the oldest rugby clubs in Ireland to the hottest new no-code products to large enterprise accountancy firms SuperPay has proved to be an extremely robust and flexible platform for payments.\n\nWho's behind it: Currently we're a two many band myself ([@che\\_sampat](https://twitter.com/che_sampat)) and my dad. I manage dev, supports and ops, my dad takes care of business, legal. etc. But when required we bring in a experienced consultants/contractors to advise on certain topics and assist in some parts of the platform. The secret is to running a platform at this scale (and growing) is automation, automation, automation! Everything from deployment, testing, support, billing, marketing funnels, engagement funnels, is automated. That lets me focus on the product and when I do speak to customers I'm able to be extremely responsive and offer 10/10 support. See for [yourself](https://www.capterra.com/p/198637/SuperPay/reviews/).\n\nWhat does your stack look like:\n\n* Backend/frontend - Django\n* Queueing/caching - Redis/memcache\n* Hosting - Heroku\n* Support/engagement - Intercom\n* Monitoring - New Relic/Statuspage\n* Bug reporting - Sentry\n* Email - GSuite\n* Feedback - Canny\n* Reviews (incentivised) - Capterra\n* Git - Github\n\nOverall I would describe this tech stack as \"boring\". I consider that a good thing! By using tried and battle testing frameworks and platforms like Django and Heroku it means that I can spend my time focusing on my customers and building features that they actually want!\n\nOne way I decide on the product roadmap is by giving my customers a feedback portal where they can see upcoming features, propose new ones and vote for ones that they like the most. No more guesswork on what to improve or add next. You can find it here: [feedback.superpayit.com](https://feedback.superpayit.com).\n\nI highly recommend that you implement a feedback cycle into your own product, I was sceptical  at first  but after implementing it for more than 3-4 months I'll never go back. Here are some options that I can recommend:\n\n* Canny -[https://canny.io/](https://canny.io/) (this is the one I use)\n* Nolt - [https://nolt.io/](https://nolt.io/)\n* upvoty - [https://www.upvoty.com/](https://www.upvoty.com/)\n\nI'm sure you can tell, but this is my first type of post like this. I'll be writing more over the coming months showing more of how I run things and what I've learnt works for me and what really does not.\n\nHope you enjoyed it, follow me on Twitter for more - [@che\\_sampat](https://twitter.com/che_sampat)\n\nThanks!",
