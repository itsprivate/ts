That&#39;s what keeps me going :)</p>\n\n<p>The elephant in the room is that I feel like my UI/UX skills are not doing justice to the work needed for all the rest. So that will be my focus from now on.</p>\n\n<p>For those interested the tech stack I used was:</p>\n\n<p>React (JS), Javalin (Java) and MongoDB (Java driver). For the analytics I am using Google Analytics.</p>\n\n<p>I wish the best to the people who are working hard on their side projects!</p>\n\n<p>Oh also, everyone is welcome to use the site, not only Koreans living abroad :)</p>\n\n<p>Any comments/feedbacks/questions are much appreciated! Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
