Every week I create a digestible visual guide about fonts, marketing, and design ideas to help founders and markers step up their marketing and get creative. I have been working on this for about ~ 7 months. if you feel like checking out the newsletter, it&#39;s <a href=\"https://fonts.substack.com/\">here.</a></p>\n\n<p>I must admit, sometimes it&#39;s really hard to write consistently. This week I made it to the 33rd issue. After I sent out my newsletter on Tuesday, I realize it was featured on Product Hunt&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProductHunt/status/1428099405215899652\">twitter</a>. Getting this recognition made me smile all day yesterday. I enjoy my indie hacker journey, but sometimes it does get lonely. It was nice getting a little recognition and a pat on the shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>just wanted to tell everyone to keep going!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
