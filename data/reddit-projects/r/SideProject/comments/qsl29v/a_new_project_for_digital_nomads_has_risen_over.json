Building Remotely is an online book that will cover all essential parts of digital nomadism, remote work, and topics related to creating and managing remote businesses.</p>\n\n<p>So what’s so special about Building Remotely? Most importantly, this book was created by an entire community, not just one author. Everyone who has some experience with digital nomadism and remote work could help the writer perfect the book by sharing his life experience and all the good and bad things that came up during their nomadic life.</p>\n\n<p>Building Remotely is free and available for anyone to read online. Some chapters are already completed, but the job is far from over. In the very end, this is an ambitious project that aims to educate entrepreneurs that are not familiar with the concept of digital nomadism but want to embrace it and create a business based on it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think it could be beneficial to digital nomadism younglings and maybe even deliver a valuable tip or two for the business veterans in this field. If you are keen on helping the author out, please visit the <a href=\"https://buildingremotely.com/\">book&#39;s main page</a> and feel free to get in touch with him to share some feedback!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
