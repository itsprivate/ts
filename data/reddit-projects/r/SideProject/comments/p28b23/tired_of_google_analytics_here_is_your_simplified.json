Not from it outweighing the features of the  heavy-hitting analytics platforms but because of its  simplistic approach to the visitor data that it provides.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, NETSTATS allows free accounts with unlimited websites, serves up incredibly  straightforward data that is precisely the visitor data you want to see;  seriously, it&#39;s beautiful. Not to mention, you can toggle to real-time  mode and literally watch your traffic performance rolling by which is  great when running ad campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>While the free accounts are always welcome, paid upgrades are available based on your website traffic. The upgrades are reasonable and are not forced on  you. The overall platform is a breath of fresh air considering the  complex and bulky visitor statistic programs I have used and found all  over the web.</p>\n\n<p>Would love to know your feedback!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
