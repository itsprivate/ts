Would love to get some feedback from anyone that has the time to check it out! There is an option to sign in without signing up if you don&#39;t want to do an official log in.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>One question I have - do you think it would be a good idea to release on iOS before seeing the response when I officially release WaterMe on the PlayStore? I&#39;ve been holding back due to the fees associated with putting an app on the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>App Background:</p>\n\n<p>WaterMe - The Plant Care App is a helpful tool to make sure you never forget to care for your plants ever again! WaterMe was designed to be dynamic, so you can schedule or plan whatever you would like and it is designed for all plants! This includes house plants, bonsai, vegetable plants, succulents, aquatic plants, garden plants, and more! Feel free to track your paludarium, terrarium, vivarium, anything is possible with WaterMe!</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to check it out here:</p>\n\n<p>PlayStore:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waterme.app\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waterme.app</a></p>\n\n<p>App Store: Coming Soon!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
