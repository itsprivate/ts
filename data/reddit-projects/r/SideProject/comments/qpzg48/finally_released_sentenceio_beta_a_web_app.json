We want to make it a lot easier to create custom apps that are not built from cookie cutter templates but that are built from your ideas. Build a progressive web app - with responsive layouts, custom CSS style, easy app deployments, app analytics, and more. You can even create a component library to share your components with others - library names are limited so sign up now to reserve your names.</p>\n\n<p>We’re building something you’ll love and can’t wait to hear your feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://sentence.io/?utm=r2\">https://sentence.io/?utm=r2</a></p>\n\n<p>Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sentence\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sentence</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
