The main advantage of our solution is that they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>templates are easy to create and edit at üíØ;</li>\n<li>quickly customize to your corporate identity and company brand;</li>\n<li>generated for the format (üíª, üñ•, üì∫, üìü, etc.) of all well-known social networks and video hosting.<br/>\nIt is also convenient to make a whole bunch of videos using a prepared template by quickly replacing elements in the editor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We ask you to support usü§ùon the day of release on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/online-video-templates-by-pixiko-com\">ProductHunt</a> üí™ and leave a feedback or review about our service, cause we are very sensitive to changes in the editor and bring the level of service to the maximum.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
