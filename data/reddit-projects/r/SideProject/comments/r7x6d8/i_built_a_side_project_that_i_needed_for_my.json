Giving my readers info on upcoming trends just makes a lot of sense from a business opportunities perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is just something that not a lot of people are actually interested in. Personally, I&amp;#39;m really bullish on growing topics and meta trends. Also, some subreddits are so goddamn hilarious, you just gotta love to see them grow 😅 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short: I built exactly what I needed: a list of Reddit communities with a growth rate &amp;gt;40% in the past six months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this is something that you&amp;#39;re interested in, you can &lt;a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/explodingcommunities\"&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;. I give away a part of the list for free. Since I&amp;#39;ve been putting hundreds of hours into my newsletter without any monetization, I thought that the full list (600+) of fast growing communities could cover some of my costs. Hope you understand..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Anyone else who finds this stuff interesting or is that just me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
