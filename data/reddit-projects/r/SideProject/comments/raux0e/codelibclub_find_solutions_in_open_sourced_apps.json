For now, it&amp;#39;s just a fraction of the most popular javascript GitHub repos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://codelib.club\"&gt;https://codelib.club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this make sense? Does the CTA on the landing page make sense? How do you search code online? Would you use a tool like this or know a tool like this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback would be much appreciated.
