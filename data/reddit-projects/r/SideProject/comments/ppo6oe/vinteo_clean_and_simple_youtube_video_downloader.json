I was truly inspired by the amount of ad-infected, annoying, and obtrusive sites claiming to let you download Youtube videos for free, so I made one that just works. No ads or any b.s, just paste a Youtube link and it&#39;ll let you download it in all available resolutions for that video. The app also lets you download the audio for a video as well.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone interested, I&#39;m running a server with python that handles serving file content and putting high resolution streams together. Vanilla js and tailwind for the front-end.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vinteo.app\">https://vinteo.app</a></p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
