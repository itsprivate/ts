Cinevite is a simple app that lets you create event cards for movies and shows that can easily be shared on social. The idea is simple but it sure didn&#39;t start that way. Like the experience for a lot of folks over the past year - the pandemic, being at home all the time, and general malaise gave me a lot of space to conjure up something to do with my excessive free time. Of course I choose the most difficult thing - start my first business while working full time.</p>\n\n<p>At the start I had grand ideas. A 16 slide deck outlined my plans to create a platform that would transform the way people find and attend events (and watch parties) for movies and shows. It would change how people experiences movies. My platform would create a robust marketplace, partner with the major studios (watchout Netflix!) for content licensing, and save cinema - as ya&#39;ll might remember last year cinema (theaters in particular) looked like it needed a miracle to survive. And btw, I would get all that done in one year while working full time, having never built a mobile app or started a real business before.</p>\n\n<p>So I started building...and I built...and I built...and I built. From October of last year till June of this year, I was building that vision  with code and at the same time I started a newsletter to see if I could garner any interest into my core ideas around how people watch movies (spoiler - people weren&#39;t all that interested). I also registered an LLC. By the time I got to that point, I hit panic mode. I had built prototype code around a lot of the features I had in mind and had even gotten to an early working prototype of my original vision but looking at the pace it took me to get there, I knew it would take a substantial amount of time to get it done.</p>\n\n<p>I had to make a decision at that point - keep building or scale back. And if I scale back, what am I scaling back to? I figured it&#39;s probably better to get something out the door as quickly as possible. I also realized that MARKETING is the hardest part about this whole thing so I needed to shift focus to that. I quickly scaled back what I had in mind to the features you see in the cinevite app now at launch and I started inviting friends and acquaintances to beta test. I also figured that if I could find a way to monetize this most basic version, that would be a great way to validate if people find real value in what I&#39;m building.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, because of the pivot I&#39;ve left maybe 80% of the code I had written over the past year unused. But on the other side of that, after a full year dreaming, working, failing, and getting rejected from the app store (3 times!) I just launched my first mobile app! I&#39;ve started my first business, and made my first $3.50 (that 30% appstore cut is painful ain&#39;t it) from it! Where it goes from here...who&#39;s to say. My plan now is to jump heavy into marketing. I&#39;m also going to start a blog to help drive traffic to the app through content marketing. To be sure, I haven&#39;t abandoned the ideas I had at the start. My hope is to keeping building those features left behind into the app as time goes on while looking at if the app usage grows and if people find value in it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
