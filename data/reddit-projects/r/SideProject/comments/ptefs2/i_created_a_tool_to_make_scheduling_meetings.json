It was absolute hell coordinating interviews with my recruiter.</p>\n\n<p>Finding times that I’m available, relaying it back to her, her checking to see if the companies could get someone available for X day at Y time to do the interview, and multiplied by at least a dozen companies at one time.</p>\n\n<p>I created <a href=\"https://getschedulr.com/\">Schedulr</a>, a tool that saves time and the headache of back-and-forth emailing to coordinate times between you and someone you need to meet with.</p>\n\n<p>Schedulr allows you to import your calendars from Google, Outlook, and soon, iCloud to automatically find times you’re available to meet. Just send your link to anyone and they can schedule a meeting with you.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to a few friends and colleagues, they told me a tool like this would be extremely helpful for scheduling all different types of meetings, so I wanted to share it with the community here.</p>\n\n<p>I would love your feedback, as well as to discuss the pain points you face. Schedulr has a forever free plan, and I am giving away free premium licenses to the first 10 people who ask.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully Schedulr can be useful to you.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rlhh9kd2r3p71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aec25998ae5dc9ea6e56b728129580c3dfa06ac\">https://preview.redd.it/rlhh9kd2r3p71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aec25998ae5dc9ea6e56b728129580c3dfa06ac</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
