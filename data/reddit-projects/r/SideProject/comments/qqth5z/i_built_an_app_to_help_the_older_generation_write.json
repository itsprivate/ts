I built it to give the older generation an easy way to turn the events and stories of their life into a book they can share with family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>We have so much to learn from the older generation and it&#39;s unfortunate that much of this rich family history is told in passing but then slowly forgotten. Stories To Tell aims to remedy that by making life story writing easy, approachable and universal.</p>\n\n<p>I made it free because I think this is something that everyone should do at some point in their life. I&#39;ve had some ideas for a pro version to make it sustainable but for now I just want to get some feedback and make this version the best it can possibly be.</p>\n\n<p>So if any of you have grandparents who might want to do something like this, I&#39;d massively appreciate the share. But in the meantime, let me know what you think! Cheers :) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storiestotell.app\">storiestotell.app</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
