I hope this sub can benefit from it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The main reason I built it</strong> is because I would&#39;ve loved something like this when I started hacking together things and didn&#39;t know what to actually create.</p>\n\n<p>I use a pretty cool AI for generating ideas, then I hand-pick the interesting ones. Of course, nowadays AIs are not as good as in the movies, so the ideas are usually more fit to inspire or to help you associate and come up with a more advanced idea.</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s report (#23) got sent out a few hours ago, I&#39;ll share the complete list to help you get some ideas on what to expect from the newsletter (today&#39;s ideas were focused on chrome extensions, AI &amp; apps):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;1. A chrome extension for small business owners that uses AI to write their website copy and product descriptions.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;2. A chrome extension that recognizes bot accounts while you browse e.g Reddit, Instagram, etc.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;3. An app that allows people to create and share their bucket lists and others (like friends) can donate with a click of a button.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;4. An app that uses GPS to track your location and sends you a notification when you are near a place that has a high crime rate.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;5. An app that uses AI that lets you create a list of things (e.g projects) to be done, and it automatically breaks the tasks down into smaller tasks, making them easier to complete.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/octopyweb\">I also document my journey on twitter if you&#39;re interested</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to comment below and I&#39;ll answer!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
