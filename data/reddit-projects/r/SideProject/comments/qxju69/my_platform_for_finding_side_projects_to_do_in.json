You want to be part of a much bigger team, tackling bigger projects - ones that require more people to work together.</p>\n\n<p>I was in this position last year, and designed a platform which can list large scale ambitious projects designed for a large number of people spend 10-15 hours a week working on them. I&#39;m not just aiming this at entrepreneurs - I want to include regular people who might want to start a startup but don&#39;t want to quit the day job.</p>\n\n<p>So what do you guys think of collaborative side projects? I built my platform over the past year, <a href=\"https://www.sideteams.com\">www.sideteams.com</a>, and I believe it could work for <em>really</em> big projects. What do you guys think? And would any of you like to share your own projects or join any already listed?</p>\n\n<p>I think the key to Sideteams is inclusivity. I want to help people who might not have the time or means to start a side project themselves, but would like to. I also have charity and volunteering in mind - I did some market research and like 85% of my respondents said they&#39;d like to have something on the side up to 10-15 hours per week.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/95btiysbvk081.png?width=2202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae2167e24c88d813992fbcd6b27978ee3b94dbc6\">https://preview.redd.it/95btiysbvk081.png?width=2202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae2167e24c88d813992fbcd6b27978ee3b94dbc6</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
