Some of the potential negative outcomes of bots crawling a website are slowing down the server&#39;s response time, crashing a website, gathering data (scraping), generating unwanted fake user content, etc. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re a website owner you&#39;ll most likely want to know how protected your website is, or how effective your current protection solution is. If you don&#39;t own a website you may be curious about a certain site you frequent, or any website in particular. Either way, BMN works the same.</p>\n\n<p>How?</p>\n\n<p>It works, as I&#39;ve said, by running tests on your websites. After completing these tests, it informs you of your bot protection score and provides you with the evidence of testing done - you get screenshots, data gathered, and a list of requests and outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Interested?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I&#39;m developing BMN alongside my larger projects, and it&#39;s currently in the beta phase, so if you&#39;re interested in testing out its features free of charge, while providing honest feedback in return, head over to <a href=\"https://botmenot.com/beta-users-wanted/\">https://botmenot.com/beta-users-wanted/</a> and sign up! </p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or feedback feel free to ask/comment!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
