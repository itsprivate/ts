I always find them to either take too much time to use correctly or have too few features.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I built Weekrise. It combines a calendar and a to-do list into a simple interface. The app is intentionally simple without sacrificing useful features. That way, the time it takes to organize your tasks is as small as possible.</p>\n\n<p>It has built-in support for projects, repeating tasks, subtasks, multiple team members, backlogs, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Before building Weekrise I tried a bunch of task-management apps but struggled with most of them. Either they took too much time to organize well, or they didn&#39;t have the features I needed.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking for ideas and feedback, so please tell me what you think of it, either in the comments or by clicking the feedback button in Weekrise.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Weekrise is 100% free.
