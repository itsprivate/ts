Here I go, I am a 19-year-old university student that has been working on a side project idea over the summer: students do cheap labor in their fields/major for experience. Businesses/students can use this labor to do small tasks from cleaning to data analytics. I have created an MVP in flutter, but I keep chasing so many ideas and change my app constantly. I keep asking my business co-founder to find testers in order to determine the market for the app, but he is waiting on me to create a much better app. I have put too much time into this, but I do not want to keep putting in time if no one is interested. What should I do? I keep hearing conflicting advice like test the MVP, but if it is bad, they would bad-mouth it. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any advice in advance :&#39;)</p>\n\n<p>If you want to check out our &#39;landing/launch&#39; page:</p>\n\n<p>yab.mailchimpsites.com</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
