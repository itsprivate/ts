I browse posts on here regularly and am always blown away by what you people make. I&#39;m curious if folks are developers in their day job, or if anyone is self taught? Is it possible to learn and teach yourself enough to really make a robust, secure, and scalable project? I&#39;ve made some small side projects but I never see how to push them into the next stage because things get so complex. I think I also lack confidence because I&#39;m not an actual software engineer in my day job. Do you think it&#39;s necessary to have that type of experience to really create something well enough that it can ultimately be sold to customers?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
