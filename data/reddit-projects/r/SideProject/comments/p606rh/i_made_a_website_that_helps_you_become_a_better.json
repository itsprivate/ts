They often talk about skills like selling, public speaking, writing,..</p>\n\n<p>After reading one such twitter post a few months back I asked myself what‚Äôs the best way to improve writing?</p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly after some research, I found that daily practice in the first place. However, what‚Äôs in second place might surprise you. It‚Äôs having a Copy Buddy.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re like me this is where you tilt your head and ask: &quot;Wait what&#39;s a copy buddy?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain. A Copy buddy is a well-established practice in the world of copywriting courses. Essentially it‚Äôs an accountability partner. It‚Äôs someone with similar goals that joins you on your path to becoming a better writer.</p>\n\n<p>After doing all this research I wanted to get a copy buddy for myself. What I found was that there is no unified way of getting a copy buddy. Instead, it&#39;s a total mess. People search through fb groups, subreddits, and Twitter threads in search of a suitable partner.</p>\n\n<p>And that‚Äôs why I built HeyCopy (<a href=\"https://www.heycopy.io\">https://www.heycopy.io</a>). A curated community / portal where product builders and indie hackers who want to improve their writing can find a suitable copy buddy.</p>\n\n<p>HeyCopy is a place with:</p>\n\n<p>- alligned incentives,<br/>\n- matching based on goals and experiences,<br/>\n- vetting and curating of everyone that joins and<br/>\n- reviews that keep everyone honest.</p>\n\n<p>Check it out and let me know what you think. I&#39;ll be especially grateful if you share your thoughts on how I can make the project even better! üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
