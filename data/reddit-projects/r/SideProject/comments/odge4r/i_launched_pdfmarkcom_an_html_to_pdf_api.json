Programmers often need to generate PDF documents programmatically for things like invoice, tickets, reports, account statements etc. There are several free and paid libraries for generating PDFs but all have some quirks. The free ones are language specific, are not updated frequently and only provide basic functionality. Paid ones are too expensive and cost thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>PDFMark uses headless Chrome to generate PDF. For those who don&#39;t know, headless Chrome is essentially regular Chrome used programmatically. It is accessed via a library called Puppeteer which is written in NodeJS. PDFMark exposes a simple REST API which the developers can call from any programming language. The API takes care of all the hard part about generating PDF document from HTML or URL. It handles the headless Chrome and Puppeteer so that the end user can simply focus on their core application development and not worry about generating PDF documents.</p>\n\n<p>PDFMark not only generates PDF documents, but it also saves them on cloud and distributes it to the end user via a CDN.</p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://pdfmark.com\">pdfmark.com</a>. See the demo and sign up if you would like to use it in your projects.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
