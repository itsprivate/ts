I found that keeping everyone in sync with the latest versions of everything was challenging and often the client would comment on old assets and there wasn't an orderly way of getting feedback about what their favorite option was for a given round of images.\n\nSource Compare allows you to create items for each of your assets. For each round of assets, people can vote on their favorite iteration and that can be used for creating the next round of assets. It's easy to track how the assets are changing over time and it provides a single place that everyone can download the latest and greatest versions, so there isn't any confusion.\n\nIt's still in the MVP stage but you can create a free account and get started organizing your assets today. I'd love to hear what you all think!\n\nCheers!\n\nStephen",
