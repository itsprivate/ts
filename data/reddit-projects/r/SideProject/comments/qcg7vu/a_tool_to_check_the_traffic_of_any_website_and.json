The site is live on <a href=\"https://www.zavixs.com\">www.zavixs.com</a>  </p>\n\n<p>What is Zavixs?  </p>\n\n<p>Zavixs is a free tool that analyzes any website and displays data in a meaningful way. A way to see traffic data, ad revenue, worth of a website, and more.  </p>\n\n<p>Why did I create Zavixs?  </p>\n\n<p>At first, I was working on a much larger project that tackles a fine niche. I needed to do some research on how many visitors/pageviews my competitors receive and how much they can make from ad revenue. Some of the sites I was using accomplished this, but usually frustrated me in the end. Whether it was due to clunky outdated design, hidden behind a paywall, bloated with unrelated content, or just too complicated for my needs.   </p>\n\n<p>In the end, it&#39;s something I find personally useful and hopefully, everyone else does as well.  </p>\n\n<p>Please take a look and don&#39;t be hesitant to tell me what you like/dislike or how I can improve it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
