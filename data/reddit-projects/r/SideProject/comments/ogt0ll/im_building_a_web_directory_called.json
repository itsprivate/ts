Probably you will not understand what&#39;s inside unless you don&#39;t use google translate but it&#39;s not important. I want to share my feelings:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>İnternet Güzeldir means &quot;Internet is beautiful&quot; in Turkish. I love my domain name.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck market research</strong>, I want to build a thing that I want to.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck the income model,</strong> I want to build a thing that I want to.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck web2.0</strong>, I&#39;m selecting links by myself. The only option to add a link is a recommendation form.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck fancy frontend frameworks</strong>, I&#39;m using plain HTML and CSS. Because it&#39;s more fun for me.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck fancy design trends</strong>, I&#39;m designing it as a Dos program. Because I like that in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck fancy CMS systems</strong>, database technologies. Using a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mK5BycfvwvuPcekTKIMhPKtsRa0EXe-dGeQsvok5wz4/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/miratcan/internetguzeldir/blob/master/rebuild.py\">Python script</a> to build the whole website.</li>\n<li><strong>Fuck fancy server infrastructures,</strong> I&#39;m building a static website and hosting it on Github pages.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hope you all get the opportunity to build something you want the way you want it.</p>\n\n<p>Have a Nice Day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
