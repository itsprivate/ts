It&amp;#39;s in Polish so the audience isn&amp;#39;t international. And the competition is very dense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We knew from the beginning that SEO will be the most important source of users for our website. But SEO takes quite a lot of time before you see the results. You can see that on the chart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6vb3m6ja3q281.png?width=2318&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=90174d599fa012959fa8efa005d267a99e1a87bf\"&gt;This screenshot comes from my analytics app - Raport.pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The website is great in terms of speed according to PageSpeedInsights. You can check it out &lt;a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmemsekcja.pl%2F\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed us to rank quite good despite having little to none backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we are hundreds of thousands backlinks short compared to the biggest players. This doesn&amp;#39;t give us any chance to rank for most popular keywords. But we do get more and more traffic from long tail keywords and some from the brand name as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We managed to get backlinks from almost 150 domains. And the majority was just us posting links on different forums etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone starting with SEO I would higly recommend to go for long-tail keywords. Pay attention to your website&amp;#39;s performance on PageSpeedInsights. This really makes a huge difference. And also try to get as many backlinks as you can. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend buying links. But don&amp;#39;t neglect them as it&amp;#39;s basically impossible to rank if you don&amp;#39;t have any backlinks. That&amp;#39;s the harsh reality of SEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you hesitate whether to go for SEO or not - definitely do. We get around 75% of traffic from Google Search and another 2,2% from Bing Search. It&amp;#39;s worth the effort but requires patience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
