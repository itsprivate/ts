Then, around 12 months ago I started seeing how many people were selling Info Products, mostly curated Airtable databases on Product Hunt.</p>\n\n<p>The trend, was and is booming, and selling curated data or info based products is a LEGIT way of making some serious extra revenue while you sleep.</p>\n\n<p>So, I decided to build a <strong>purpose built all-in-one membership platform</strong> to let makers, educators &amp; curators sell secure, controlled access to their Airtable, Notion, Sheets etc databases.</p>\n\n<p>I soft launched <a href=\"https://www.paytable.io/\">www.paytable.io</a> in March this year, now I have 15 paying customers, 1 No 1 Product Of The Day from a Paytable seller, and have helped our users earn over 10k in sales!! I&#39;ve purposely created a free tier and help all of my users get their products setup and launch ready.   </p>\n\n<p>All you need is two things:</p>\n\n<p>- A great curated collections that can offer real value to people<br/>\n- An audience (or targeted Ad strategy)</p>\n\n<p>If you have a great idea for an Info product or already have some curated info that you know people will love then hopefully Paytable can take some of the hassle out of getting an MVP product out there!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, any questions feel free to reach out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
