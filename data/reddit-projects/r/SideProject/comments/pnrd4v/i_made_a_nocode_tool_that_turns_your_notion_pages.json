It&#39;s an amazing tool for storing and organizing all of my company&#39;s knowledge and documentation. After a while, I realized that I need something that I can expose to my customers. I didn&#39;t want to leave Notion. Furthermore, it should feel similiar to tools such as Intercom or Zendesk.  </p>\n\n<p>Since I couldn&#39;t find the right solution ‚Äì I built HelpKit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
