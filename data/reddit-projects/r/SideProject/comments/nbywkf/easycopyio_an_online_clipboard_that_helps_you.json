It makes it easy by making the share links human readable words like \"[easycopy.io/CleanWorkerHideKnow](https://easycopy.io/CleanWorkerHideKnow)\" or you can generate a QR code. So if you need to share something from your computer to your phone, your phone to your mom's computer, your phone to a coworker's phone, or whatever, it makes it as quick and easy as possible.\n\nIf you have apple gear, another way of looking at it is that it's like Apple's handoff/airdrop feature that helps share info between your devices except this one works across platforms.\n\nSome real questions are:\n\n1. Can you understand what the website does based on the description in the heading? \"Copy stuff to human readable urls or camera scannable QR codes\"\n2. Is it useful to you or know people who would find it useful?\n3. How could I spread this?\n\nMany thanks for any feedback!",
