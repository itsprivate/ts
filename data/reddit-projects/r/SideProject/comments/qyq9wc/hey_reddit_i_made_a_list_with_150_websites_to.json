But I always had a hard time with marketing and launches.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few weeks, I found several contents on where to launch a startup. But many of them were made several years ago, and many websites either no longer exist or are now requiring payment to launch your project.</p>\n\n<p>So I took the opportunity to invest this week (some 60+ hours with my cofounder) in creating this list with 150+ websites to launch your Startup. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#39;m using this list myself.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this provides you some value and if you have any ideas on how to improve it don&#39;t hesitate to comment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
