Influencers and brands can also carry out comprehensive competitor analysis on Predis to understand the kind of content that is working well for them.</p>\n\n<p>I basically divided this blog into 4 distinct sections:</p>\n\n<p>- Why we changed our target platform from Twitter to Instagram</p>\n\n<p>- How our Product Hunt launch fared (spoiler: not very well)</p>\n\n<p>- Our LTD offering on Pitchground</p>\n\n<p>- Key learnings from some user metrics</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the Medium blog <a href=\"https://medium.com/predisai/predis-ai-2-months-overview-apr-may-2021-db9180f711fd\">here</a>! Hoping this will provide useful insights to new founders about what to expect when at the helm of a SaaS.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck, side-hustlers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
