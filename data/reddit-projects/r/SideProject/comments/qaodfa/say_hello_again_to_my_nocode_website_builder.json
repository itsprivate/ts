I created this keeping an average internet user in mind. You need ZERO coding or design knowledge to create and launch your websites on Launchweb.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is Launchweb different from other website builders?</strong><br/>\nTraditional website builders work in either of the two ways: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They have a blank canvas, and users can create their websites from scratch.</li>\n<li>They provide a whole website template, which users can customize to their needs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The problem with the above points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For a website to look good, users must have a good idea of website layout, structure, and design. Users having no knowledge of design will find it tough to create a website from scratch.</li>\n<li>The problem of users going with using whole website templates is - sometimes you might like a few sections of one template and a few sections from other templates. But you have no way of combining these two templates.<br/>\nThe only way of doing that is through code, which again is difficult.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Launchweb solves the above two pain points</strong>. With Launchweb, users can choose templates of various sections used in a website (About, Blogs, Contact Us, Navigation Menu, Footers, etc). They can select these section templates, mix and match with other section templates, customize them and create their websites.</p>\n\n<p>Users can also use subdomains or custom domains to host their websites. It&#39;s a complete solution for anyone who wants to create a portfolio website but has no coding &amp; design knowledge. (Also working on Analytics).  </p>\n\n<p>And today, I am re-launching with a TON of new and useful features.</p>\n\n<p>âœ…Comes with a FREE plan. 90% of the features are free.</p>\n\n<p>âœ…Users can now play around with the editor without signing up.</p>\n\n<p>âœ…Custom Domains support with FREE SSL.</p>\n\n<p>âœ…Added a few more new &amp; awesome templates.</p>\n\n<p>ðŸŽ‰30% OFF on PRO Plans  </p>\n\n<p>Would love for you guys to check it out and maybe create that portfolio website you always wanted to. Excited to hear feedback from you all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
