Due to the principles of how our peer-to-peer platform was developed, people are making bets against each other, and not against the broker, so that the conflict of interests is eliminated.<br/>\n<strong>On-chain strategies (auto-following):</strong><br/>\nThe user can create a smart contract on our platform, then other users can follow his strategy and try to repeat his forecast with any amount of money. If the author&#39;s forecast strategy is correct, he gets his 20%.<br/>\nWe have created Value Network implementing QTUM Blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, and Chainlink as the oracle that predicts the prices. The smart contract has open-source code. The price oracle is assuring the user that we do not alter the prices during the bidding process.<br/>\nI will appreciate it if you support the Value Network project and upvote our product! ‚ù§Ô∏è  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Link on Product Hunt:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/value-network\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/value-network</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
