We made this to be a better way to search. It returns only pure organic results (no ads and reduces spam), let&#39;s you control how you see results with different views, has rich content, and keeps your searches anonymous and private.</p>\n\n<p>We just released a new alpha version for testing and it&#39;s got a new UI and a lot of features to make search safe and productive. It&#39;s called LazyWeb, and it&#39;s free and open to anyone.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lazyweb.ai\">https://lazyweb.ai</a></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re sharing it because it was a fun project to build, and while we made it for ourselves, we hope it&#39;s useful for other people too. Try it out. The feedback we&#39;re getting is that the search results are surprisingly great for a little project.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
