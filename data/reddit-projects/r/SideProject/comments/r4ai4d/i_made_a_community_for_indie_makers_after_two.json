I started hosting a monthly online zoom session for indie makers that eventually grew into something more. Now we have more than 2,000 members in our Slack, still do monthly meetups, and recently secured a bunch of partner benefits from companies like AWS and Stripe. I make some money from sponsorships and a paid membership tier.</p>\n\n<h1>The Community</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indieworldwide.co/\">Indie Worldwide</a> mostly lives on Slack. At least once a month we have a general meetup. We moved off of Zoom a while ago and now use Hopin. We also invite bootstrapped startup founders for live Q&amp;A sessions and have a podcast (of course). It&#39;s free to join.</p>\n\n<h1>How I built it</h1>\n\n<p>Just Zoom at first. I&#39;d collect registrations using an events tool called Mixily (which I also used to work for as a freelancer). Later on we added a Facebook group and then a Slack group. We have a website built using a framework called Gatsby, which is honestly overkill for what&#39;s mostly just a landing page. Hosting is free on GitHub pages.</p>\n\n<h1>Growing 400% in a year</h1>\n\n<p>This last year we went from about 400 members to now over 2,000 (counting by active Slack members). A lot of the growth came from a challenge we ran called <a href=\"https://100in100.co/\">100 users 100 days</a>. The idea of the challenge was to get 100 new paying users in 100 days, with a leaderboard and weekly mastermind sessions for accountability. Definitely hope to run another round of the challenge soon.</p>\n\n<h1>Making some money</h1>\n\n<p>We made some money this year for the first time, about $10,000 in total. Nowhere close to enough to go full time, but gives me hope this could be my full time job at some point!</p>\n\n<p>About 60% of the revenue came from Founders&#39; Club, which is the paid tier for Indie Worldwide. Founders&#39; Club is a lot like Lunchclub. We match you to other indie makers based on revenue and interests and then send out introductions once a week. There are currently about 60 members who&#39;ve paid between $60 and $120 to join.</p>\n\n<p>As of last week Founders&#39; Club also includes access to free resources from Strip, AWS, Mongo, Twilio, and more totally more than $30,000 in free benefits. I hope to add a lot more benefits over the next couple months.</p>\n\n<p>The other 40% came from sponsorships for the community and the 100 in 100 challenge. Sponsors pay to get their logo on our events and website. We also started a newsletter this month and sponsors can pay to include a short pitch for their service in the newsletter.</p>\n\n<h1>Plans for the future</h1>\n\n<p>Seeing the growth and making some profits this year make me want to try and turn this into a full-time endeavor. I want to improve the value of the paid-tier offering and figure out how to market it better. If we could get to a consistent $3,000/month I&#39;d be able to cover my living expenses fully and possibly quit my day-job as a freelance software engineer. If we grew the audience then I could also start charging sponsors more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
