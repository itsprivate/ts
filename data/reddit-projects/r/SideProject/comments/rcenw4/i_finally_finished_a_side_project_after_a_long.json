My motivation was really high and as usual 80% of the project was implemented really fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that initial push there was a bit of boring work left, like the whole bureaucracy stuff, which eventually lead me to abandon the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years the state of the project bugged me and I finally decided to finish it. I even reallized the last bit of work wasn&amp;#39;t that boring as I initially tought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m quite happy now to have finally reached a state where I consider the main goal as finished, but I&amp;#39;m curious whether any of you have made the same experiences, or what I&amp;#39;ve could have done to stay motivated in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in the whole dev stack:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Game is made with Unity game engine, currently released for Android only as I&amp;#39;m lacking a Mac (Gameplay footage: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0WAFlED06A\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0WAFlED06A&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Website is a made with plain bootstrap and a tiny bit of JS (&lt;a href=\"https://earthcrush2020.nimedia.rocks\"&gt;https://earthcrush2020.nimedia.rocks&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Score API is a PHP App (Zend Framework/Laminas) as it&amp;#39;s cheap to host and I already had experience with it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback is greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
