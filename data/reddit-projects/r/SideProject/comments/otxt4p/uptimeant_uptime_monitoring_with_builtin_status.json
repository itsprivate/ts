I needed something that met the following criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It had to send SMS alerts</li>\n<li>It had to respond to WordPress errors and other site page errors, and not just server issues</li>\n<li>It had to automatically generate a status page my customers could check on so my inbox didn&#39;t get flooded with &quot;is your website down or is it just me?&quot; emails. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, I couldn&#39;t find anything that met all the criteria so I built it myself. I ended up getting it to such a point in reliability and usability that I decided to open it up to the public and turn it into a little side business.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in knowing about downtime before your customers do, please <a href=\"https://uptimeant.com\">take a look at the site</a>. If you want to help me spread the word, then please visit my <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uptimeant\">product hunt launch page</a>. It comes with a 20% lifetime discount coupon.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time. If you have any questions I&#39;d be happy to answer them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
