Research shows that cell towers are expensive to construct and hold back the expansion of cellular networks to remote areas. Our solution is to use a tethered gas balloon to carry cell tower equipment to an altitude much higher than conventional cell towers. We have submitted a short <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVcI4OM8kFo\">video</a> to the competition that explains our side project idea.</p>\n\n<p>Please have a look and let us know your comments or suggestions on the feasibility of the idea. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
