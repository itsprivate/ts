It can also function as a news feed just to see what games have buzz currently, although right now it&#39;s just &#39;all time popular&#39;, not &#39;recent popular&#39; which is in the works.</p>\n\n<p>How it works:</p>\n\n<p>Anyone can post any game, any stage of dev, historical or current, and click tags to index it.  I aim to keep streamlining the tags to keep it intuitive to browse, although the tag cloud is starting to get a little crowded.  </p>\n\n<p>Permissions:</p>\n\n<p>A game owner can &#39;claim&#39; their game entry if someone else is doin it wrong and they want to take over.  Otherwise it&#39;s a FFA.</p>\n\n<p>Tech:</p>\n\n<p>All the game data is returned client side currently, which makes searching licketysplit fast.  But eventually I&#39;ll have to switch to cached serverside searches.  I might websocket the searches though to try to preserve the feel.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
