We cannot say exactly which cryptocurrency that will be, but there's very good odds that it will be Bitcoin. It is far from obvious whether cryptocurrency will be of any value within any of our lifetimes. Do not invest money that you will need in one year. Do not invest money that you will want within 10 years. Do invest money that you intend for your children and grandchildren to inherit. Do invest money in a variety of established cryptocurrencies. Do invest the majority in Bitcoin, the largest existing cryptocurrency.\n\n\nThere are a number of shills and get-rich-quick schemes out there and it's easy to categorize Bitcoin as one. The fundamental reasons for investing in Bitcoin are sound, but extremely long term. Just because you're right today doesn't mean you'll be paid tomorrow. Actively work against hype - it clouds our core message and investment theses. For Bitcoin to succeed we not only need to build the best Cryptocurrency, but also a community which is not culty and overly optimistic, but rather conservative, rational, and welcoming. This is a rare case where your own actions and attitude can affect the value of your investment. Take care.",
