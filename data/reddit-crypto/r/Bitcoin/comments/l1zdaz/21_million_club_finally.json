For those who may be interested and want to know how I did it, I want to share my journey to 1 Bitcoin.\n\nLike most of you, I started in 2017 during the bull run (around May).\n\nI started by buying $100 a Bitcoin which was around 0.05 Bitcoin. I wanted to make a quick buck and later on sold it for around $500. through to the end of 2017 invested I around $3000 into various alt coins and had almost no Bitcoin. It was alt season and money was made.\n\nI sold my whole position and cashed out my profits. I spent 2018-2019 on the sideline and just passively watched every few weeks.\n\n(BIGGEST LESSON) \nIt was 2019, I had nothing in crypto and I watched Bitcoin bottom at $3,000. At that time I had around $3,000 of savings and was waiting to buy, I thought it was going to go lower.... I was wrong, so wrong... \nI was greedy and wanted more, I thought I could sneak in a bit more than 1 Bitcoin but looking back now, not being in the market was dumb (A lesson for some)\n\nI watched Bitcoin smash past $6,000 and by Mid 2019, Bitcoin was around $9,000 and I chose to buy. I had around 0.3 Bitcoin at this point.\n\nI bought some more here and there and accumulated to 0.5 Bitcoin by around early 2020. I bought 0.2 Bitcoin during the March selloff and was flying high. I was eager to make the most of the dip even though there was mass fud.\n\nI thought I would trade and of course lost around 0.3 Bitcoin. Back to around 0.4Bitcoin.\nThis was hard for me to recover and it took me a while to move on as it was a large part of my portfolio.\n\nThe rest of 2020 was about accumulating and I managed to get around 0.6 Bitcoin by Sep 2020.\n\nAs Bitcoin rose quickly from Sep to Dec 2020, I was eager to hit 1 Bitcoin quickly and 2021 would be my year. I knew it would be almost impossible to just save so I decided to go all in.\n\nI had some gold and silver and decided to sell and convert to Bitcoin and got a bit more. I managed to find some extra funds and trade (don't trade and over leverage guys, I got lucky) abit to accumulate the remaining 0.4.\n\nI recently bought some more BTC today during this dip to finalise the deal!\n\n\n I'm glad to say I can join the club and I'll never go back!\n\nIt was a hell of a 3 year journey but if you persist, you can do it!!\n\nKeep stacking and believing cause if there's a will, there's a way!",
