I had 1 whole BTC (welcome to my DM, scammers). This is a lot of money for me, with my salary of $720/month.</p>\n\n<p>I have always believed that I am quite tech-savvy and have computer skills above the regular user. I was especially interested in security. I loved to climb in the settings, turn on all the security options EVERYWHERE, on the PC and phone - in all programs and applications.</p>\n\n<p>My computer was no exception, which at first was my working PC and then migrated to the basement, got a couple of cards and began to mine ETH.</p>\n\n<p>It all started that I downloaded a new version of the miner from a phishing site that was in the top in Google at my request.</p>\n\n<p>The miner mined as it should, but on the first launch, he injected an exploit into my PC (Windows 10) that gave an attacker access to Googgle Remote Desktop. And this is access to everything. This alone gave the hacker access to my entire electronic life. My Google account, passwords in Chrome. I EVEN MADE A QR RECOVERY SCREENSHOT OF Google Autenteficator AND IT SYNCHRONIZED WITH Google Photos.</p>\n\n<p>At 1 am I received two e-mails about the successful entry into my accounts in Binance and another local exchange in my country. But I have zeros in my accounts.</p>\n\n<p>My bitcoin was on my electrum, which was installed on the same PC. The only thing that saved me was that I put a password on my seed. BUT THIS PASSWORD WAS AMONG THE SAVED ON GOOGLE CHROME.</p>\n\n<p>An elementary substitution of each password from Chrome into electrum would give access to all my funds sooner or later.</p>\n\n<p>I must say that I did not immediately understand what was the matter. I reinstalled Windows but ran the same miner again, and everything was repeated. The problem was that the memory was clogged and I was losing the hashrate and I was looking for a problem in this.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, when I was sitting at the computer, I saw a standard notification by Chrome Remote YOUR COMPUTER IS CONTROLLED by [<a href=\"mailto:username@gmail.com\">username@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:username@gmail.com\">username@gmail.com</a>) (this was my personal account). I understood everything. I instantly transferred all my money via phone to another address in Samourai Wallet.</p>\n\n<p>And the next day I was already unpacking my new Trezor.</p>\n\n<p>I must say that I was quite negative about hardware wallets, thinking that I had enough skills to secure myself on my PC or phone.</p>\n\n<p>Now I advise everyone to have a hardware wallet.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL; TR: Hackers managed to hack me but failed to steal my bitcoins.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
