Used to have around 12 of em if i recall correctly. Total value at that time was under ten dollar. I lost interest and did not go to the effort to cash out. Don&amp;#39;t recall where the PC went, thought it long lost. When the crypto hype really started kicking of around two years ago, i used to joke to friends how i unwittingly threw away a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until last week... when we found a few pc&amp;#39;s from that era on my grandma&amp;#39;s attic. It is very likely that my pc from back then is one of em. I need to get some legacy hardware (IDE adapters and such) to check the harddrives, so i am not sure yet and wondering if it is worth the effort. Of course... if this BTC is still on that pc or otherwiser recoverable via clues ON that pc... it would be more than worth it to go to great lenghts to recover it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is, i do not know where to start. I have no idea what software i used for mining, if i used a wallet online or one on the pc... or maybe left it with the pool. Anyone willing to give me some tips on where to start? Most likely i left em in the pool... does that mean it is lost after these years?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
