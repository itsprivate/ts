I didn&#39;t realize it at first but there&#39;s a scammer with username @ intocryptoWerse who&#39;s using the same picture &amp; name but this handle @ intocryptoWerse which is just 1 letter different and scamming people.... I thought I was learning from a real guy and I made an account on an exchange he told me to go to legerxcoins.com &amp; deposited $3000 in BTC on the deposit address. Hasn&#39;t arrived and the guy says it&#39;s a server error and now wants me to message him on whatsapp. I&#39;m following along until now pretending like he isn&#39;t scamming. I&#39;ve tried posting on twitter &amp; warning but I follow like 20 people &amp; have 0 followers..... I only used it to see if I could make some money for the fam...... Sucks lol... 3K....
