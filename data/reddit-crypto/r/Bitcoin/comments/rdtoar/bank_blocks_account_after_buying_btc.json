This came just a few hours after purchasing bitcoin on cex.io. This is not the first time i bough btc there, but the total amount is rather small, about three hundred usd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I will have to go and talk to them, and they are asking for further personal documents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What strategy would be the best to use here? Thanks for the advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The bank is UniCredit and I cannot cancel it because my country pays out stipends only via this bank. Talk about monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
