Per my skeptical friend this is misleading.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says that “printed” does not mean “created.”  He says that printed more accurately means converting non physical cash into physical cash.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, some economists say this is a sign of a strengthening economy bc banks are responding to patrons desire for more cash to spend.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This last part seems highly debatable and dubious.  But I’d love some feedback on what Breedlove was actually saying.  Does “printed” mean “created” or only converted?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciate some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
