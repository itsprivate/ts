I&amp;#39;d like to hear the cons for doing so, so far what I&amp;#39;ve found is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The BTC you stake is locked up for 3 months and you can&amp;#39;t touch it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Not really a problem for me since I&amp;#39;m a long term holder anyways)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since my BTC is on crypto.com and no longer in my wallet, it&amp;#39;s not my keys and not my coin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Somehow crypto.com is a scam/and or they get hacked and I lose all my BTC that is staked&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Seems fairly unlikely to me as they are a decently big exchange with a lot of investments for their future)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC is not a Proof of Stake coin so I assume they convert my BTC to another coin, stake that for higher than 6.5%, convert back after 3 months and pocket the difference?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of you can clear my concerns up for me. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
