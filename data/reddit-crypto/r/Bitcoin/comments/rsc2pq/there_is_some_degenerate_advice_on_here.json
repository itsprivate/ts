Buy land, invest in a low cost index fund and Buy BTC.  This will probably get downvoted as it’s a BTC forum.  DCA what you can afford to lose but don’t become fiat broke with no other assets besides BTC.  It worked well for early participants but doesn’t mean it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
