  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if he can say these words and a central bankster can drink a glass of water at the same time? He speaks like a captured man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Key quote:  &lt;em&gt;“We layered over our digital money system about 40 years ago with money laundering and various sanctions and regimes around the globe; we layered that over a digital currency system called our banking system,” Gensler said. “In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote this paper in part as a reaction, an off-the-grid type of approach. It’s not surprising that there’s some competition that you and I don’t support but that’s trying to undermine that worldwide.&amp;quot;consensus.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-competes-with-the-us-banking-system-says-sec-chairman\"&gt;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-competes-with-the-us-banking-system-says-sec-chairman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW, Gensler can&amp;#39;t have it both ways, allowing a futures ETF, but drawing a line at Spot ETFs. Futures helps The Establishment Wall Street Traders manipulate the market, so he can&amp;#39;t turn around and say &amp;quot;I need protections for the little guy!&amp;quot; when he&amp;#39;s only taking care of the Wall Street players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d have some credibility if he didn&amp;#39;t allow any ETFs, but he has picked sides, picked winners and losers, and he&amp;#39;s on the wrong side of history.  He&amp;#39;s manipulating the system for Wall Street, not looking out for the average investor. He reeks of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And him calling the USD an asset is a joke! Either he thinks you&amp;#39;re an idiot, and don&amp;#39;t know the difference between currencies and assets, or he&amp;#39;s a corrupt liar. Pick one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
