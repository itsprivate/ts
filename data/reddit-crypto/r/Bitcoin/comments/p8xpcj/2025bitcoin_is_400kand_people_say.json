We could state that most cannot invest due to wages. FAIR point. However, I know tons of people who could invest-they have the disposable income. They don&#39;t want to. I repeat -they do NOT want to. They don&#39;t want to learn. They want to just roll with it. Maybe they put some money into what their advisor recommends. And why does he recommend it? His boss told him it&#39;s a good investment.</p>\n\n<p>If you are buying bitcoin, unless you are trying to be a quick trader (hint: most traders lose money), you have done something different. Bitcoin is not close to on the radar for most people. You have accepted volatility in exchange for a long term vision. Best of luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
