I dislike having strong opinions. I had learned earlier in life that if you have a strong opinion on something, you are already losing. There must be something you did not understand yet.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, I am pissed, because I want to find good and convincing contrarian views on Bitcoin. I have the feeling that all of the economists writing against Bitcoin are weak and mostly doing it just out of the blue: none really give signs of understanding the protocol. Arguments such &quot;naturally formed ponzi&quot;, &quot;tulip mania v2.0&quot;, &quot;deflationary=bad&quot;, &quot;infinite value? = scam&quot; and other analogies tend to be incomplete and always lack data or evidence. It just does not make the cut for me that you are a Nobel Prize if your text does not show that you invested the minimum time to understand the protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Krugman, Roubini, the dude of <a href=\"/r/CryptoReality\">r/CryptoReality</a>, they only have partially sensible arguments that they oversell as pure truth. And I need to be convinced it is better to be in the middle ground, I want go to the next page in my life. Aren&#39;t there better thinkers? C&#39;mon there must be provable facts against Bitcoin&#39;s monetization, right? Does anyone have any excellent contrarian texts to share?  I need to become a regular human again and stop thinking 24/7 about this unstoppable force.</p>\n\n<p>I am really pissed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
