Wikipedia is the only one that is authentic and indisputable. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are many different wikis... you have the Pokemon wiki, the Starcraft wiki, travel wikis, and even a wiki about bitcoin. These Wikis, as you might have guessed, are the Altcoins. They fulfil a particular function, they satisfy specific needs that are not relevant from an encyclopaedic point of view (knowing all the items in a video game, the places to visit in Thailand or any technical knowledge). These altcoins do not have a monetary function as powerful as bitcoin, just as wikis are not as encyclopaedic as Wikipedia. </p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia&#39;s hegemony as a repository of online knowledge is undeniable, being (in a sense) a consensus-based p2p network. No private company hiring top experts from all over the world can make a better encyclopaedia than Wikipedia. They have not been able to overcome the ability of millions of people around the world to selflessly contribute information.  </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if they succeeded, the content of this new encyclopaedia could become part of Wikipedia&#39;s content if it really adds value to what has already been written. </p>\n\n<p>Nobody believes that Wikipedia will disappear because of a better successor, as it is able to change and adapt. Just like Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the way I see it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
