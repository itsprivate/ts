All I did was save and invest in stocks and got nowhere. One day I was mad and went to my bank. Withdraw half of my savings and bought a few Bitcoins. At the time bitcoin was around $900 in 2017. This year I injured myself couldn&#39;t work for almost a year, still cant but am doing better though. My husband working but isn&#39;t enough. I knew I promised myself to HODL as long as but my family comes first. </p>\n\n<p>Today I cashed out some of my bitcoins, paid off my daughter&#39;s student loan, paid off my rest of house mortgage (65k ),  took my family to a luxury restaurant to celebrate.
