I don&#39;t qualify for a home mortgage loan because of my low paying job and subpar credit score. With the current price of bitcoin, I could sell all of my bitcoin and afford to buy a nice small house where I live, and I like the area where I live.</p>\n\n<p>If you were in my position, would you sell your bitcoin to buy a house right now? Or would you wait 4 more years?</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the price of bitcoin will be a lot higher in 4 years. So if I wait 4 more years, I believe I will be able to afford a nicer house and still have some bitcoin left over to save, but then I will be 40 years old, and I would also be stuck renting and living with roommates until 2026... I&#39;d hate to sell most of my bitcoin. But I&#39;d love to own a house.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so conflicted. I hate living with roommates and I&#39;ve always wanted to own a house, but I&#39;d hate to sell most of my bitcoin for only $62,000 each. I feel like they should be worth more and I think they will be worth a lot more in the future. Please give me advice and help me make a decision. What do you think I should do? What would you do?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that I was convicted of felony drug possession a long while back. Being a convicted felon has really limited my potential job prospects and made it a lot more difficult for me when trying to find a place to rent.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your input everyone. I&#39;ve decided to keep waiting. But if the price happens to reach $150k this bull run, I will go ahead and sell 1.5 BTC to buy a small condo, and then I probably will wait 8+ years before selling my condo and upgrading to a house. Otherwise I will wait 4 more years before selling some of my bitcoin to buy a house.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
