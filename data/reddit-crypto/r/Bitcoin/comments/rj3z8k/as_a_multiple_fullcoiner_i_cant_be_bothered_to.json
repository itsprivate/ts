In about 4 year I think my expenses will be just 1-2 million sats per month and by 2030 as low as 100.000 sats. There is even a good possibility that a whole coiner will get over 6 million sats in interest yearly by future institutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that my sats will last decades, even maybe forever I just can be bothered to work for some a-hole again. Instead I use the time to do what I want to, not what I have to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The daily stress is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
