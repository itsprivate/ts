We  went from a life where everything was easy to almost being in poverty. My mum kept things going by becoming a school cook to just scrape by on the mortgage. From this time, after my family life got turned upside down, I’ve always known that recessions cause wealth transfers. So as soon as covid hit I knew there was going to be another almighty wealth transfer so I decided to devote myself to understanding how to put my family onto the positive side of a wealth transfer, as opposed to the negative side like last time . First I discovered Gold but then, BAM, bitcoin slapped me hard round the face. I knew this was something special. We avoided gold like the plague (lukily as we would have lost money) and went hard into bitcoin as we need money to pay a 400k mortgage left after 2008. Well I’m pleased to say that bitcoin has saved us and we can now pay that mortgage. My 68 year old dad and 58 year old mum and are now hardcore believers. My mum even watches you tube videos on btc everyday 😂 we are still holding though as we have 4 years till it’s due. We are riding this bitch straight to 100k and I believe I will make my family millionaires rescuing them from years of struggle. Having learn about money and how shitty fiat is I believe I can become a millionaire, in the long term, by making sensible investments even on a modest income. The future belongs to those who can see it.",
