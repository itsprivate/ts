It’s simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.” </p>\n\n<p>“The essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war.” </p>\n\n<p>What a visionary. Its as if Ford was reincarnated as Satoshi to carry on his work with todays tech. Pretty amazing an industry giant of his time was thinking this way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
