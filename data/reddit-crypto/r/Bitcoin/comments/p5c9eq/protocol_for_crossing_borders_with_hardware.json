AES256-encrypted DMG images are pretty cool and might be useful for temp. seed phrase storage.</p>\n\n<p>Also you might want to research Steganography and secure memorable passwords.</p>\n\n<p>So curious what you guys think about this mental exercise:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On a machine with no internet connection create an encrypted, writable DMG (use a Mac VM / Bootable ubuntu usb if you are extra paranoid )</li>\n<li>Create memorable, but strong and long encryption key (password) for your DMG / image. This will be a weak link, so might get creative with it.Might use some combination of info on your ticket/etc that will be available to you after travel is done.Do not name the file MYCRYPTOKEYS.dmg</li>\n<li>Write your seed in a text file and put it inside the image</li>\n<li>Send it to your iCloud drive (or other cloud storage if you trust any) and log out. Best to use a &quot;burner&quot; cloud account, and not your usual one.</li>\n<li>Reset your hardware wallets.</li>\n<li>After you feel being safe again, immediately login to your cloud storage, restore hardware wallets from seed phrases and delete the image.</li>\n<li>For extra paranoid: send your crypto to a new address.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It takes a decade to crack the encrypted DMG.</p>\n\n<p><em>The reason it’s so slow is because your AES256-encrypted DMG uses 250,000  rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1 to generate the encryption key. The  ludicrous round count makes it extremely computationally expensive,  slowing down the HMAC-SHA1 process by a factor of 250,000.</em></p>\n\n<p>If you suspect someone has a possession of the file, send the crypto to the new address long before it can be cracked.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
