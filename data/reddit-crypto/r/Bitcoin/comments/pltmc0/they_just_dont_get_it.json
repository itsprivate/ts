Think you could buy lunch?”</p>\n\n<p>Really starting to realize no one outside of crypto will understand crypto until they start doing crypto. It’s not like the stock market where it has been established as generally a safer medium (which I can argue against that it’s not) to invest your money. So people are more inclined to test it out. I think mass adoption will really be slow for the general public as they will need to rewire their brains to the intricacies of the crypto market and that 20% dips are realy just “another Thursday”</p>\n\n<p>I try my best spreading knowledge on crypto to those around me but everyone looks at it as a taboo topic meant for kids and gamblers. </p>\n\n<p>So moving forward I’m just going to be playing dumb and act like I lost a lot of money so people can sympathize for me and continuously get me free lunch. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, that subway sandwhich my coworker got me was totally worth it :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
