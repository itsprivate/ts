Somewhere around this time, Max Keiser started his campaign 'Buy Silver crash J P Morgan.' That was enough for me and I was in. Me and millions of others bought physical silver, kilos of it in bars and coins. We then sat back and waited for the crash, it didn't happen. Why?, because J P Morgan got out of it's short position and that was that. They always will. They own wallstreet the media all of it.\n\nDuring this time I would be on ZH arguing against Bitcoin and for Silver. I was in IT my whole life, but just thought that Bitcoin was stupid. One day while having a major fall out with someone on ZH, I realised that I actually didn't know what I was talking about, and that I knew nothing about Bitcoin. And so I read the white paper. Before I had even finished reading it, I was converted. 20 mins later I was back on ZH saying just how wrong I had been.\n\nI started buying small amounts of Bitcoin in late 2016 early 2017. I bought all the way up to the top, and all the way back down again. DCA all the way. I sold my silver at at a loss, and put that money into Bitcoin. The best thing I ever did.\n\nI am writing this here as I have been trying to let people know that buying silver now is still a waste of money if you want to change the system. Bitcoin is the ONLY way this will happen. You have to separate the state from money creation. It's the only way that you can beat the system that has been evolved to not include you. Today I am still buying Bitcoin along with all my friends and some family. 99.9% of my wealth is in Bitcoin. I would never sell not if it went to -0. Long live Satoshi and coders that are making this happen. For everyone involved with it, even the ones I don't agree with. The common ground here is change, and complete and total change the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\nPS. I also run a full node on a dedicated machine :)",
