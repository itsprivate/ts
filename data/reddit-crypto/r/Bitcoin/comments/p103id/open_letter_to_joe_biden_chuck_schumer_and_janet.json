The “card trick” you just tried to play on cryptocurrency didn’t slip past the American people.  In the name of improving infrastructure, you tried to slip dozens of non-relevant regulations into the bill in order to further your control and tyranny.  One of which was a weak attempt to kill crypto, largely Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>As I type this message, we are pushing toward $46k/Bitcoin and have risen 7% in the last 12 hours after Chuck blocked senate voting on a critical amendment.  You see, you cannot kill Bitcoin.  You may slow down broader crypto industry growth on U.S. soil.  But Bitcoin itself is at a point where it cannot be stopped.  The more you try to block it, the stronger it will get. </p>\n\n<p>This “problem” that the Federal Reserve and Treasury now have on their hands was created in response to decades of mismanaged fiat currency, corrupt central banking, and Wall Street puppetry.  And now the problem you created is fighting back.</p>\n\n<p>Even if this bill passes in it’s current language, what you will see over the next 1-2 years before it becomes law is millions of people buying MORE Bitcoin, storing their coins privately, and “holding on for dear life”.  </p>\n\n<p>You can take our guns, you can take our freedoms, hell you can even imprison us or kill us.  But Bitcoin is the one thing that you will never be able to take.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
