  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Craig Wright&#39;s fraud continues. Yesterday, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SJpj0zj35zQ\">submitted into evidence</a> an email he says was from Dave Kleiman to Uyen Nguyen asking her to be a director of his &#39;bitcoin company&#39; in <strong>late 2012</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It is provably fake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Craig didn&#39;t realize that the email&#39;s PGP signature includes a signing timestamp along with the ID of the key used as metadata.</strong> Was the email actually sent <strong>in 2012</strong>? Let&#39;s find out!</p>\n\n<p>The beginning of the signature is as follows: iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTH+uQAAoJELiFsXrEW+0bCacH/3K</p>\n\n<p>Converted to hex, it&#39;s: 89 01 1c 04 01 01 02 00 06 05 02 <em>53 1f eb 90</em> 00 0a 09 10 <strong>b8 85 b1 7a c4 5b ed 1b</strong> 09 a7 07 ff 72</p>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880\">know</a> how to find the long ID of the key used and the timestamp of the signature. I&#39;ve bolded the ID and italicized the timestamp. Looking on the MIT keyserver, we can <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5ooGihN.png\">find the fake* key</a>. <strong>The timestamp of the signature is 1394600848, which is March 12, 2014, two weeks before Craig filed to install Uyen as a director of Dave&#39;s old company, and almost a year after Dave died!</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can double-check with gpg -vv<br/>\n. Transcribe the email and paste it in. Here&#39;s the output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:signature packet: algo 1, keyid B885B17AC45BED1B version 4, created 1394600848, md5len 0, sigclass 0x01 digest algo 2, begin of digest 09 a7 hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2014-03-12) subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID B885B17AC45BED1B) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(I&#39;ll note, as an aside, that Dave apparently spelled his name incorrectly and put a typo in the subject.)</p>\n\n<p>*The fake key has the same pref-hash-algos as Craig&#39;s fake keys, and were never updated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
