Luckily, a fellow traveler texted me to let me know she couldn’t contact me at all, not even receiving international calls because the phone is out of cash for roaming.</p>\n\n<p>I went onto bitrefill, chose Vietnam, her mobile provider, input her phone number and recharged her phone with 40k satoshi using Muun wallet. All within 2 minutes. I couldn’t have done this with my credit card because the Asian service provider wouldn’t have accepted my European credit card. I didn’t want to jump through their KYC hoops either. Didn’t have to with bitrefill.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you Bitcoin and lightning developers and community for making communication possible for me and my mom today!</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is for global citizens.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
