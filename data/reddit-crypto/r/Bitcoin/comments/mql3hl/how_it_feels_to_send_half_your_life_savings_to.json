  "selftext": "So story time: \n\nI've been researching interest generating platforms for my HODL savings and recently came to a decision to allocate a substantial chunk of my holdings to BlockFi (not really intending this post as a debate on the merits, lots of other posts on that topic...)\n\nSo anyway, I set up a new account, generate a deposit address, and open up Electrum, where I have the funds staged. Copy the deposit address from BlockFi noting, as ever, the ominous warning just below my deposit address QR-code along the lines of (paraphrasing) \"Hey dumbass, if you send coins to the wrong address, they're gone forever, got it?\". \n\nYes I've got it, not my first rodeo, but thank you BlockFi. I copy the address to my clipboard, paste it into the \"send\" field. I browse current transaction fees and settle on a speed I'm satisfied with. I hit send. I see a warning prompt telling me that the transaction fees are an unusually high percentage of the amount I'm sending. What's that? Oh, silly me, I entered the amount in mBTC (Electrum denominates balances and transactions in 1/1000ths of BTC, FYI). No sweat. I delete the transaction and start again. Right amount this time, copy, paste, quick eyeball scan from Chrome to Electrum to make sure everything matches. Send. \n\nThen I see something in the Electrum \"Outputs\" popup that makes my stomach drop through the floor. The address I see in front of me is totally different than my BlockFi deposit address. It's an address I've never seen before. \n\nMy body floods with adrenaline in an instant. I'm overcome with a dawning sense of horror. Did I just shred the countless sats I've worked so long and so hard to stack in an instant? Did I just light half my future on fire with a single click? I feel like vomiting. My hands are shaking. It's BTC. There's nothing to be done... no one to call. Someone somewhere just got the gift of a lifetime... or astronomically more probably its just gone. My mind grapples for an explanation...\n\n That's when my sickened sense of dread plunges even deeper, as I recall: I had been poking around the blockchain earlier today, looking at some activity of interesting addresses (I like to play with some on-chain data for analysis etc.). I realize I had been copying and pasting a bunch of foreign addresses in Chrome just a few hours earlier. What if I one of those addresses was still on my Mac clipboard and I pasted one of them into Electrum? As if some Whale with 20k+ coins needs mine too... \n\nAll of this is flying through my head at the speed of light, while my body is still being ravaged by coursing adrenaline and I'm imagining what my incredibly sweet but also incredibly crypto-skeptical father would say after haranguing me for years about how crazy it is to be your own custodian and how it will all end in tears... he's right. I think about how arrogant and self-satisfied I've sounded for the last x-years, telling everyone about how BTC is the future and patting myself on the back for my brilliant, brilliant insight and TeCHnoLoGIcaL GeNIus. I'm almost 31 and I just learned a child's lesson.... at a staggering, life-altering cost...\n\nAll of this transpires in the space of a few ragged breaths. As I gather myself, I start clicking through the Electrum interface in a mad frenzy, trying to make sense of what's happened. That's when I realize... My Electrum window is unusually small (I was looking at it side by size with my Chrome window) and it's placed near the edge of my Macbook screen so it's a bit clipped and the content is wrapping. I'm looking at the CHANGE address, and as I shift and resize the window I see that a small amount of BTC has moved to one of MY addresses WAY down my address list (the change), and that the main transaction has gone to the address I intended. A short while later I get an email ping from BlockFi telling me I have a pending deposit. I exhale, and get up to go change my underwear.",
