Before going down the rabbit hole, I never realized how f*cked up the system really is.  Bitcoin&#39;s value, for me, is no longer monetary. It&#39;s value rests on all the knowledge I&#39;ve acquired, which is priceless.  The governments can ban bitcoin all they want.  They can take from us what they wish but they will never be able to take what we&#39;ve learned.  This statement goes beyond bitcoin and it&#39;s been a good way for me to maintain my serenity through the ups and downs of this market.  Best of wishes to you all and keep on HODLing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
