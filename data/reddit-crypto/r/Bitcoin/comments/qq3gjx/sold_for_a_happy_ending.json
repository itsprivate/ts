Well, we purchased $30k worth of bitcoin (at around 45k each) hoping to sell it all for $40k total(gain of $10k). We hit our goal during the rise last week but we were both busy working at the time and couldn&#39;t talk about our exit strategy. Last time we were talking about bitcoin over dinner, and I said &quot;You know, btc is close to 68&quot; and the look on her face lit up and she said &quot;So we made it???&quot; I showed her my account and it was now at $45,300. I hit sell all. Gain of +$15,300 8n a few months. Not bas for a newly wed 28 year old couple. Now we have an extra $45k in the bank on top of our regular savings. I plan on reinvestong the gains of 15k back into btc and using the 30k to help pay off our mortgage. We hugged and said &quot;We made it! $45 thousand dollars!&quot; and my 9 year old daughter sitting there says &quot;How did you guys just win $45,000?&quot; &quot;well honey, you know that thing called bitcoin I&#39;ve been talking about for a couple years now?&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
