Just thought I'd share it here so newcomers can see how I used DCA strategy to invest in Bitcoin monthly  over the last 8 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a taxi driver in a European city and in December 2012 I picked up an American customer who wanted to go to the airport. The traffic was chaotic and what would usually be a 30 min journey, took approx 90 min. He was cool with it though, as he had plenty of time for his flight.\n\nWe had a really good chat, he told me about BTC and how even if I didn't want to put money into it, it was important to know what it was. Needless to say, I was intrigued, and a bit confused. Over the next ten days or so, I read as much online as I could and decided there and then that I would quit my 15 cigarettes a day habit and put the money I would have spent otherwise into BTC. I made my first purchase of BTC on Jan 1st, 2013.\n\nEvery month for the last 8 years, I have bought €250 of BTC. I was DCAing without even realising it was an actual strategy. I am still buying at today's price, and have bought at every price range since 2013. I have never sold any of it.\n\nNeedless to say, my financial and physical health have drastically changed since then and I truly believe that BTC has saved my life. My initial plan was to DCA for 10 years, and if I have enough to retire, then I will, that's less than 2 years away now and will be 1 month before my 40th birthday.\n\nI have well over 7 figures in BTC, yet still drive my taxi everyday. Life is good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add in that Bitcoin gave me an incentive to quit smoking, and that's as valuable to me as the gains I've made. That's why I feel it saved my life.",
