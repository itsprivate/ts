Way before we announced our plan to make Bitcoin legal tender, we have had amazing talent from overseas working tirelessly to make this happen. They are not here for money, but idealists who want to make a difference, to make the lives of the people better who need it most.</p>\n\n<p>(About IMF concern) We adopted the dollar in 2001. This is no different. The only difference is we adopted the dollar for the benefit of our banks. This is for the benefit of our people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
