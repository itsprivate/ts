But I did read the rules.<br/>\nI&#39;m not an &quot;internet guy&quot;, my son showed me Reddit some time ago. I didn&#39;t give much attention to it, it&#39;s not my kind of thing. Today I opened it again and found out there is a community here about Bitcoin.  </p>\n\n<p>My story is that I &quot;bought&quot; it when it was cheap in 2013. I was selling my car to a friend of mine, he didn&#39;t have all the money to buy it, just a part of it. He asked me to split the amount in installments. I declined, I don&#39;t like installments. Then he asked if he could pay for the rest of the value with his Bitcoins.  </p>\n\n<p>He explained for a long time what it was, and why it worked like money. At first, I didn&#39;t like the idea. But I wasn&#39;t needing all the money at that time, and he said he could buy it back. So we did it.  </p>\n\n<p>He teached me to use it though I didn&#39;t really used it for a long time. It was just sitting there. Of course I heard the news that it was getting value. This same friend told me to buy a physical wallet to hold it. He said it was more safe, and I agree. I also like to have something that is not just in my computer.  </p>\n\n<p>In the last years, I retired earlier. Every month I sell some of my Bitcoins to this same friend. Not any insane amount, just what I need for my family expenses etc. And sometimes some more when I need to buy something new.  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t live a live of luxuries. I have a good house, a good car. I pay for my children college and school and we do some family travels together. And I guaranteed they have a house to live. That&#39;s enough for me  </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it, I&#39;m not in any Bitcoin related community or discussion. I don&#39;t know how it works. My friend tried to explain me a lot of times. I know enough about it to use all these years. I know how to send, how to receive and I have my pass phrase in a paper well hidden.  </p>\n\n<p>I read about how you guys buy and sell it all the time. I&#39;m not any specialist and I might be wrong. But maybe you just need a little more patience. It took a long time for my Bitcoins to be worth something.  </p>\n\n<p>Excuse me if I don&#39;t reply you. As I said, I don&#39;t really use Reddit<br/>\nAlso excuse me if I made any grammatical errors, english is not my first language and I don&#39;t live in an english speaking country.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
