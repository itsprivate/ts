I wrote a “noob friendly” 6 minute article summarizing my 100 hour of learning about bitcoin and send it to him and other friends. He is not interested.</p>\n\n<p>He doesn’t see why I get so excited about dozens of words that I shared with him offline nor understand why I even want to bother guarding my own private keys. He shares articles about Tether not keeping 1:1 dollar reserves in their book but doesn’t get that the reserve requirement is 0% for US banks after March 2020 (this used to be 10%).</p>\n\n<p>Mind you, he is a smart person, a successful dev who is interested in investing. Sadly, most of our bitcoin conversations hit a brick wall and I finally gave up.</p>\n\n<p>I guess this is why I am on Reddit. Rant complete.</p>\n\n<p>Update 1: Many commented that (s)he’d like to read the article. It’s in very simple language and covers the basic only, probably something you already know <a href=\"https://hannahdo.medium.com/a-summary-from-my-100-hours-of-learning-about-bitcoin-9d6da7b8feea\">https://hannahdo.medium.com/a-summary-from-my-100-hours-of-learning-about-bitcoin-9d6da7b8feea</a></p>\n\n<p>Update 2: No, I am not planning to change bf, I respect him immensely in many other area of life except for bitcoin. I also share my private keys with him. This is only to highlight that there are also women out there who are interested in investment and bitcoin, and not all men are interested in it. Maybe one day, but not yet.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
