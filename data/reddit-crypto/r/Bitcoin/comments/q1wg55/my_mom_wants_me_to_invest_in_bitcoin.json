Should I tech her how to do it herself or do it for her?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks everyone, really valuable perspectives and inputs. I will continue helping her educate herself and buy on her behalf for the moment, hoping to transfer to her own cold wallet one day when she’ll feel ready to self custody.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
