Then, on November 29th and November 30th, I wanted to rebalance my allocations to 75% (mostly BTC) and 25% stocks, so this is very close to &amp;quot;going all-in&amp;quot; at around 60k per BTC. I moved a total of $70k USD from stocks to crypto between those two days. Fast forward to today, my crypto holdings are down 28k USD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does it feel? Fine. I haven&amp;#39;t sold, and therefore I haven&amp;#39;t lost. Will I sell? Not a chance, even if BTC drops to 8k per coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I recover? By DCA&amp;#39;ing. Each time I will deposit more fiat into crypto, I will be lowering my average cost per share. Then when Bitcoin inevitably reaches a new ATH, my gains will be even higher than if ATH happened today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story? There&amp;#39;s no reason to panic unless you sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
