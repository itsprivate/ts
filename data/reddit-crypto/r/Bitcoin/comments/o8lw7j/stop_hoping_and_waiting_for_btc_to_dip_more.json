Wouldn’t you rather have everyone going in now, in the low-to-mid $30,000s and just keep buying as it continues to stay sideways or go up? When we start hitting all-time highs, are you really going to care that you bought at $25k vs $30k?</p>\n\n<p>$65k to $30k is the dip. Start buying and stop talking about the hypothetical lower price you’re going to buy at. Some broken record advice… DCA. Invest 1/52nd of what you want to invest in total every week. And if that dip comes that you’ve been waiting for… stop the DCA strategy and and back up the truck to buy as much as you want. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>steps off soapbox</em></strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
