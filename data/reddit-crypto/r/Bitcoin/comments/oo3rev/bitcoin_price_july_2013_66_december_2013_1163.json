I will not overcomplicate this post and you don&#39;t need to be a TA expert to understand it.</p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what&#39;s referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), aren&#39;t limited to TA, but ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.</p>\n\n<p>Fans of The Da Vinci Code will remember Professor Langton explaining how mathematics and art collide via the &#39;golden ratio.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>The golden ratio is sometimes called the &quot;divine proportion,&quot; because of its frequency in the natural world. Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Golden Ratio in Bitcoin</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin&#39;s price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and 2017. Let&#39;s take a look. These charts are very easy to follow,</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/btz4233otdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e202930c48f7ed3ac3e6a9c200fe3b47e3960f2\">First big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 (2011-2013)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0a89pscutdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcf184dc809a8695e9202ff0749e9f92233ca02\">Same pattern (2013-2017)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w443ztdxtdc71.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4d1b5aeb6c793e396a177e9b95959452859c58\">Unerringly rhythmical (2017-2021)</a></p>\n\n<p>When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn&#39;t kidding. Whatever makes the price action so unerringly rhythmical this way between halving cycles can be empirically analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.</p>\n\n<p>It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.</p>\n\n<p>I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way (so far) is nothing short of spine-chilling.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the two pinned posts on my profile.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Back then, I hadn&#39;t yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the quadrennial cycles.</p>\n\n<p>Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to my prediction in 2018, I understand that this may be too optimistic to imagine right at this moment.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal opinion, it&#39;s very likely that 29k turns out to be the bottom for this correction phase.</p>\n\n<p>But you should of course DYOR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
