I&amp;#39;m buying every month and updating the charts. I kinda had a vision I will stack myself to million dollars (and euros eventually). The longer my journey has been, the more realistic this aim is getting. I&amp;#39;m documenting this stuff in this blog. Hope it will give you inspiration to do something similar. Don&amp;#39;t feel depressed if you &amp;#39;cannot get a full coin&amp;#39; or some other amount of Bitcoin because &amp;#39;the price is already too high&amp;#39;. I can tell you I wanted to have 10 coins (in 2017) but I immediately realised its gonna be impossible with my salary. So what? I started stacking the best I can. You can stack the best you can. The outcome will always be better than if you never start stacking. Love yourself, stack some sats!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-17-december-2021/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-17-december-2021/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
