This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills.

An intern answering your call will add a tally to &quot;support this amendment to this act&quot; to the call report that is sent to the congressional leader and their staffers. It is an email containing numbers of how many people called about what. We can really work together to make this staggering.</p>\n\n<p>True, there may be some senators that are being disgustingly lobbied out of their decisions. But there are also those who are genuinely interested/confused on cryptocurrency and this shows them the general public consensus to support.</p>\n\n<p>You can literally call/email every week on repeat, it goes on a fresh new report each week. Please help in making this work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
