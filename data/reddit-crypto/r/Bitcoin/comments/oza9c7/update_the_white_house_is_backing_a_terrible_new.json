The original bill submitted by Senators Portman and Sinema was terrible, and enabled mass-surveillance of the entire crypto-economy.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis introduced an amendment that would fix the language and clarify that the expansion of the definition of a “broker” doesn’t apply to open source software developers or validators like miners or stakers.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, last night Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema introduced a separate amendment that would make the original bill even worse! The White House has come out in support of this bad amendment, and many within the senate are hailing is as a &quot;compromise&quot;, but in reality it&#39;s even worse than the original bill. Their amendment would kill off PoS validators, DEXs, DeFi, &amp; many other entities in the crypto-economy. Don&#39;t let this sneak attack slip through!</p>\n\n<p>Check out this thread for a more detailed overview: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1423653963191230471\">https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1423653963191230471</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>We must tell our senators to vote NO on the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment and vote YES on the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If you haven&#39;t called yet, do it now.</strong> <strong>If you already called in support of the Wyden amendment, CALL AGAIN to tell your Senators to REJECT the Warner amendment!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Call your Senators right now at 517-200-9518. We&#39;ll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>When a staff member answers, tell them:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support the Wyden-Toomey-Lummis amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684) . This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. I also ask that you vote NO on the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment, which is being described as a compromise but would be a disaster for the technology. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
