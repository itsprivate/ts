I’ve been here for a few years and just want to say I’ve stopped looking at the charts, I don’t care about the price and I feel so confident that we’re heading in the right direction that I just don’t care about the small moves anymore. I’ve put a LOT of money into this now, more than I dare say a lot of you guys, but I just  ant to help anyone that feels they got here late, or putting more than they think they should, that there’s people here with so much on the line that you should feel confident in your investment no matter how big or small. Remember that you’re in it for the long haul, forget small term moves, but never forget in a world that is becoming more and more authoritarian by the day that you now own a piece of nascent currency that answerers to no one.

Peace x</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
