  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiat currency banking system is doomed to fail because most all new money is created as debt; only backed by a banks promise to pay it back. In other words, backed by nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banks make money by lending. But banks don&amp;#39;t actually lend money they have. Instead, they &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; it by writing it into borrowers accounts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever we take out a loan, we are led to believe that we&amp;#39;ve received money from someone else&amp;#39;s deposits. The reality is that the bank actually just wires you the amount it has promised to owe you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the real world, the lender must have something to lend. If you need a hammer, my written promise to provide a hammer I don&amp;#39;t have will be of no use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the magical world of money, &lt;strong&gt;a banks written promise to provide you money it doesn&amp;#39;t have is allowed to be passed off as money&lt;/strong&gt;. 95% - 99% of money exists this way; as digits on bank accounts representing debt owed by the bank to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEBT = MONEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not even the worst part. This system is doomed to fail because the debt is perpetual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, banks only create the principle of the loans that they lend, not the interest. &lt;strong&gt;This means there will always be more debt than money&lt;/strong&gt;.  The money needed to pay back the interest accumulated on a loan doesn&amp;#39;t exist. So the only way the interest can be paid back is by taking on even more debt, which just kicks the can down the road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite literally a scheme. Banks are parasites. They want more money than there even is money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Bitcoin/crypto can be the quickest path for the general public to take and ditch this system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not going to pretend that Bitcoin will solve everything. But it does solve a lot and now I finally understand why it is better than fiat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever in a very long time, we have a currency that is not in control of any authority. A currency that can be sent between each other without a third party. A currency that does not require a private bank to issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s revolutionary. It has the power to change the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But time will tell whether or not the people catch on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
