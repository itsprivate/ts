Hope you get some motivation of my writings as I document my journey of buying Bitcoin every month. Its not an instawealth story. Don&#39;t feel sorry for not having a large amount of Bitcoin. Do what you can to increase your ability to keep buying month after month, dip after dip, ATH after ATH. Keep at it for many many months. It will be worth it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com\">https://er-bybitcoin.com</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
