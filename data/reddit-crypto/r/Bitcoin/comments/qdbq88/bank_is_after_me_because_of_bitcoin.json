All my info, holdings, personal number, phone number, address will show up.. they are gonna close both business and private accounts, setting me in a terrible position. I’ve called another bank and they told me that they only want to know my holdings. But I don’t feel like giving it to them, but they don’t understand what risk involved with those informations.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
