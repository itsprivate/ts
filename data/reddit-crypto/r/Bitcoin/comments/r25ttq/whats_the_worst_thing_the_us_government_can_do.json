Let&#39;s say bitcoin is a big threat to the dollar&#39;s status as a reserve currency, what is the worst case realistic scenario? Let&#39;s not discuss &quot;US government waltzes into your homes and takes your hardware wallet&quot; because that&#39;s not a realistic scenario. If we reach that point, we have much bigger problems.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can see, they&#39;ve already done the worst and it&#39;s set capital gains against purchases by bitcoins. No one in the US wants to pay capital gains every time you buy something, most people don&#39;t want to fight the federal government believe it or not. This is fine with me, because it still allows bitcoin to be an asset class.</p>\n\n<p>With how many billionaires, institutions, giant companies, jobs now revolve around bitcoin and crypto, could anything else harmful really be done? I doubt very much anyone in the US govt would want to rock the boat much at this point when their major donors and friends  are becoming invested.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
