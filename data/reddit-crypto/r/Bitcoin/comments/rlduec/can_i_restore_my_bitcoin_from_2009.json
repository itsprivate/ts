  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys I have a question that I am sure must of been asked hundreds of times before...here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2009 I was really interested in anything related to economics and specifically currency. I came across the whitepaper for bitcoin and after doing some reading, I decided to download the bitcoin client. I remember I was mining for weeks on end not really knowing the significance of what I was doing but was just really trying to support the idea of a virtual currency as I knew this could be the future. Around 2010 I threw my computer and all my furniture in storage and moved overseas. My computer has been sitting in storage for about 11 years now and I am going back soon to open it up and see if I still have the bitcoin client. I am not really in sync with how bitcoin operates nowadays, all i know is you either have your private keys in cold storage or hot storage. I think in 2009 my computer should hold the private keys on cold storage as there weren&amp;#39;t any virtual wallets back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I go back soon, I will attempt to recover my potential riches or perhaps cry in despair so...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)What is the name of the bitcoin client that was operating in 2009? I only ask this because I tried to go to the bitcoin website and it says I need to log in. There were no accounts back then, it was just a client on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)In the case that I formatted my computer (which i do not recall if i did or not), can I get my hard drive professionally restored saving my potential private keys to restore my coins? (I heard its an expensive process but with the use of magnets or something, you can restore your hard drive even if formatted)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I had a powerful graphics card in 2009, how many bitcoins can someone have mined in 2009 per day given the low amount of mining back then with a top of the line video card? ( I was mining every day for maybe a few weeks or a month)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
