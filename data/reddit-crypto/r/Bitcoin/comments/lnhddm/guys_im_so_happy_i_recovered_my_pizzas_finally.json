I looked for about 3 hours in there and finally found what might be 3 pizzas, I couldn't really tell but I also found a google doc on how to recover my pizzas.  I tried all night but couldn't remember my password, but then I called a pizza recovery service near me, and the guy was totally cool and used brute force password tech to recover my pizzas, I had to give him half of my pizzas but man was it worth it, I'm living large now with 1.5 pizzas .  I think I will just hodl them for awhile till I can talk to my tax guy as see what's up.  Just wanted to share this story about my pizzas.
