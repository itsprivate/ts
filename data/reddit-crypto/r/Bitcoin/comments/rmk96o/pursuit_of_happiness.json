I got around 400% profit which is so far the biggest return in any of my investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the amount came in my bank account and i was able to allocate some for my loved ones for their personal life expenditure, the joy of giving an amount I earned was truly amazing. I don’t know how to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier I did give them, but that always used to be borrowed money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reinvested half of the profit and decided to gift my loved ones almost half of it and kept a tiny bit for me to buy just anything nice i want without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felt no regret selling. Felt great when the profit came to my account. Thank you everyone i guess. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a memorable moment of happiness in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
