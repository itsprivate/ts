Every 2016 blocks it automatically adjusts itself to keep a 10 minute block time.  The game theory and incentive behind it&#39;s creation means it draws the most creative and innovative persons and technology to it&#39;s development.  It&#39;s decentralization allows it to give the finger to any country that bans it, and it&#39;s use of the Internet, which is the lifeblood of every advanced nation on earth, means that to kill it you have to destroy yourself in the process.  It makes HODLers of every person who buys it because it shakes people out, who then regret every day the sale they completed when it was so damn cheap.  It makes you feel like an idiot because you didn&#39;t get in earlier, and keeps kicking you in the ass for selling when you did.  </p>\n\n<p>Satoshi Nakamoto shoud be awarded the Nobel Prize.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
