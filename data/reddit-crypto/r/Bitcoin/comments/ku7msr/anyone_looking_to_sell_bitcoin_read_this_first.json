Anyone that is considering selling their bitcoin to take some profits then think again. Big institutions are sitting there WAITING to steal it from you. This currency was made for us little guys, not them. If you sell your bitcoin then you don't deserve to be apart of this market. You are taking a gift and giving it to the people who want to control you. Whether Bitcoin goes to 1Mil a coin or zero, keeping control of this currency is all that matters. Bitcoin is not just about money, its a movement. It allows us to have a voice in an unfair system where we are controlled by the elite few. It allows us to say that we choose to NOT participate in your game. Bitcoin is power, and to give up the power you have to the powerful is sad. Remember the reason you originally bought, and no matter how high bitcoin goes, remember the reason we HODL. This will be a bumpy ride and I wish you all the best.",
