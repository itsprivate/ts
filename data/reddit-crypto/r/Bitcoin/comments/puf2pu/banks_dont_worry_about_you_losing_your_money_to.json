Are they protecting you? Or are the protecting their businesses? Are the trying to help you put food on your table or increase their own income? There are lots and lots of unanswered questions begging for answers. And I assure you, a skeleton is sure, in the closet here.\nBanks let you buy lottery tickets. They let you gamble with your money day in day out. With just a few clicks, you can play around with your money on all of these. And yes, you should be allowed unconditional access to your money, because it is your money - YOUR MONEY.\nBut when it comes to you buying Cryptocurrency, the bank&#39;s &quot;policy&quot; changes. I once got a message from my bank saying that, &quot;for the safety of my money, payment to Crypto platforms had been restricted&quot;. This was the funniest day of my life. I wondered why they didn&#39;t restrict payment to gambling and lottery sites? Oh yeah, I get it. They just never really cared about the &quot;safety&quot; of my money after all. They are only against Crypto because they know what it will do to their businesses. What they haven&#39;t realised is how unavoidable Crypto effects on banks and exchanges actually are.\nListen to Cryptocurrency critics talk and all they say are; Cryptocurrency breeds fraud, it helps to expand money laundering, it increases criminality, it helps bad people finance terrorism, blah blah blah blah.\nI beg your pardon, before Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin and subsequently introduced all of us to this beautiful world of awesomeness called Cryptocurrency, terrorism, fraud, money laundering, drugs and indeed all the bad things they accuse Cryptocurrency of had been in, not just existence, but on rampant occurrence.\nYou make your money, take it to the bank so they can help you keep it and release it back to you whenever you want to use it. Buy hell no, banks don&#39;t want to simply let you use your money whenever you need it. They want to be the ones to determine when and how you use your own money - YOUR OWN MONEY!!!\nUnfortunately, this will not soften anytime soon. Banks will continue to fight. They will continue to restrict payments and stop us from expanding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. And for this, you should not give up. Don&#39;t let anyone determine how, where and when you use your money.\nFam, I urge you to invest in Cryptocurrency. Don&#39;t pull all of your money into it. Why? Because I believe there are other needs and bills to take of. Rents, cars, insurance, name them.\nBut Cryptocurrency is sure, the future. And you are supper early in it. Only about 5% of the world&#39;s 7 billion people own Crypto and that tells you how much you will make when adoption explodes.\nBuy and HODL. Yes, HODL!!!\nYou will be fine, I can assure you.\nHave a great day wherever you are.\nLove you all!!!\nCheers...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
