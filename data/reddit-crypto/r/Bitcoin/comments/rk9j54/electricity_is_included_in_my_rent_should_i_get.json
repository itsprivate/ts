I live in a work/live loft where electricity is included. The landlord knows and is ok with this. I pay for it. People weld and saw things here. There is no electricity issue, nor is there an ethical issue involved. Just here trying to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: Is the Bitcoin community really like this? I like BTC less now. I&amp;#39;ve owned some for years, just not mined it. Looking to learn a little about mining and why not make a few bucks. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
