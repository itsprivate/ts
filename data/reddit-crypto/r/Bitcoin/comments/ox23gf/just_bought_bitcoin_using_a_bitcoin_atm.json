The only identifying information you had to enter was a phone number and birthday. It texted a confirmation code. So I guess if you had a burner phone and entered a fake birthday you could buy it non-KYC. The fees were really steep. I put in $285 and got $239 worth of Bitcoin.  The way the QR code scanner was angled made it impossible to scan so I had to enter my wallet address manually. Another downside is you don&#39;t get a transaction ID  so you can&#39;t track it on the memory. Bitcoin was in my wallet within 15 mins and of course went home and transferred to my hardware wallet. </p>\n\n<p>All in all it was a cool thing to buy Bitcoin with physical fiat but I won&#39;t be doing it again. Fees are way to high.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
