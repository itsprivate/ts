But for some reason my auto-fill wasn&#39;t working. I thought this wasn&#39;t right, but it was a fairly new laptop... So I manually typed in my login and 2fa. Then I got a text that I changed my 2fa. I didn&#39;t do that! So I tried to login to coinbase again. My 2fa code wasn&#39;t working. uhoh. I opened coinbase app on my phone and saw 2000 was purchased in Bitcoin. OMG! I disabled my account immediately.  My mobile app was signed out. Then I got the email for the 2000 purchase. I dont think the attacker had enough time to send my funds out. Then I looked at my browser history. I guess I went to coinbasi dot pro by typing coinbasr dot com instead of coinbase!  Then I emailed support @ coinbase my issue, what happened step by step, a screenshot of my browser history, my IP address, and a message that any activity not from my IP address was unauthorized. Mrrr. I plan on traveling internationally and was going to sell some coin to add to my bank balance, instead two grand was siphoned. I might have to change my departure date now. I&#39;m definitely calling my bank in the morning. I&#39;m nervous because anytime I email coinbase support it takes like a week to get an answer back. Ugh.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
