I really don't know why I did it but I thought it was a good investment because here in my country keeping your money in the bank is useless (like 1% annual interest rate) and is not convenient to keep large amounts of cash due to the high crime rates. So I put up all my savings, even convinced my mom and family to buy and they did it!!. And to my surprise in less than 1 month it went from 37K to 56K USD. This is mind boggling and a life changing experience for me and my family. Maybe I'm dreaming but if it goes up even more I'll be able to buy a house or start some business here.\n\nI really see now that BTC is the future, sadly not every one I talk about BTC understands or trusts it. \n\nThank you for this awesome community.",
