I did it over a span multiple weeks (following the dollar-cost averaging strategy). I haven&#39;t told people that they know me about this, and not planning to (for security reasons). Here is my thinking about why I did it and things that I considered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I&#39;m debt free and have no responsibilities (not married, no kids, etc.), so for me the time is right.</li>\n<li>I came across crypto first back in 2017, I was interested in the technical side more than the finical side. Bought a little back then, never sold it. Seen it dropped more than 50% in the short term and gained more than 200% in the long term. In the long term, it increases.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m in it for the long term (minimum: 10 years, maximum: forever).</li>\n<li>There will be never more than 21 million Bitcoin. That&#39;s scarcity, scarcity has value.</li>\n<li>Bitcoin adoption is increasing rapidly.</li>\n<li>Everything in life has a risk factor, for me holding a fiat currency in a bank that is losing value and purchasing power due to inflation is riskier than buying Bitcoin.</li>\n<li>I did my homework about crypto and security back in 2017 (private keys, cold storage, etc.), so jumping in is technically easy.</li>\n<li>I kept 1 year worth of expenses in fiat.</li>\n<li>I have a full time job so even if the price goes to zero I can start over.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m a skilled software engineer so even if I lose my job I can find another one or do freelancing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After all, maybe I will be wrong, and yes, maybe I will lose it all, but I&#39;m willing to take my chances. The important thing for me is that I feel good about my decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this is not a finial advice by any mean, I&#39;m just sharing my experience. Everyone&#39;s life and circumstances are different, and never put what you cannot afford to lose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
