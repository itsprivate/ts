I’m from Canada and I’m at the lowest point in my life - I’m overweight, lost my job because of the pandemic and I’m living with my strict ass annoying immigrant parents until I find something to get me back on my feet. I’ve invested my stimulus checks into crypto because what the fuck do I have to lose? Nothing. I don’t have a lot invested right now but I’ve made solid gains from the time it was valued at 36k USD. Feel free to call me a piece of shit after this, but I found a new passion and crypto is still in its early stages in terms of its potential. If you ever ask yourself ‘is it too late to invest?’ - the answer is hell no. Talk to the average joe, most are not invested. Bitcoin is STILL in its early stages. Investing only 1 dollar puts you ahead of most people. Hopefully I come back to this post a year from now in a better position.",
