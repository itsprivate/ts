  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high in October, a recent report from Kraken Intelligence sheds light on what’s behind the surge.</p>\n\n<p>Details: The data from the report points to a potential supply shock where long-term holders are not taking profits. The number of bitcoins that haven’t moved in the past 6 months has already reached a 3-year low, according to the report.</p>\n\n<p>Big Picture: Basically, the report finds a lot of strength among long-term holders and mining pools. This includes individual miners who have realized modest profits.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers: The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over 35% in October.</p>\n\n<p>Final Thoughts: Despite these trends, the report concludes that there is a considerably healthy macro environment for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this commentary.
