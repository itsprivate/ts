While dollars aren't \"vanishingly small\" yet, consider the following.  In 1930 the average price for lunch in a big city was [38 cents](https://restaurant-ingthroughhistory.com/restaurant-prices/).  Today a McDonald's meal in New York City can cost [over $10](https://www.menuwithprice.com/menu/mcdonalds/new-york/new-york/88485/).

That's almost $2T on top of the $3T the government would \"borrow\" (i.e. print) just to fund normal operations.\n\nA $1T market cap for BTC means the market is currently valuing all the BTC in the world at only about 20% of what the US government is going to print in 2021 alone.  This ignores all the past US money printing, all the future US money printing, leave alone the European and Asian money printing.\n\nTo me that isn't a number to worry about at all.
