I’m a big fan of Bitcoin because of scarcity. The other stuff I kind of abstract from. But when people say oh just read the white paper it’s funny to me because my co-workers who have degrees in CS can’t make much more of than I can. I’m not saying the white paper is wrong. It’s just funny to me when people yell on the internet READ THE WHITE PAPER. I bet most people don’t understand it. It’s a highly technical paper. Ok queue the hate and the nerds quoting parts of this. To be clear I love Bitcoin. This is a long winded way of saying the white paper is a technically difficult paper to get through and yelling read the white paper is a giant turn off to most. The end</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
