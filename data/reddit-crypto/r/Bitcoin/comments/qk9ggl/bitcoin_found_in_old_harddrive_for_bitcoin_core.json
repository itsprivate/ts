My fathers wallet was in my personal files because back then we only had 1 computer which was shared among our family. My father sadly passed away in 2017 and the wallet has fallen into my hands and it has alot of bitcoin in it (I won&#39;t disclose how much bitcoin, but it&#39;s REALLY valuable). I have let the wallet sync for about 2 1/2 weeks now and sadly its stuck at 88% and doesn&#39;t seem like it wants to move, any Idea on what I should do?  </p>\n\n<p>The wallet is MultiBit HD<br/>\nI have the information such as the seed and passcode.  </p>\n\n<p>I hope I can get some help from here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
