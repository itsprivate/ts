I have accumulated .81 BTC in just under 3 months for $28,000. Today that investment sits at $36,000. Regardless of the current price, letting my money sit in a bank account was no longer an option. And luckily my partner agreed. </p>\n\n<p>I learned about business’ investing in BTC after talking with a proprietor of a dispensary in Colorado. He was not given the option to bank under American federal law. Like so many in the third world who are unbanked, he found Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all the sound advice I’ve learned from <a href=\"/r/bitcoin\">r/bitcoin</a>. Such a great resource I’ve found in your posts and comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
