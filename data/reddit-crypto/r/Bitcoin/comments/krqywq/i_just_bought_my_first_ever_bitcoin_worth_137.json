The term for the same thing here in India is called SIP (Systematic Investment Plan).\n\nI literally bought at ATH 😅 but I'm in this for the long haul and I will HODL till my death when this ATH looks like a miniscule number and hoping to secure a good financial future for myself and my family. Wish me luck gentlemen!",
