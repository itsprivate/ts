There are over 1,800 bitcoin on the lightning network. over the last month over 350 were added - and I <em>don&#39;t know</em> if that growth is exponential, linear, or just a freak accident. <strong>Less than 0.01% of all btc in existence are on lightning now and if (hypothetically) you could go shopping for every day goods using lightning at supermarkets with lightning, there would be zero disruptions. Let that sink in.</strong> Use this as a visual: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/dfbjVCa\">https://imgur.com/dfbjVCa</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
