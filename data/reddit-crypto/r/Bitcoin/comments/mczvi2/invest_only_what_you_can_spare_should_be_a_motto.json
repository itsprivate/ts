Now that you discovered bitcoin you are thinking about doing it less to invest more. This is stupid. Always keep in mind that the future doesn’t exist, is an imagination, only the present moment is real. So go out and eat with your wife and kids and have fun now instead of waiting for something to happen that will give you the opportunity to have more fun. So even a 100€ dinner can often be a better decision than 100€ on bitcoin or whatever thing you invest.\n\nBottom line. Invest only what you can without compromising not even the good moments you can have right now instead. What you can spare is literally what would stay in pit of the bank month after month.",
