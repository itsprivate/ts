I'm fine with that. I like comfort too.\n\nDon't get this twisted-the people at the top aren't smart. They inherited an amazing, once in a 1,000 years system 80 years ago. And what did they do? They destroyed the system and gave the future generations the problems. They have kicked the can of debt down the road. \n\nI don't think you will ever see a mortgage at 4% again. EVER.  \nInflation? Minimum wage will be $15-and that's not even enough.   \nImagine paying $20 for a burger/fries/coke. It's coming.\n\nThe traders will tell you \"it's going to $25k\". I kick myself for not DOLLAR cost averaging over the last 4-5 years. Huge mistake.\n\nThe problems of society will not go away. At best they are delayed.
