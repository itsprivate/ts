Minimum wage will be $15-and that's not even enough.   \nImagine paying $20 for a burger/fries/coke. It's coming.\n\nThe traders will tell you \"it's going to $25k\". I kick myself for not DOLLAR cost averaging over the last 4-5 years. Huge mistake.\n\nThe problems of society will not go away. At best they are delayed.
