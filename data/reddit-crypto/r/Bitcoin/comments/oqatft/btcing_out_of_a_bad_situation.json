In many ways I had everything I needed, but lost a lot as time went on. I lost my dad. I lost a lot of friends, and now I feel like I&#39;m losing my mom to alcoholism. I work hard, and try to keep everything together but it never feels like enough, and the dread of impending, increasing living/housing costs.. not just for me, but my future children.. feels like a lead weight on my shoulders. I can&#39;t even watch the news anymore, listening to politicians tell me that inflation is &quot;good, actually&quot; just makes me feel sick. </p>\n\n<p>2 years ago I started to read about bitcoin. It sounded fresh and alternative and.. hopeful. I didn&#39;t invest until Aug 2020, buying 1 btc for around 10k. This was what I&#39;d saved for my future (not my essentials), and I basically thought &quot;if this turns out to be something small.. at least it&#39;s something in the sea of nothing, and that would be worth the risk&quot;. People told me I was stupid of course. But, I researched and I stayed strong. And here I am today, 3x up in a &#39;dip&#39;. </p>\n\n<p>Even in the worst most uncertain times, btc represents hope for me. When I&#39;m struggling with my day-to-day, I just remember that there&#39;s a light at the end of the tunnel and that everything I do doesn&#39;t have to just burn away to nothing. That I can protect my earnings and secure my future, myself. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m really grateful for this community, and appreciate everyone. Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
