However in my wisdom, I only saw a single use case at the time. I saw bitcoin as a currency, not something to be held and stored.</p>\n\n<p>I found these &#39;dark web&#39; stores where you could spend bitcoin and get stuff delivered!?! Amazing. I felt like I was in a thriller movie for a little bit of trees. During my time as a teen, I did this again, and again. I spent 29 bitcoin. At the time, this wasn&#39;t much, just my minimum wage job paying me enough to do something with it.</p>\n\n<p>Here I am, 6 years later. Struggling financially, investing in crypto and just wishing I had held it. $1.6 million USD, what a life changing amount.</p>\n\n<p>I dont know why I am posting this, but if I could say one thing to each and every one of you it would be to hold. Just hold, don&#39;t regret it years later like me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
