His biggest issue with wiring cash abroad is less the inconvenience on his end and more about what happens to his loved ones receiving the money.</p>\n\n<p>“They have to take a bus to go to a physical location to pick it up, and there are gangs that hang out around those offices. They know what people are going there for, and they basically rob them,” said García, who leads a team of researchers at SGI Canada Insurance. </p>\n\n<p>Since he last sent money home, García told CNBC, he now has the option to make an online payment via the Western Union app, but he still faces steep fees – 12.5% for a $100 transfer – and it doesn’t solve the problem of what happens to those picking up the cash in El Salvador.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
