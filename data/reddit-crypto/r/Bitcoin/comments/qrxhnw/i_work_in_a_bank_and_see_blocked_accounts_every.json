And let me tell you, most of those times they are blocked for no apparent reasons. I had plenty of those whose accounts have been blocked for weeks, they had no access to their money, and in the end, the &#39;suspicious transactions&#39; were transfers from family, or, even funnier, someone e withdraw THEIR OWN MONEY from bank A, transferred to bank B and then back to bank A. \nAnd my bank has the audacity to ask about the source of funds, depriving them of often their only money source. Because banks don&#39;t allow you to withdraw anything until they are done doing their review. And what happens when it turns out to be banks mistake? You can file a complaint and... That&#39;s about it. Go deal on your own with the investments you lost, food that you didn&#39;t have etc. \nHere is why Bitcoin is needed. So that some enormous corporation can&#39;t ask you &#39;Where did that $1000 come from?&#39;. Oh, and if you answer them the same day, good luck getting an answer in anything less than 2 weeks. They just don&#39;t care, as long as they can work your &#39;potentially unearned&#39; funds.</p>\n\n<p>Also, they block your accounts if you invest in BTC. because terrorism, right? No, because they want you to put your money into their &#39;fantastic deal&#39; 0.01% APR savings accounts, instead of staking for a MUCH higher percentage.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
