But I hate that all of that is just taken for granted, no questions needed. \n\nWhy in the name of sweet fuck is bitcoin the one thing people care about the consumption of? Nobody ever questions the intrinsic value of energy until needs start creating coins? Nobody ever breaks down the energy consumption of their daily life because they would reveal the fact they are wasteful.\n\n We've never heard anyone question how much energy the financial system uses until bitcoin started getting shit on. Ive never heard someone question the consumption of Twitter and whether or not that is a necessary service in this age of climate change. My theory is that the fact that a miner makes money makes people jealous so they paint them as selfish world killers.\n\nFurther wtf. There are oil and coal barrons spending their whole selves on keeping this dirty fuel in our society as long as they can. Why the fuck are we fighting with people about which technology should have to be banned when these pieces of shit are still poking holes in the ground. Let's ban them instead of the tools we want to use. \n\nI'm hoping going forward people see the benefit of fully democratized trust and truth and start evaluating energy consumption based on utility and not just megawatts.",
