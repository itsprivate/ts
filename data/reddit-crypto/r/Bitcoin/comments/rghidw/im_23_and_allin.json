It is just like Gold and Realty. Just upgraded to a modern and scientific type of way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a mistake. It most likely is but I am pretty sure we will see major adoption after several years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am here to HODL and basically never sell. Maybe I‘ll lend and buy back some but never sell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to get a better life later on and want to raise my babies until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current wallet is worth .45 BTC (45 Mil sats)\nAnd I hope it takes less than 3 years for me to accumulate 1 Whole BTC!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
