The population of earth stays at 7,700,000,000 or increases.

There are a maximum of 21,000,000 coins so let’s pretend they are all available.

You are in the top 1%!\n\nAnd in reality, we know that only 18.5m have been released. And 1m is in Satoshi’s wallets and they say 3m has been lost. If that’s the case then lower the 21,000,000 to 14.5 million and you would only need own 0.20 BTC to have more than 99% of the world.\n\nAgain, there is no getting around this. It is fact. It doesn’t matter if 1 person had the other 20,999,999.75 bitcoins. Your 0.25 BTC means you own more than 99% of the world. You would not necessarily be in the top 1% of bitcoin holders. You simply own more than 99% of the world. It is impossible for you to fall out of that number if you have a quarter bitcoin. \n\n0.25 and HODL.",
