People claim stock prices are built on \"fundamentals\" and they are to some extent. But every stock has INTRINSIC value (the \"fundamentals\", EPS, value for having a successful business, ect) and extrinsic value (hype, speculation on future, ect) This whole GME thing has made people realize that. They banded together and moved a market, sticking it to the guys at the top. However, trading was halted, and with malicious intent or not, Robinhood and its billionaire investors halted trading, ending the retail revolution. \n\nSo, now that people realize that stocks are bullshit with whatever value we collectively place on them, and that they have power in numbers... what is the logical conclusion?\n\nBITCOIN\n\nMore and more people will realize that decentralized finance is better in every way. It's sticking it to the government, not allowing them to manipulate and control every aspect of the financial system. If everyone just holds, everyone could be rich, and bitcoin could begin to rival the US dollar, with investors who got in relatively early being rich like all the hedge funds. Unlike in the stock market, no institution could halt trading, meaning there is literally no way bitcoin could be rejected. It's like the snowball effect. It will just keep getting bigger and bigger as it gains more institutional and retail support. \n\nFor part two of our theory, we realized that after our last president showed just how influential social media can be to politics, it is only a matter of time before someone runs for office on the platform of  Bitcoin and decentralized finance. Because decentralized finance would benefit everyone in the country, it could be a wildly popular opinion, and even a way forward into the future. All it takes is for this OBVIOUS idea of someone tying bitcoin to politics to happen. \n\nAnyways, am I crazy? Or did the universe actually give me reasons that bitcoin cannot fail?",
