We could raise taxes and “eat the rich” but that won’t even make a dent. The only feasible way to pay off the debt is to print more US Dollars until it’s value is near zero.  To make things worse, our government hasn’t even proposed a viable solution to fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Protect yourself from currency debasement and buy Bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
