And I asked them to put a PIN on my account   AND leave a note in there to only allow changes if I am personally,   Physically present at the store and have my ID with me.\n\nThey obliged and things were somewhat quite until last month.\n\nI   wake up one morning to an E-Mail saying someone is trying to reset the   password for my main E-Mail address. I look at my phone and I had   service and everything looks fine so I didn't think much of it.\n\nI   figured, Maybe it's the same asshole from last time because they keep   trying every now and then and every time I login I see a couple of new   IP addresses attempting to reset the account.\n\nA   couple of hours later, A T-Mobile Employee calls and says to let me   know that someone tried to access my account again, So naturally I   freaked out and explained to him what had happened before, So he puts me   on hold then a few minutes later, He back tracks in an attempt to calm   me down or whatever and lies to me saying not to worry, They did a   little more digging and it's not what they thought it was and that it   was an automated thing that they had put on my account since the   previous incident, and that they had to reset manually and they forgot.   And that nobody tried to access my account.\n\nIt   didn't make sense to me at all and I didn't know what to make of that,   But he kept reassuring me that everything is fine so I went along with   it.\n\nToday,  I get a letter in  the mail saying that on that same day the employee  called me, someone  gained access to my account, Ported my line to a  different carrier, And  accessed my CPNI data (Customer Propriety Network  Information),  Including calls made and received on my phone #. And that  he changed  the PIN on my account.\n\nSo  now,  The hackers have even more personal info about me and it's  floating out  there thanks to T-Mobile. And I am only hearing about it  from T-Mobile  because they are required by law to tell me :|\n\nAccording   to them, They already took care of it, But they \"Encourage me\" have to   call and update my PIN, Password, E-Mail security and financial and   other accounts. So clearly it's not as simple and harmless as they made   it sound on the phone :(\n\nI  am  pissed off and worried this was allowed to happen again. And I am   certain that if I didn't overhaul my personal online security and create   new E-Mails and cunt proof my account's I would have been taken to the   cleaners since the attack happened overnight and I didn't know or   notice until I woke up. I am now getting a new phone number with a   different carrier for sure.\n\nI am posting this here to warn people to not trust phone service providers **even when you have taken all the necessary steps to protect your account** because they are **incompetent** **AND** **negligent**. And will not have your back when shit hits the fan.\n\nDon't   wait until it happens to you, Be proactive and protect yourself.  Google  SIM-Swap attack and take all the necessary steps to prevent it  from  happening to you.\n\nThis is a copy of the letter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcttoh0mv0671.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4c7905e8d2aeb2690ddb8767bad4e437c184e4a",
