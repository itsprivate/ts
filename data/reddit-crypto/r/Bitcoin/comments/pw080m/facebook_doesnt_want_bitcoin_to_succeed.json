In fact I spend an absolute ton advertising there, have stock in FB, and meet with FB regularly. \nI do have a problem with the Suggested news feed Algo items that FB spits out at me on a consistent basis so I decided to count how many Bitcoin negative sentiment versus Bitcoin positive sentiment articles they feed me and how I personally feel each time one is suggested to me. Today I finally hit 100 and the results shouldn&#39;t be shocking at all.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of sources for these articles are Forbes, Business Insider and Coindesk. You should know that all 3 of them are pay to play.. meaning if you want to pay $$$ your article can be featured on them.</p>\n\n<p>Without further delay.. of the 100, only 3 had a positive sentiment for Bitcoin. I don&#39;t follow any Bitcoin pages, don&#39;t follow any groups and don&#39;t contribute to any crypto discussions on the platform so the suggestion is purely FB&#39;s way of saying yes we know you&#39;re into crypto so here&#39;s what we think you should read. The headlines have been &quot;Miamicoin set to grow faster than Bitcoin&quot; .. &quot;Find out why this viral TikToker has predicted Bitcoin&#39;s fall from #1&quot; .. &quot;Why Bitcoin is going to lose value due to X&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not fucking selling.. But why does Facebook want me to so badly? Why does Facebook want me to think that Bitcoin is going to lose to some random shit coin? Why does Facebook care that I read about Bitcoin with negative sentiment?  Why doesn&#39;t Facebook share relevant positive sentiment articles? </p>\n\n<p>Facebook knows whether you&#39;re pro or not. Facebook knows if you hodl. So here&#39;s my 2 cents.. If libracoin can&#39;t succeed than why should the Winklevoss twins have something more valuable than FB and FB will exert it&#39;s power over the people with it&#39;s own agenda through suggested news feed articles to negative sentiment articles that people will read and recite as if it&#39;s the gospel..</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
