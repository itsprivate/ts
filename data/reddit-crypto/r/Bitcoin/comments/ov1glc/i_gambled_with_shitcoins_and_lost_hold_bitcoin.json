During the bear run I hit the shitcoins and started seeing some big wins (rarely cashing out). This led to me swapping my bitcoin portfolio and through a series of bad trades watching it slowly bleed down..last night I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, I firmly believe had I held my shitcoins I would&#39;ve made it back however it was the constant chart checking and stress I couldn&#39;t handle anymore.</p>\n\n<p>It was gambling. Starting at green candles and freaking out at reds. Enough was enough last night when I was sat in the cinema unable to enjoy a film because if seen one of my coins not perform as well as it did the day prior. That was it for me. If I can&#39;t sit and enjoy a film (albeit it jungle cruise) then what&#39;s the point in chasing money.</p>\n\n<p>I bought back into bitcoin with a 70% loss. \nJust a warning for anyone else, I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir hear but there maybe someone in the same situation,. current glued to their phone screen chasing that x100</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
