I only explained to him at a 2 year growth, how he can invest $100 and return around $2000 in a time span of 2 - 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well he&amp;#39;s ready to invest $100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asked, &amp;quot;why does so many people not know about this that you are telling me&amp;quot; , I told him most people are afraid to learn about something they know nothing about. He then added that I was lucky to have realised all this about Bitcoin so early, and he&amp;#39;s proud of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandad is very open minded.
