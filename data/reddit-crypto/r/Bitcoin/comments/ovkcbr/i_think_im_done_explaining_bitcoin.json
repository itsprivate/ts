We made some gains together and analyzed/speculated on some new projects. I love the curiosity of new people coming into the space. But sometimes I get tired of explaining what the crypto verse is and how revolutionary Bitcoin is to closed minded people. I’m basically done explaining it to them. Once I sense some resistance, negativity, or a response claiming how horrible the space is, I’m just going to stop all together and walk away. To each their own right. It’s energy draining trying to convince to someone how fiat is a bad idea, how government keeps printing over and over again, and how Bitcoin and crypto fixes this. Just gonna focus on my portfolio from now on and anyone else that has the passion to learn. Anyone else feel this way or am I just going mad?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
