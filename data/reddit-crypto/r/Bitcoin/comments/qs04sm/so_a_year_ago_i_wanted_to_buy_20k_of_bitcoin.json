Would any of you guys that know exactly what your doing, (opposite of myself) buy right now at 65k per coin, or would you wait for a price correction, or lower price per coin? Really upset I didn&#39;t do this last year, but I still want to get into this market. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot guys. For any positive, and negative comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
