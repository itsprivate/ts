Me being the tech and finance savvy IT pro that I am, she thankfully believed everything I said without question. I already have alot of bitcoin as you can probably see from my earlier posts. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to make it literally dummy simple easy. So i made a coinbase account for her. She started with a humble investment of about $300 a year ago. That&#39;s it. (Honestly It&#39;s literally the same strategy I used 5 years ago just without altcoins).</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I asked her if she was going to reinvest and she was not sure. So i said &quot;well why don&#39;t we just set up autopay for just $30 a week, EVERY week no exceptions.&quot; That way she won&#39;t even notice the money is gone. </p>\n\n<p>So that entire time from about a year ago, she was investing literally just $30 a week. All the way from its highs of $65,000, all the way to the $30K lows a while back. The account balance has grown from that $300 to just under $4,000. </p>\n\n<p>She was SHOCKED, blown away. She was slaving away for 10+ years at her job at 50 years old just to accumulate a $50K 401K. Here I was under 30 years old and I have more than DOUBLE what she has saved in her 401K. I think it&#39;s safe to say that she &quot;gets it&quot; now. </p>\n\n<p>TL:DR - <strong><em>Guys, understand the time value of money.</em></strong> That little $100 starter investment goes A LONG WAY when you have alot of time to wait AND you consistently invest. Time and consistency. That&#39;s literally all you need to get wealthy with bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
