For now you need it to spend on most things still but holding it is a liability. It&#39;s designed to lose its worth, so you have to spend it or buy assets. It&#39;s good for the masses to keep it in circulation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway - the point that dawned on me was this: <strong>It isn&#39;t that assets appreciate, it&#39;s more that they just don&#39;t lose value like cash</strong>. Take a range of asset classes like property, gold, etc. It looks like their value increases, but on average what you&#39;re seeing is just what the money you purchased them with <em>would</em> be worth if it weren&#39;t designed to deflate.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not assets increasing in worth - it&#39;s the dollars they cost falling in value. They&#39;re really just a hedge against inflation. Some better and worse than others.</p>\n\n<p>Monetary policy erodes savings.</p>\n\n<p>The average person can&#39;t get an interest rate to beat inflation, and when they do they are taxed on it - even where the real value of their money is <em>less</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the wonderful things about <strong>bitcoin</strong> is that eventually everyone will be able to have <strong>savings that don&#39;t lose value.</strong> People won&#39;t have to hand money to a bank or investment fund where the financial industry take their cut.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine millions of people whose savings can be relied upon, where if you do nothing after 2, 5 or 10 years no government or financial institution has robbed them of their value.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s very exciting!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
