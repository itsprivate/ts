People have this preconceived notion that everyone who posts here have millions invested into Bitcoin and everytime they buy they're throwing down 10s of thousands of dollars, which just isn't true. Buying 25 dollars is perfectly fine..Hell, even buying 5 dollars is fine. It's getting your foot in the door and becoming part of the 1% of the population that owns Bitcoin.\n     For myself, I buy every two weeks on pay day. I don't care about the price because I'm not worried about the price tomorrow, next week or even next year, because I know in 10 to 15 years Bitcoin could easily be worth 500k to 1m. People are so caught up trying to \"buy the dip\" and get the best price possible, when its almost impossible. If you wanted to get in last night and thought it was to expensive, you woke up to a big surprise when checking the prices this morning. Telsa buying Bitcoin won't be the first or the last major company to get in on Bitcoin. It's the future. \n     If you're questioning \"where do I even buy bitcoin?!\". I  would recommend using Shakepay if you live in Canada like myself. It's one of the safest and most trust here. \n     If anyone has any questions or is hesitant on buying, please send me a DM and I'll try my best to help you!",
