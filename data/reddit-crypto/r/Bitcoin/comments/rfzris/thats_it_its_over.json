  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is what people thought when bitcoin crashed to 3K during the Covid-19 crash. What did I do? I doubled down. And guess what? I’m killing myself over not buying more because I thought “I’ll just wait and buy more if it goes lower”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember when hitting $30k was impossible to believe? Heck remember when $100 was just a dream? We are literally at 44-47k and people are acting like it’s all over. Investing is the transfer of wealth from inpatient to the patient. Sentiments change every day. Don’t be a fool. If you truly believe in the power of Bitcoin long term, these are the days you buy in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as easy money, or gaining wealth quick. Those who become millionaires over some shit coin that pumps \nFrom hype are just a few lucky individuals who got lucky gambling. Wealth build up takes time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are stressed over the current price action, you do not believe in what you invest, you have little to no understanding what you invested in, you are in too deep, or invested money you need for bills to make a quick flip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not telling you to buy the dip. I’m telling you that I’m definitely buying the dip. Only time will tell if it was the right decision. When it comes to Bitcoin I am willing to take that risk.  Don’t leverage trade, don’t panic sell, don’t doubt yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Markets are like a heart beat on the EKG if it’s not going up and down then it’s dead, if it ONLY goes up or ONLY GOES down it’s abnormal. Remember, Amazon stock dropped by 90% on multiple occasions. There wasn’t a single moment where selling it back then was a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to say Bitcoin will go up. I’m not psychic. The markets decide what the price will do. I’m saying I believe in this protocol to do well over a long period of time. Just like your high school grades don’t define your intelligence, prices don’t define the true value of an asset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish you all the best. Hope this helped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are all Satoshi!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
