It can’t be confiscated, stolen, devalued, undermined, frozen, etc. I can take it to any country on earth and easily convert it to some form of usable currency there.

My life is tranquil, every day I just do what I need to do to acquire more Bitcoin and I execute my plan effortlessly knowing I am on the path to becoming my own sovereign person that nobody will be able to control without use of physical force, which I will be prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
