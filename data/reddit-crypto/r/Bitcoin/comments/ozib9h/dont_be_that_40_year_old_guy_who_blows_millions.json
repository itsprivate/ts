This is about what I think to do and not to do.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 27, I met a guy at my apartment complex in 2011. He had made millions -yes, millions, in the mortgage market. He was making $800,000 a year-during 2007-that&#39;s like 1,200,000 today. And from what I understood, he was doing some shady ass stuff. He had the music video lifestyle-had a lambo, a house with an insane backyard, and god knows where he ate and what he did for fun. He had it all.</p>\n\n<p>The key word is HAD. He was in his early 40s. He said all he ended up with was a watch. He lost everything. </p>\n\n<p>The point I&#39;m trying to get across is this-twitter/instagram/etc is filled with traders making tons of $-the cars, the watches, clothes, boats, etc. 99% of this is for show. Most wealthy people don&#39;t do this stuff. Nothing wrong with nice stuff, I&#39;m saying what I know.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you love bitcoin or NOT, I hope you make tons of $. I hope you have a plan.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The way to get ahead is to make money like a rich person and live like a poor person for 3 years. The way to get rich is to do this for 5years. The way to get wealthy is to do this for 10 years. I know plenty of people who make $20k a month and are flat broke. </li>\n<li>Pick a vice. If you make more money, it&#39;s perfectly normal and healthy to reward yourself. Pick one-trips, partying, a cool car, dining out, etc. And know it&#39;s a reward. Where people get into trouble is car + clothes + partying.</li>\n<li>The more you make, the more you will get leeched on. This sounds shit, but it&#39;s true. I was a generous person and my generosity got taken advantage of. Do not be an unnecessary target.</li>\n<li>Create an income stream. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s $100 month. Create an income stream.</li>\n<li>Understand there are 100 people at party. 95 send checks. 5 collect them. You want to be in that 5.</li>\n<li>If you buy real estate, buy the shittiest house in the nicest neighborhood. Rich people want to live around other rich people. </li>\n<li>Don&#39;t tell your bosses/coworkers how much btc you have. Your boss will hate you if you are richer than she/he.</li>\n<li>Stay away from drugs and escorts. I&#39;ve seen people ruin their lives over this. Just say no.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t be an asshole. Bad karma.</li>\n<li>If you have tons of money, help the people who helped you on the way up. A gold rolex and baller penthouse won&#39;t make you happy. Giving your parents a vacation or car will.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
