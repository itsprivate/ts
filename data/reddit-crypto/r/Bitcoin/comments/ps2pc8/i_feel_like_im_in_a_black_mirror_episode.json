Different reasons, same fuckery. </p>\n\n<p>Do not stay blind to the ABSOLUTE OBVIOUS FUCKERY that corporations, and banks, and governments pull on people. FIAT IS INFLATED AND DYING, but so many ignore it. All the new printed money goes first to the central banks and all the players that manipulate the game, leaving crumbs to the ordinary people and fucking the poor over even more. FEAR, DISTRACTION, and CULTURAL CONDITIONING LEAD ALL OF THIS. RIGHT NOW there&#39;s highly idiotic cryptocurrency policies placed in the US infrastructure bill that is utter nonsense. </p>\n\n<p>Major news outlets are controlled by entities that don&#39;t want a monetary network like bitcoin, that is true with integrity and transparency and honesty, because it exposes the manipulation and tactics governments and billionaires and hedge funds and etc play. Covid isn&#39;t priority. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a war with monetary energy right now. Bitcoin was born to solve this, and it does. Read The Bitcoin Standard, read the original bitcoin white paper, look at the value of the dollar through history. We are in the birth of the metaverse. The rabbit hole is exposed.</p>\n\n<p>Watch how misinformed news article become, watch the countries that embrace the cryptoverse and those that stifle. Bitcoin has been tried, been banned, been manipulated, been talked down about, etc for the past 12 years, and its still leading the revolution. If you think it can be destroyed it would have been long ago. Bitcoin is being adopted faster than the internet; let that sink in. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the hardest asset ever created by mankind, nothing is more secure and integral, and can be moved and settled at the speed of light for little cost. No middleman to dip their hands in, no central authority to take away your sovereignty. This is what we are witnessing; these next 2-6 months will reveal truths to the blind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
