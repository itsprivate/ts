  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of Bitcoin continues to consolidate by moving sideways. The $46k-$52K area is where Bitcoin has been moving since the leverage flush of December 3 to 4, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear remains, and many investors forget that the price of Bitcoin is up +60% since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The price of Bitcoin never moves in a straight line. Volatility is part of the game, and the price of Bitcoin moves in successive upward waves interspersed with more or less pronounced corrections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently 30% below the ATH of November 10, 2021. There is nothing to be worried about, as this is nothing extraordinary in the world of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reasons to be worried totally vanish if you look at the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which are excellent. The on-chain data is bullish for what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current distortion between the price of Bitcoin and its fundamentals is due to the current uncertainty. Markets hate uncertainty, and Bitcoin is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is waiting for what the Fed will announce in a few hours. Once Jerome Powell puts this uncertainty to rest, the price of Bitcoin can resume its rise as I explain in detail in the latest issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: &lt;a href=\"https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-continues-to-consolidate\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-continues-to-consolidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
