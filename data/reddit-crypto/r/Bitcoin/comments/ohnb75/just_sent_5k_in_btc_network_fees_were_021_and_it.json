This wasn&#39;t even using Lightning or something like that. Which don&#39;t get me wrong, that&#39;s a great service, and I fully expect that or something like it to make BTC viable for retail shopping transactions.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously, what are the haters complaining about? Why would anyone possibly want to replace BTC with some new proof of stake system that&#39;s less secure? I just can&#39;t wrap my mind around that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
