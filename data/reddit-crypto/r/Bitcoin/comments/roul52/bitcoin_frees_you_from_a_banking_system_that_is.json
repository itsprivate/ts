  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current banking system is totally anachronistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You work hard to earn money. The fruit of your labor is placed in a bank account, and you want to be able to use it as you wish at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is normal since it is your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Saturday night and your brother in Australia needs $20K. Whatever the reason, he&amp;#39;s your brother, and you want to help him. You have more than enough money in your bank account to send him such an amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fruits of your labor should allow you to help your brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the current system, you will have to justify this money transfer to various services ranging from banking to government services, while waiting several days and paying prohibitive transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process, the powers that be in the current system may decide at any time to censor your transaction to your brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet it is your money, and your brother needed help immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with the current system is that there are far too many middlemen involved in the process. That&amp;#39;s where Bitcoin changes the game completely by freeing you from this totally anachronistic banking system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I show you how Bitcoin is a unique game-changer in this area, and why new generations will consider Bitcoin their de facto choice: &lt;a href=\"https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-frees-you-from-a-banking\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-frees-you-from-a-banking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
