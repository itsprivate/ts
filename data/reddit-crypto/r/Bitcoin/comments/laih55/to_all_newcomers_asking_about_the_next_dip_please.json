I am not a day trader, I don't give a flying fuck what the new  \"price floor\" is. As someone who has been watching the market for 7 years I can tell you this: Buy as much of it as you can whenever you can afford it. Wait 5 years, and thank me. Every single person with experience will tell you  the same thing. STOP TRYING TO TIME THE MARKET AND JUST BUY. I could  give you my opinion about the short term price action, but I could be  wrong and it doesn't really matter anyways. The money you may save is  not enough to justify sitting on the side lines. If it hits 220K this  year and falls back to 50k, then you will just tell yourself it's too late and \"I should have bought in at $33,000\". DO YOU GET IT YET? If you buy in at $33k and it falls, to $20k, who the fuck cares? Buy more. In 5 years your $33k buy will be worth a shit load. Not to mention you will be a part of the new monetary network.\n\nEven though I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I can tell you what I personally think will happen. 30k is our support level for now until price breaks bullish. It will have an incredible run up to  somewhere near 220k and fall to an unknown level. Could be 50k, could  be 100k. I doubt it will fall below 40k ever again after it makes this run because there are too many strong hands in Bitcoin now unlike 2017.  Historical data is useless when talking Bitcoin because it's an emerging technology unlike other comparative assets. There is no guarantee of anything. If you buy in at 200k IT IS STILL A SMART MOVE because I think Bitcoin's true value is in the millions.\n\nThis is not financial advise. Sometimes I put my finger in my butt and smell it, hard.",
