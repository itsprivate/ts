Not only it embraces third countries to preserve their wealth, but the finite supply makes value go up over time incentiving people to hold long term. In that regard, why would anyone sell something that will appreciate over time for things that will lose value like better cars, better phones or fancy clothes? I mean, if we don’t really need them, we will consume less and our planet will benefit from this. If Bitcoin goes up in value on the long term as scheduled by its mathematic algorythm, it could be a way to get out of this endless growth capitalism non-sense that is polluting earth and making people more selfish. Happy to see your thoughts on this :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
