I am new in this market, and made a post earlier about a &quot;friend&quot; of mine who ever since the elon tweets just full on turned into an insufferable smug asshole. The reason? I made the mistake of telling him i bought some bitcoin and other things.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>From that point on it was constant jabs, and forwarding of every single FUD article he can find into my group chat and passive-aggressively making comments towards me. Keep in mind: He did NOT care at all about crypto , up until I told him about it. And now he made it his personal mission to be a smug asshole as often as he can, about anything that paints crypto as a ponzi/scam/energy waste that will doom humanity.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Well, I KNOW it was my mistake for telling him. but it&#39;s been 3 months, and every 2-3 days its the same old shit. I nuked the group discord so that it&#39;s gone, disbanded the group chat and basically scattered the entire group and told him to shut the fuck up about crypto, and that I know he has something to say to me but he&#39;d rather pussy-foot around it and be a smug asshole and forward me forbes articles.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I hope those cheap chuckles were worth it, asshole. I was one of your last friends</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also, I KNOW IM DOWN 30%. I don&#39;t need some dickhead reminding me about it infront of my other friends every 2-3 days&#39;</p>\n\n<p>and even IF i may consider all crypto/stocks a pyramid scheme in some sense - he isn&#39;t coming from a place of concern. He&#39;s just being a smug asshole. He even told me &quot;I indirectly make people feel like shit&quot; and was proud of himself - because he cant just come out and say &quot;i think you are a retard for buying bitcoin&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
