Also they hipotesise on 2 possible outcoms in terms of adoption by institucions:\n\n* Corporations on the S&P500:\n   * **A**: Every corpoation there put a 1% allocation of their cash reserve in Bitcoin\n   * **B**: Every corporation there put a 10% allocation of their cash reserve in Bitcoin\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Institucional Investors (High Net Worth Individuals, Insurance Companies, Pension Funds etc..)\n   * **C**: Institucional Investors put a 1% allocation to BTC.\n   * **D**: Institucional Investors put a 2.55% allocation to BTC to minimize volatily.\n   * **E**: Institucional Investors put a 6.55% allocation to BTC to maximize the Sharpe Ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \\*\\*PRICE IMPACT WITH EACH SCENARIO (\\*\\*This was calculated upon a U$15,000 Bitcoin)\n   * **A:** U$ 40,000 increase.\n      * **A+C**: U$118,000 increase aprox.\n      * **A+D**: U$ 240,000 increase\n      * **A+E**: U$ 540,000 increase\n   * **B:** U$ 400,000 increase\n      * **B+C**: U$ 478,000 increase\n      * **B+D**: U$ 600,000 increase\n      * **B+E**: U$ 900,000 increase\n   * **C**: U$ 78,000 increase aprox.\n   * **D**: U$ 200,000 increase\n   * **E**: U$ 500,000 increase\n\nSo, to sum it up, ARK is expecting the price of bitcoin (with an adoption anywhere between 1% to 10% from corporations on the S&P500 over their cash reserves and from Institucional Investors between 1% to 6.55%) to be anywhere between U$ 55,000 to U$915,000. I do believe we are at the start of this adoption cycle and nowhere near the top, current prices are just a bit short to the lowest ARK scenario.",
