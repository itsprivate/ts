When bitcoin drops 5%, altcoins drop anywhere from 10-50%. Just buy bitcoin and hold it a long time. Use money you don&amp;#39;t need to buy it, and you will be pleasantly surprised a few years from today.&amp;quot;               &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I too also fell in to the &amp;quot;superior technology fallacy&amp;quot; that a lot of altcoins promised but either A) failed to deliver on or B) delivered with an unacceptable level of centralization. I went with altcoins over the years thinking, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just a matter of time until they surpass bitcoin.&amp;quot; But that never happened for various reasons.                  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing that bothers me now is the amount of new people we have saying dumb shit with regards to altcoins being &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot; to bitcoin without any well-formulated research on the topic at hand - and yes, that includes people like Elon Musk influencing people to buy new shitcoins or shitcoins that have higher inflation than what is considered a &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; amount of inflation in a growing economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
