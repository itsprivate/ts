However, when it comes to my USA members, there was no way to pay for a voucher in Grubhub. I tried paypal and my payments got “pending” for 4 hours. I tried my Visa/Amex cards and realized the website only allow US based addresses to make this voucher order.</p>\n\n<p>Disgruntled, I went to bitrefill, I know it will be fucking hard for me to expense this back to my company, but hey, I promised my team the vouchers so they will have their vouchers. A few clicks, no registration needed, and one minute later, I got two codes to send to my members in the USA.</p>\n\n<p>I love bitcoin ❤️ The future is here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
