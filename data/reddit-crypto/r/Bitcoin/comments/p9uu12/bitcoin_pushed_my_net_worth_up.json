I sold all my belongings, including my apartment, and went all-in in the only asset I was sure I could carry everywhere without anyone bothering me about it.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am living in a developped country but work a low-end job. I passed through the last bear market 70% down. I did not sell any bitcoin. I tightened my belt and bought a little bit more.</p>\n\n<p>Since this year&#39;s price increase I looked up how my Net Worth compares. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult\">wikipedia article</a> lead me to <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-databook-2021.pdf\">this report</a>. I found out that my Net Worth puts me at least in the top 25% of my country, top 10% for my age group.</p>\n\n<p>It makes me emotional: All my life I&#39;ve been punished for working hard and rewarded for keeping low profile. I&#39;ve been the family&#39;s scapegoat, a broke student, stuck in a souless corporate job, and a struggling immigrant. It&#39;s the first time in my life I have actual wealth that belongs to me and only me.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you Bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
