I basically lost $6.5k that I put in, which is pretty much all the savings I had and the profits that I made along with it. All because I didn&#39;t use stop losses and the positions just kept falling. I also should have never opened more than 10 positions. I had about 14.</p>\n\n<p>I was doing pretty well too upto this point. Since I am apart of some signals chats I had made decent money trading 20x lev, about $200-$400 per day in profit. I would also exit losing positions quick - but this flash crash caught me off guard. All my positions were losing positions and I didn&#39;t want to realize losses.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to share this here, maybe some of you could give me advice about anything at this point, don&#39;t know who to talk to about it. I know I can succeed with futures but I don&#39;t even know where I go from here since I&#39;m unemployed too. Its really taking a toll on my mental.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway thanks for reading. Any comment would be much appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
