I went to a school in the US and graduated with 360k in student loans for my doctorate. </p>\n\n<p>I averaged in to BTC, ETH, and LTC during 2017 and  started seeing some nice gains. Then I got heavy into altcoins, specifically raiblocks (now Nano). My small investment of about 10k went to 70k very quickly. This was an amazing feeling that only a crypto investor can understand. I was young and about 27. Greed combined with euphoria became a part of me. &quot;This can&#39;t drop and if it does it can&#39;t drop much, this is the future!&quot; I told myself repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p>Sure enough I held through the bear market. God damn was that hard. I lost about 95% of my 70k portfolio in a matter of months. Red day after red day. A constant bloodbath.</p>\n\n<p>I never stopped believing in crypto. Bought more in 2019 and kept adding slowly. Meanwhile I was also aggressively paying down my loan with 4.5k a month and living with my in-laws to save where I could. </p>\n\n<p>The recent parabolic rise to 65k was amazing. I began to feel the ultimate sign of a potential top, euphoria. I knew this feeling well and experienced it on that New Years Eve of 2017. Things are going great and I have a potentially life changing amount of money.   </p>\n\n<p>I told myself not this time around. I refuse to hold through another bear market, this euphoria is a sign. So I sold it all; about 2 Bitcoin for 120k. With my hard work and aggressive stance on loan payback I paid off my entire loan of 360k in five years and crypto was a huge part of that.</p>\n\n<p>This is a success story and hopefully it can reach someone that needs to hear this when your time comes. I am so sad to not have those bitcoins but when you can change your life make the difficult and mature decision, do it.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
