After just a few weeks I understood that all it did was make my mind foggy and take away my time.

I do believe it can be a major asset in the future and if not Bitcoin it self it’ll at least pave the way for the others. \n\nSo I’ve decided I will now take all the money I save from not smoking anymore and put it into Bitcoin mostly and other cryptos and stocks.
