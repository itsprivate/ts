Thanks for all the responses. Some general clarification - I’m not interested in teaching the technicals, yet. Many students have already asked me about Bitcoin and other coins. There are many ways to explain “what” Bitcoin is, and I see many more in the comments! I do not plan on talking anything market related. I just want to answer their question “what is this Bitcoin thing people are talking about?” And hopefully open the door to future lessons on what money is and the history of it. </p>\n\n<p>Also: I teach at a Charter. Long story short - I do what I want!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
