He spoke with alot of clarity and certainty, so that interaction stuck with me. The next few days I did my due diligence on researching Bitcoin and decided to toss around $1600 into it just to test the waters. I also called my dad, and somehow by the grace of of God, convinced him to invest into BTC. He bought 5k worth.\n\nFast forward to today and my dad and I both have more than doubled our investments. We've both since been investing more money into BTC and we follow it pretty closely. My dad is very happy with his BTC investment and I feel like a proud son for introducing him to it.

Your advice not only has helped double my networth, but you helped strengthen my relationship with my father.\n\n**Edit: It just occurred to me that the guy who was raving all about Bitcoin and told me to invest in it probably has made a ton of money from BTC since. He really believes in Bitcoin and spoke of it with conviction. He opened my eyes to a whole new world of currency. I'm sure he's sitting on an extremely generous profit. I'm happy for that guy.*",
