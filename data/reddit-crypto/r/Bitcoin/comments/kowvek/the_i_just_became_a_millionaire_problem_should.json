Now, you may tell your parents you've bought that restaurant or those apartments for renting out. You don't need to tell anyone your exact net worth. Talk to people about what you're DOING with your money, not about the contents of your savings account.\n\nOnce you've set yourself up with several or more income streams, you can buy that lambo.
