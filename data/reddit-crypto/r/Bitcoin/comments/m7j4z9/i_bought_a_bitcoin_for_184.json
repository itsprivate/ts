I bought my first 11 Bitcoins at $184! The date was jan 14th, 2015. Like many others, I sold them a year later at (what i considered, at the time) a considerable gain. Looking back, of course I wish I still had the coins. \n\nThe point being... no one knew! Lots of people sold around this time. You simply cannot beat yourself up for cashing out when it felt right. You can’t dwell on the past. \n\nIn late 2017, I started building my btc holdings back up. I have been buying consistently for the last 4 years and have yet to sell a single satoshi! \n\nThis time around is different! I’m glad to say, I feel good about my portfolio. However, it’s worth mentioning that we are in the early stages of this new world! \n\nI have many friends who reach out saying “I wish I had bought years ago, now it’s $60,000 a coin”. I try to explain.. when it’s $1,000,000 per coin, I would hate to hear you say.. “I wish I had bought when it was $60,000”.\n\nThis truly is early days. We are only now starting to see institutional adoption. Dollar cost average and don’t get left behind. \n\nLove this community and appreciate y’all!",
