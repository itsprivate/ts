While I was not involved for extended periods of time, it is something I have always been deeply passionate about. In 2014-2015, I was convinced bitcoin was going to be the future of currency. I had no interest in getting rich off of it and simply wanted to be a part of something that intrigued me. I have not posted on this subreddit since approx. 2015. At the time I believed bitcoin/blockchain tech was going to be as revolutionary as the internet. Through the years a few things have surprised me. </p>\n\n<p>- In my eyes, bitcoin would not have made it past 2015 without a hard fork, I still cannot comprehend that bitcoin is able to function (although not without flaws) in todays world with the volume we are seeing.</p>\n\n<p>- The publics perception of bitcoin as an inflationary hedge and genuine store of value</p>\n\n<p>- The continued praise of Satoshi and his vision, I believe bitcoin has mostly stayed true to its core values </p>\n\n<p>- I am astounded by the continued denial of cryptocurrencies as an asset class by institutions. Through reports I have read, institutions are only getting involved due to client demand, I firmly believe this is a failure on their end. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I cannot put into words how bitcoin has reshaped my vision of the world, and the revolution it has introduced to finance is nothing short of incredible. I&#39;d love to hear others experiences over the years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
