If Bitcoin integration occured, I wouldnt have to pay exchange rate fees for cash, ATM withdrawal fees, or 2.5% foreign exchange fee when using a CC.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Whether you like Apple, or not, I think Apple will play a big role in Bitcoin’s global adoption. Remember, there are ONE BILLION Apple phones worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: What I’d like to see is an Apple Pay integrated lightning wallet.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
