This specific no-coiner just will not buy BTC because they insist it&#39;s not &quot;real money.&quot; Maybe they shouldn&#39;t? It really seems the saying is true &quot;you buy bitcoin at the price you deserve&quot; basically lol. </p>\n\n<p>I know the US talks about &quot;regulating&quot; bitcoin, but do we really think they can ban it? </p>\n\n<p>When they have different opinions than you do about BTC, how do you deal with no-coiners and how do you deal with the people who say &quot;bitcoin is not real money?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is real money! Surely other bitcoiners understand lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
