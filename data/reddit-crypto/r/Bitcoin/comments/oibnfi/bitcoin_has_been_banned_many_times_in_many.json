Governments have started to reconsider their previous positions on their utility as some decide to adopt and regulate them as opposed to blindly opposing their use.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being banned in some major countries such as China, Bitcoin has still held strong, which speaks to its strength and adoption. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are some lessons as to why these bans keep failing</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot ban the blockchain, its code</li>\n<li>Crypto is more than just about money, it’s fostering other technological innovations</li>\n<li>It&#39;s solving real financial problems where other systems have failed</li>\n<li>The world is changing and so is crypto</li>\n<li>No real reasons/fears to warrant ban</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Banning crypto is ill-advised. Instead, governments should seek to consider a crypto economy as the early beginnings of a new open financial system. </p>\n\n<p>Article: <a href=\"https://zycrypto.com/why-crypto-bans-are-becoming-less-noticeable-on-market-movements/\">https://zycrypto.com/why-crypto-bans-are-becoming-less-noticeable-on-market-movements/</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: For anyone asking about the bitcoin vs Internet adoption rate - &quot;Bitcoin&#39;s mass adoption rate hints that the largest digital coin will hit the one billion user mark nearly two times faster than the internet did. As highlighted in the chart below, the internet took 7.5 years to go from 130 million to a billion users.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You can find the chart using this link: <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-bitcoin-grow-faster-than-the-internet-2021-05-07\">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-bitcoin-grow-faster-than-the-internet-2021-05-07</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
