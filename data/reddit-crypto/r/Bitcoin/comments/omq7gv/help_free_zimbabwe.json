I&#39;ve got a few questions I&#39;d like to ask about bitcoin and crypto exchange.\nI&#39;m from Zimbabwe (yes the country with trillion dollar notes). And it&#39;s no secrete we have a corrupt and dictatorship government here.our currency is worthless and as Zimbabweans we cannot shop online as our gvt won&#39;t have foreign currency to pay out of Zim. So here is my questions</p>\n\n<p>1). Is there a way our government can just Create a cryptocurrency exchange and just adopt bitcoin as main currency. That way at least we can buy stuff online using bitcoin and they still get their tax as they include it in transaction charges.</p>\n\n<p>2). Is there a way an exchange can be created and run in Zimbabwe but be registered with a foreign bank. That way our government will not have control. For instance, can a Mexican buy crypto and pay for it at an American bank.</p>\n\n<p>I know this my sound like stupid questions but I&#39;d really like to enlightend on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
