At that time, he didn&#39;t even know what Shiba or bitcoin mean. He had no crypto wallets, he was just making a random conversation about something he read online.</p>\n\n<p>I made the mistake of telling him that I invest in crypto and that Shiba is a shitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Everything ended up there.</p>\n\n<p>A week ago he read the news about the guy who invested 8k in Shiba and became rich and he automatically decided that now he would be a billionaire and he&#39;s not just because of me.</p>\n\n<p>I never told him to not invest in Shiba, I just expressed my opinion. He never really wanted to invest in any crypto. However, even if he invested in Shiba a month ago, now he wouldn&#39;t be rich at all. But he&#39;s too illiterate to understand it.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, he started to say that I made him lose millions and I should help him to recover (?!)</p>\n\n<p>I just told him I&#39;m not a trader and I don&#39;t give any financial advice. I really don&#39;t trade. I just buy the crypto I like and hold.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, he started to text me everyday about any possible crypto and asking me if he should buy it. I always answer that I don&#39;t know it.</p>\n\n<p>He thinks I&#39;m just selfish and I don&#39;t want to help him because I want to be the only one to become rich.</p>\n\n<p>He became very annoying so I blocked him in every social and I told him to not bother me anymore. So he just started to send me emails in my work account where I can&#39;t block him because he&#39;s a colleague.</p>\n\n<p>Few days ago he sent an email without any text, in the subject it was written &quot;shibazzilla: should I buy it?&quot;\nI didn&#39;t answer him.</p>\n\n<p>Now he told me he lost everything invested in shibazilla and he said it&#39;s my fault because I didn&#39;t warn him.</p>\n\n<p>I told him &quot;I just ignored you like I told you, I didn&#39;t tell you to buy it&quot; and he said &quot;so you had to talk when I was going to buy Shiba but you didn&#39;t think to tell me anything when I told you I was buying shibazilla&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He clearly got obsessed with crypto and he&#39;s too illiterate to understand anything.</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea how to handle him. He clearly got crazy. I literally told him to not bother me and that I blocked him because he&#39;s not my friend, but he doesn&#39;t care. He&#39;s doesn&#39;t understand it. He says I&#39;m kidding and we&#39;re all &quot;crypto brothers&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m afraid soon I&#39;ll end up beating him and then I&#39;ll lose my job.</p>\n\n<p>Any advices? Maybe someone had a similar situation?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
