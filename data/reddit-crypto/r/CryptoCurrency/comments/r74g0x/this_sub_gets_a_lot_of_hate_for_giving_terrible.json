You have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t time the market: Nobody knows when the top or bottom is in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do Your Own Research: Don&amp;#39;t take advice from random people from the internet. That guy who just posted that long and detailed DD could be 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majority of your Crypto-Currency Portfolio should be in BTC and ETH: Two of the &amp;quot;Safest&amp;quot; Crypro-Currencies to own with a great track record that are standing the Test of Time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose: For every person who leveraged their life savings into Dogecoin and became a millionaire, there&amp;#39;s a thousand people who lost it all - Don&amp;#39;t fall for Survivorship Bias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You Shouldn&amp;#39;t Invest Everything into Crypto-Currencies: A retirement account and / or a well diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, property and precious metals should be a necessity for everybody in Crypto-Currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Youtubers and Influencers Don&amp;#39;t Care About You: They make money off of your clicks and if they think that the bear market is around the corner, they will dump before telling you and not afterwards. A lot of them pump and dump coins as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody Knows Shit About Fuck: Probably the most important piece of advice on this list. The market is irrational and doesn&amp;#39;t make sense a lot of the time especially in the short-term. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s a case of Buy the Hype, Sell the News and sometimes it isn&amp;#39;t. Sometimes it shouldn&amp;#39;t go any lower or higher, but it just does against all the odds. Be careful out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
