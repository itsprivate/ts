After all, the only thing I knew about BTC was that it was some sort of digital money. But I kept holding and decided to start doing research and learning about the industry. It was around this time when I also found <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a>. Admittedly, this sub seems like a massive echo chamber for crypto bulls, but I&#39;d be lying if I said that the confirmation bias didn&#39;t help with hodling my BTC. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, after almost 6 months of being deep in the red with my initial investment, I&#39;m happy to say I finally broke even. I know the ROI isn&#39;t pretty at all, and having 0% gains in 6 months isn&#39;t something to be necessarily proud of, but I&#39;m glad I stuck to my initial purchase and came out of it being much more informed about the vast potential of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>Also shout out to this sub, a lot of good reads and memes alike. I usually just lurk on here, but I wanted to share my experience in crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
