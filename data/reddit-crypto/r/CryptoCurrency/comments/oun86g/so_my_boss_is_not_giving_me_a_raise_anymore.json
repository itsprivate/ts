I don&#39;t think I can still consider your salary raise request since your current salary is good enough for you to gamble it away.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>What the hell is wrong with some people, why is investing in crypto such a controversial topic? Where is this stigma coming from? I wish I could have told him the way Ethereum is changing the world at least, but he&#39;s not someone you argue with... This is the kind of shit I&#39;m trying to free myself from with my investments.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for venting, but I just have nobody in real-life that supports/understands crypto, not even in my family. Most people would tell me that he&#39;s right.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
