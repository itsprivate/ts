Why do people listen to these guys? Why do people look up to them? Most of them come from rich family&amp;#39;s or had some insane luck or connections. They are rarely different from your ordinary man and ever it&amp;#39;s even more rare for them to be a good person. They are like parasites latching onto anything with money. If Jack was so anti-centralization where was he 7 years ago or 5 years ago? These guys need to laughed at when they post stuff like this but instead they get praised by their flock of sheeps who don&amp;#39;t understand how to think their own thoughts. This stuff makes my blood boil.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
