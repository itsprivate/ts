Your gains are just paper gains until you actually realize them. Similarly your losses are paper losses until you decide to sell. Most of us learn it the hard way. Back in 2018 I had multiple x&#39;s of gains but I didn&#39;t sell and held them back to loss. I also had some coins in loss which I sold for loss and they went up few months from my selling date. So the rule is pretty simple and straightforward in crypto world. Don&#39;t just look at paper gains or losses. You haven&#39;t gained anything until you sell and you haven&#39;t lost anything until you sell. Hope this helps the new one&#39;s here. Cheers</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
