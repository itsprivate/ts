From December 2007 to November 10, 2011, the Federal Reserve, *secretly and without the awareness of Congress and the people*, funneled about $19.6 trillion to bail out the big banks on Wall Street and around the world. Just 14 global financial institutions received 83.9 percent or $16.41 trillion. These are the same institutions that were responsible for the financial crisis in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A list of the corrupt banks that received the secret bailouts and the amounts they received. \\(source: http:\\/\\/www.levyinstitute.org\\/pubs\\/wp\\_698.pdf\\)](https://preview.redd.it/i1hurh03uwu61.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25abd8ee3fd35aaed81273344ee71cdb23d2780)\n\nThis was only found out because Bernie Sanders amended the Dodd-Frank Reform law to audit the Fed, pushing the GAO (Government Accountability Office) to step in and take a look around. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and various other bankers vehemently opposed the audit and lied to Congress about the effects an audit would have on markets. This was the first audit of the Fed in the history of the United States since its beginnings in 1913. Unsurprisingly, this was scarcely reported by mainstream media – albeit the results are undoubtedly newsworthy. I find it funny that the American people were absolutely outraged that the federal government spent 700 billion dollars bailing out the “too big to fail” banks. Well, that bailout was pocket change compared to what the Federal Reserve did. Keep in mind that the GDP of the United States for the entire year of 2010 was only 14.58 trillion dollars. 19 trillion dollars is an almost inconceivable amount of money.\n\nTake all of the outrage and debate over the $1.5 trillion deficit into consideration, and swallow this Red pill: There was **absolutely no debate** about whether $16,000,000,000,000 would be given to failing banks and failing corporations around the world. The Federal Reserve and the big banks fought for more than two years to keep details of the largest bailout in U.S. history a secret. I find it pretty evil that they had such incomprehensible amounts of money to throw around to corrupt financial institutions while regular people were suffering and struggling to find jobs. This kind of gross corruption is what led Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin.\n\ntl;dr - Fuck the big banks. Fuck the Federal Reserve. Take back your financial power. Be your own bank.",
