Maybe you had 100k usd worth around Dec 1st or maybe you invested 100 usd. The important part is, if you just checked the charts and you still have enough to pay your rent, buy food, and live life as you were a week ago, you&amp;#39;re fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t over invest, you didn&amp;#39;t leverage, and you didn&amp;#39;t buy crypto with a payday loan. There have been much bigger flash crashes and if you&amp;#39;ve been here long enough, you&amp;#39;ll know that we could still drop lower at this point and still be fine if you&amp;#39;re following the above stated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prices will go back up, we&amp;#39;re still early in this. If this dip is negatively affecting your life, I hope you can get this sorted out to where you can safely invest your money next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime Holidays are upon us so call a family member or someone you care about and let them know they are important to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
