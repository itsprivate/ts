Makes holding easier.)</p>\n\n<p>The point is, if you believe in the future of crypto, especially blue chip crypto like BTC and ETH, then it isn’t too late, especially when the market is down like this. You don’t have to time the bottom perfectly. Nobody can. Just get in, start DCA, and hold for a few years. </p>\n\n<p>IT’S NOT TO LATE! This is a perfect time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
