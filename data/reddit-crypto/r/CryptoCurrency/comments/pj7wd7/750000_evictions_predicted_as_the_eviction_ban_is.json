We could even see another crypto winter. Real estate and land have become increasingly expensive and scarce the last 3 years or so. There will be a lot of folks who will drop their holdings in the markets to buy some real estate.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to look ahead as we ride this all rising crypto wave right now. It’s the moves you make in preparation that make all the difference. The game as they say is won and lost in preparation not by YOLOing.\nENJOY YOUR GAINS! but have one eye on your next moves at all times! Have a bronzer weekend Internet friends!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
