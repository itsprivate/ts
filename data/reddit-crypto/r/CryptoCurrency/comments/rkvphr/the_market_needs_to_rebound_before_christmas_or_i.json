Brother-in-law Charles will be pointing out how stocks have always been the only proper investment. Dad will just be shaking his head in disgust. It will be a collective circle jerk of “I told you so” all pointed at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I for one am hoping for a nice run over the next few days so I don’t have to listen to all the crypto &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; on Christmas day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Holidays to all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
