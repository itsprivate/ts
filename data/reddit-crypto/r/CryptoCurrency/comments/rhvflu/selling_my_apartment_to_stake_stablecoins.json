Right now it&amp;#39;s rented, and I&amp;#39;m getting around 500 USD per month. Those 500 USD are almost all exclusively used to pay the rest of the mortgage, which is ~30k. I get no profit with this apartment, and saying I sold it for 200k, I would get 170k in my bank account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I invest 170k on stablecoin staking at an average of 15% APY, I would get 2125 USD per month. This is a high salary where I come from and it would all be passive income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a bad idea? I don&amp;#39;t see the advantage of holding an apartment when I could be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
