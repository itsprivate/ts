That's nothing in the grand scheme of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDid you hear about those stories like \"someone bought a pizza for 10, 000BTC,\" that'd be worth millions now? Well, it took years for that story to become relevant. It doesn't appeal as much but **you have to start thinking in terms of years.**\n\nAsk yourself, if the cryptocurrency you are holding will still be here in the long term? If yes, continue accumulating. Otherwise, chill out because you've got confidence in what you are holding and continue doing research. And, if it's still a no-go, just sell it—you can support crypto without actually holding any.\n\nSo much about investing is more about being able to control your emotions and having the correct risk/reward management than actually picking a project.",
