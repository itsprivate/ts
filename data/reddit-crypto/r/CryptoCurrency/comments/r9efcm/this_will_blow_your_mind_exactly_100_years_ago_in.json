It was published the next day on December 4 in the &lt;a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1921-12-04/ed-1/seq-1\"&gt;New York Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. The title of the published article was called “Ford Would Replace Gold With Energy Currency and Stop Wars.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ford is well known for developing the assembly line technique and creating one of the first mass-produced American-built automobiles. Ford’s energy currency concept describes a digital currency much like Satoshi Nakamoto’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf\"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and one that is also scarce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only would Ford’s energy currency be backed by energy measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) he also &lt;a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1921-12-04/ed-1/seq-1/\"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; with the Tribune that the currency would “be issued only to a certain definite amount and for a specific purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has always been understood that Henry Ford was well ahead of his time, but he also thought about a concept that is very similar to what’s described in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf\"&gt;Bitcoin white paper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s very simple when you analyze it. The cause of all wars is gold. We shall demonstrate to the world two things, first, the practicability, second, the desirability of displacing gold as the basis of currency and substituting in its place the world&amp;#39;s imperishable natural wealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost everybody in the world except the newspapers and the bankers recognize that civilization has entered on a new era. The newspapers don&amp;#39;t see it and the international bankers don&amp;#39;t want to see it-it would mean changes in world finance and bankers always oppose changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is mind blowing vision from Henry Ford for the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;87 years later we got Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source : &lt;a href=\"https://richpicksdaily.com/how-henry-ford-envisaged-bitcoin-100-years-ago-a-unique-energy-currency-that-could-stop-wars/\"&gt;https://richpicksdaily.com/how-henry-ford-envisaged-bitcoin-100-years-ago-a-unique-energy-currency-that-could-stop-wars/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
