  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Exactly   a year now ADA HODLers have been staking and delegating their ADA to   stake pool operators = validators and getting their rewards every epoch   (= 5days)  and on average yearly delegation rewards of around 5%.   Meaning that if you started with 100k ada you&#39;ll end up with around 105k   after one year... Note that the rewards from one epoch are added to  the  next and the next rewards are calculated based on that, pretty  sweet!</p>\n\n<p>Cool  thing about staking  with ADA is that your ADA is never locked and you  can move it at any  time, which is not the case for ETH2 and  others...Also, pretty cool!</p>\n\n<p>About 70% of the total CIRCULATING supply is staked, see <a href=\"https://adapools.org/press\">https://adapools.org/press</a> and you can imagine what that means for the price once the smart contracts drop on mainnet on 9/12!</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the excel file with the treasury info. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://cardano.ideascale.com/\">https://cardano.ideascale.com/</a> to submit your own proposal!</p>\n\n<p>With addition from <a href=\"/u/Strictly_Haram\">u/Strictly_Haram</a> see below:</p>\n\n<p>Cardano  has a treasury built into the  protocol and currently is the largest  decentralized innovation fund in  the world. It’s called Catalyst, and  you use your ADA to vote on  proposals/fund development for different  dapp ecosystems, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This  will  eventually become full on chain governance (Voltaire) which will  allow  ADA holders to have full control of the chain. Whether it’s  changes  different parameters, funding development, etc. It really is  something  special and it’s unfortunate that it’s so misunderstood  because it is  has created a lot of hidden value for the entire crypto  ecosystem.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
