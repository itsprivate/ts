These guys are pushing usage of the DKG on a consistent basis as being not just a thing of the future, but a way for corporations to monetize their data right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seriously, a VP of Electronic Arts is evangelizing TRAC&#39;s network. Check his Twitter/LinkedIn.</strong> People don&#39;t take on these roles for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like such a no brainer after reading the link that was posted in another thread <a href=\"https://tracdeepdive.info/\">https://tracdeepdive.info/</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Is there some counter argument that I haven&#39;t heard?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
