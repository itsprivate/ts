It isn’t much but I owed him a tenner for something petty a few months back and gave him the choice between cash or  Bitcoin and he choose bitcoin. This morning I updated him on his crypto and he told me I’ve got to hold on to it till he’s 18 at least. This kid knows what’s up.\n\nI felt really great about my crypto story but tbh his will be better. Even though he’s young he’s got a foot in the game. I just wish someone has done this for me back then lol.",
