When you read the fine print, they give you .01% back. You can look this up yourself. Say I put $10,000 on a newborns account, in 30 years that $10,000 will earn that baby a grand total of $30, or, lunch at McDonald’s. </p>\n\n<p>In the last 5 days, my $200 investment on CRO has made me exactly $30 as of today. This is the same amount I would have made with a $10k investment with a chase savings account if I waited 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s say I put $10k down on CRO instead of the $200 5 days ago. I would have made $1500 in the last 5 days, and I could pull it out at any time. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously I don’t give a crap about a $30 gain in 5 days but I think it’s an extremely valuable insight to the following: fuck Chase bank.
