Techical analasis are so rare. I cannot remember when I found the new and interesting project here.\nAnd now LRC. It is everywhere, in every comment. Vitalik was speaking about it year ago that it was his favourite L2 solution (because of the decentralization). This GME thing is just riding the wave. There are numerous nft projects, but this is GME and the pump and shilling follows. How much is this really different from doge and shiba shills?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: for people asking why it has a comedy flair.
