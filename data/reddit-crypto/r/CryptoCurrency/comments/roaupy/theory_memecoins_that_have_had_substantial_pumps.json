  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be a controversial opinion and I&amp;#39;ll probably get several &amp;quot;remind me in X years&amp;quot; comments so people can come laugh at me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, but I really believe this. We all know that memecoins like DOGE have pumped and made many people rich. That&amp;#39;s why people invest in memecoins, because it&amp;#39;s a potential goldmine if you get in early with the right one. However, once a memecoin pumps, how will they attract new investors if they think the main pump has already happened? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has already happened with SHIB. Why did so many people invest in SHIB? Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was &amp;quot;the next DOGE&amp;quot;, a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could &amp;quot;do what DOGE did&amp;quot;. And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore? The kind of people who invest in memecoins are  trying to find &amp;quot;the next DOGE&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the next SHIB&amp;quot;, not DOGE or SHIB. So once new investors believe that the project has already had its big pump, they move on to the next one. Because anyone looking to invest in memecoins for the big money gains will invest into the newly rising memecoin that has yet to pump, not that ones that have already had their day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
