When I first got into crypto I got the about $30 worth of random coins like ox, dia, eos, bat and nu. I was too late for the good coins but still all of these went up over the years and I sold them all for ETH getting just over $250 worth. Now I have done a load of the more recent earns on Coinbase over the last few months as I save them for bear markets but was worried some would expire soon. Now I have roughly $3 each of The graph, Amp, uma, celo, band protocol, polygon, skale, and barnbridge? Yea never heard of the last. I’m quite sure these aren’t going to be crazy coins but I was lucky I got the GRT just as all was on the way up and celo a bit after so these are now at $10 and $6 but all the others were closer to the top so are roughly worth $1-$2. Now it’s still up in all and honestly these are just gunna sit in my CB wallet until they are actually worth something but I don’t have any doubts that it’ll all be worth well into it’s hundreds again within a few years. If btc does have another big drive up this year I’m quite sure these will already have a tasty jump too. Quite sure a lot of you don’t care about a few hundred dollars but I can also guarantee that there are plenty of people who can’t afford to put much money into crypto monthly and this would definitely help a lot. Lastly coinmarketcap also has an earn scheme but I haven’t used it yet, I only found out about it recently but will be joining and doing them to soon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
