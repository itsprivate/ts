Cryptocurrencies can be very emotionally draining, especially at this stage of the market when everything is down from their all-time highs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, even if you &amp;quot;only invest what you can afford to lose&amp;quot; it is still a bad sight to be down from your previous investment. A lot of people new to crypto sell at a loss because of this and regret it when the market ultimately recovers in the long run. Always DCA and bring down your average for the maximum benefits. History has shown that dips in Crypto are nothing but great opportunities&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: The best thing you can do currently is to not sell. The dip you see currently is nothing compared to what happened just this year alone. Selling now will only make you feel worse after the market recovers. You do NOT make a loss until you sell for a loss!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
