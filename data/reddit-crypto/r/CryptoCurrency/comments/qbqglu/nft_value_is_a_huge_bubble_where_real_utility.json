Unfortunately NFTs have been hijacked by dummies who think minting an image constitutes being worthy of a higher price than it was previously. </p>\n\n<p>This post has nothing to do with the price of NFTs. I don&#39;t care that somebody bought your nyancat NFT for 25$. That doesn&#39;t mean there was any utility or value added to the product, just somebody who is foolish enough to buy into this incredibly useless product because they believe someday it&#39;ll be worth more &quot;just cause&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin solves many problems with fiat and transferring value, your NFT is just a jpg that you threw on a block. You&#39;re not solving problems or creating utility for others, it&#39;s purely speculative useless garbage that threatens the crypto market because it will eventually collapse and people will lose money.</p>\n\n<p>Change my mind.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
