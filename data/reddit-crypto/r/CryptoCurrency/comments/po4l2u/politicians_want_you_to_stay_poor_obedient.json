This notion that anyone who takes a risk and then has success, is inherently taking food off the table of a poor immigrant family or what have you, is total BS. They need you broke, so that they have mindless drones working soul crushing jobs, so they can then take more tax dollars from you. </p>\n\n<p>Modern day governments are evil. They want your money, they want to control your life in every conceivable way. They think they know what’s best for you and society as a whole; they’re just incompetent morons who know nothing.

It makes you a sucker and victim of propaganda.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
