I live in Germany, and here you can sell your crypto tax free if you held it for at least a year. So to celebrate that my first bag of crypto is now tax free, I sold half the ADA I bought back then - receiving ten times as much as I paid for the full amount back then. I know it&#39;s probably not the best time to sell ADA, but I have more, wanted to take a bit of profit to celebrate my &quot;anniversary&quot; and I bought more over the following months, so it&#39;s not like I sold half my ADA. It feels really nice to finally take profits after what feels much longer than a year :) !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
