  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mainstream:&lt;/strong&gt; Only this year has Bitcoin gone so mainstream we cannot deny it anymore. It’s being advertised by celebrities, made fun of by South Park, and gaining more media spotlight every months. The people who love the tech bros now love crypto. It’s no longer niche. My mom asked me to help her.           &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation:&lt;/strong&gt; They are in the works, and ETF was just approved, others are continuously filing, there is movement and talk and deadlines, GG and the rest of them acknowledge cryptocurrencies as assets and promised to regulate them. With this movement comes progress even if it’s sideways.       &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions:&lt;/strong&gt; Buying and holding BTC has become easier for retail investors, the availability of institutional-level infrastructure has eased their entry and they haven’t even started to really pour into this space yet. It’s growing daily, enticing global investors to keep their capital invested in the hardest assets they can find. There is a wall of institutional money waiting for regulations to be put into place so they can dump their cash reserves into this new asset class.           &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflation:&lt;/strong&gt; inflation is real. Inflation is not transitory. Inflation is probably higher than how they calculate it. This is a global issue for all countries and monetary systems. Bitcoin is the answer the the problem of inflation. You must store your wealth, your value, your energy, your time, your savings, in something that outpaces and exceeds the debasement of fiat money.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sovereignty:&lt;/strong&gt; Cryptos now can challenge the primacy of the state and its monopoly on creating, printing and control of legal tender.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anarchism:&lt;/strong&gt; In a sense, “bitcoin is the spearhead of a particularly extreme form of libertarian anarchism” where cryptographically protected anonymization technologies, digital pseudonyms, and digital money are used to circumvent state control - surveillance, censorship, and taxation. Power to the people - stick it to the man.       &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;₿itcoin will trend upwards forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
