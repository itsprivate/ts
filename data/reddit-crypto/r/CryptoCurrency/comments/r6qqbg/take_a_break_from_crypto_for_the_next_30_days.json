Not even going to read/post anything on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this will be a healthy break for me.  I’ve been spending too many hours researching, buying high, selling low and maybe even a little shitposting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m going to take some time to focus on myself, get my workout routine back, more time with family and my kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that anyone will remember this post, but I’ll write a follow-up in 30 days.  Probably Jan 1st to say how it all went.\nI’m hoping to come back with a refreshed, balanced approach to crypto.  Maybe a little thinner too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone care to join me in this endeavor?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Taking a break from crypto to work on myself and spend more quality time with family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting…. now!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
