Market buying the shorted 6,800 BTC opened at that price \n\nif Bulls get control we will be looking at a $42,000 BTC. Then a slow climb to $50,000\n\nEdit: Up another 13% since I posted. They are really trying to push the price down \n\nEdit: Up another 30% since posting (90% now). Jesus they really want BTC to crash but its holding $36,000.00. Go Go BTC \n\nEdit: Bulls just jumped in 4% increase in long (Including me). Shorts up another 3.5%. To put this into context a total of ~7000BTC was just shorted worth $210 Million in 30 mins \n\nEdit: Up 105%; Jesus how much money do these fuckers have \n\nEdit: Up another 5% in 6mins, 110% increase! I'm all in BTC Kraken, Coinbase and 3X on Binance. Out of cash 100%+ all in hope someone is still buying\n\nEdit: Bulls up 0.9%, Shorts 5.9% (116%). BTC $36,600.00.00+ \n\nEdit: I can't believe it these fuckers just broke 120% increase in less than a hour. 15,000 BTC worth $450million. But BTC at $36,800+ GO GO BTC \n\nEdit: Longs showing weakness down 0.2%; people just got liquidated. Short sellers have unlimited funds it seems up another 5% (125%). Satoshi give me strength out of fiat  to buy   \n\nEdit: Now at 132%+ (1000BTC /$36 Million shorts opened in last ~30mins). BTC still above $36K. I went all in buying BTC, but put a stop loss at 1% loss of account on all trades. Now all I can do is wait and hope I don't lose money \n\nEdit: These fuckers are at 143%. They literally just shorted BTC nearly half a billion in about 2 hours\n\nEdit: Twitter to see all the Short liquidations occurring; enjoy the show https://twitter.com/whalecalls?s=09\n  \nPersonally have a short open on ICX with a stop loss at $1.07 and holding 25% of my portfolio in BTC. Either way its going to be a interesting and profitable US session. Edit Closed my short sending to BTC",
