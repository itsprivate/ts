When you vote perhaps comment a reason.\n\nPlease note, after you hit the 504 comments (including deleted ones) per month threshold you will still be able to comment, but the subsequent karma will not be counted for the moon distribution. 504 was chosen as it's 18 comments per day in the 28 day moon cycle.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kj2b8k)",
