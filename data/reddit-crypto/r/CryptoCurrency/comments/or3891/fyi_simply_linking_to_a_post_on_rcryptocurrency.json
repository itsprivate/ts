A lifetime ban will be given to the user who does the linking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I first interpreted this rule as meaning you cannot create your own post on <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> and then share that link in other communities and ask people to upvote it, which would make sense, because that is brigading. But this is not the case. Simple copying the link to <strong><em>someone else&#39;s post</em></strong> and pasting it into <strong><em>any</em></strong> other community (e.g. Facebook, Telegram, Discord, another subreddit, etc.) will result in a LIFETIME PERMANENT BAN from <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> if the moderators find out your Reddit username.</p>\n\n<p>These lifetime bans are given without warning and are permanent. I do not agree with this rule and everyone here should know the consequences of simply copying and pasting a link to a post they enjoy. Reddit has a &quot;Share&quot; button on every post which allows you to copy the link and share it, but if you actually share that link you can face a permanent lifetime ban from <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a>. This is not right.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
