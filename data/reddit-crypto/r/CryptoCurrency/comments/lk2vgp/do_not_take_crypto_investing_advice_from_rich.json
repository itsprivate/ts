Sure, it sounds amazing when someone invests hundreds of millions of dollars into crypto. **But they are gambling with a tiny relative amount**.\n\nWhen the average /r/CryptoCurrency user invests into crypto, they are likely putting a lot at risk in terms of net worth percentage.\n\nWhen the rich lose, they might not be able to buy their 50th car. When the poor loses, they go without food. The risk is not the same regardless of the raw amount of money lost.\n\n**In summary**: while no one actually knows what they are talking about in terms of crypto investing, you should put more value on the opinion of the person who risks 50% of their $10k net worth vs. the billionaire who puts 0.0001% of their net worth in.
