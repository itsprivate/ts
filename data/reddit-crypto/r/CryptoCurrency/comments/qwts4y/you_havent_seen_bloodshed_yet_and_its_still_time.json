You won&#39;t lose anything if you don&#39;t sell anything. But this decision has its cost. You may never know when the market will rebound. But one thing that is certain apart from death and taxes is that the market will always rebound no matter what. You have to be patient, and nobody knows for how long.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Sell before the market dips even more. This option is only for those who invested more than they could afford or considered crypto a get-rich-quick scheme. Patience is always the key here. If you can’t be patient enough, then crypto isn’t for you.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t become millionaire overnight, and any decision you will take during the current market movement will be another lesson for you. </p>\n\n<p><em>Fortune favours the bold.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
