I no longer need to validate my choices w emotional up and downs of market. I am happy with my coins and have accepted that some will go up and some will go down. \n\nOf course I realize its easy to not think about the coins when theyre all red, but I have been lowkey thankful for the dip to alow me to reset my priorities alittle bit.
