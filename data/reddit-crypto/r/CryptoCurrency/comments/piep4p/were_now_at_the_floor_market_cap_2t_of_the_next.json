Not even close to the Peak. 200-300k btc and 20k ETH coming, so hang onto your hats.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a super interesting and useful article that was posted yesterday. I’ve been here about 7 years now, definitely haven’t made any real gains during that time, but just bided my time and paid attention to long term patterns. I got scammed and lost 20k back in 2015. Basically my entire life savings. Had to start over and dig out of a massive hole. I didn’t give up. I persisted and came back from my lowest point ever in life. Now I’m here and 2021 is the time to get rich! For all of us, friends.</p>\n\n<p>I especially pay attention to Charlie Lee, who sold all his Litecoin at $350. He basically called the last market top to a T. He says we have a LONG way to go in this current bull run. </p>\n\n<p>Usually, we see 15x-16x gains from peak to market peak. We’ve only hit 3x so far in this market cycle. That means we could be looking at 300k Bitcoin in the not too distant future. And 21k ETH.</p>\n\n<p>If we all follow this, we are going to make some serious coin. No matter when you bought, no matter how much or how little you have, if you wait and sell during the euphoria (blow off top) when there’s a 2x price increase in a 24 hour span, you are destined for massive gains. Then, buy back in a few months later when the market is crashing 80% all the way back to 2T (current levels).</p>\n\n<p>The article is on cointelegraph and it’s called “How to prepare for the end of the bull run, Part 1: Timing” I’m posting the actual link in the comments below so it doesn’t get deleted. </p>\n\n<p>Curious to hear your thoughts, and this article has me feeling so damn bullish. Good luck friends, may the riches ever be in your favor.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
