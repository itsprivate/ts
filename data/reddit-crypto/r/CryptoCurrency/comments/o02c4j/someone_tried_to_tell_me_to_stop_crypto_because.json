As he was facing the cigarette.   He smoked two during our conversation.  But while he was shaking his head no he says.  *Nah , You can't be doing that for long, your talking a big risk the longer you keep it in* \n\nI asked him if he traded crypto before and he said \"no never\".    Then I asked if he's into stocks.  He said \"no never\".  But he heard stories. \n\nIdk bout you people reading this thread but...  I hear stories too.  All the time. I've heard stories about aliens also.  \n\nBut this whole time he's smoking a cigarette, and he's got scratch off tickets. \n\n He's a cool guy but I just felt like slapping the cigarette off his face, Grabbing him by the neck and screaming down his throat while I'm holding the cigarettes to his face...\n\n *YOU SEE THIS, THIS IS A RISK! THIS WILL KILL YOU, SO WHY DUMPING $300 A MONTH INTO IT*??\n\nBut I didn't.   The nerve of these people. Telling me to sell off my crypto.     It's better holding crypto to 0 than smoke risking cancer.\nBut I bet he wouldn't tell me to quit cigs If I was smoking.  $300 a month is $3600 a year.  These people smoke at least 10 more years.",
