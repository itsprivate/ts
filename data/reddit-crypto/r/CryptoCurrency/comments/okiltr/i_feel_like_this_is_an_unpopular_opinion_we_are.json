When we start seeing serious increases we can say we are on a bull run. </p>\n\n<p>There’s nothing wrong with going bull to bear and back to bull. It’s just the way it goes. A 2 month lull that’s down 50% is called a bear run, not just another part of a bull run. Can’t call everything a bull run lol.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like this is an unpopular opinion cause I see so many people saying we are still in a bull run and it’s going to last til next year or whatever. February to May was the bull run. May to current is a bear run. More bull runs on the way. But this is not it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
