You grab a newspaper to check the date and suddenly realize, newspapers are still a thing!  You aren't dreaming.  This is real.  You know what you need to do.  You need Bitcoin.  All the Bitcoin.   Where does one even get Bitcoin in 2010?  Or should you mine it?  It's going to take a little research.  So you open a browser to start figuring this out.\n\nGood god, Yahoo! homepage, by default.  Anyway, you figure things out and begin to sink every penny into it.  Bitcoin is at 3 cents!   You sell everything you've got.    You don't need your car, right?  Retirement accounts?  Screw it, it's worth the tax penalty.  Pokemon cards--actually maybe hang on to that one.  Once you're out of things to sell, it's time to start borrowing money from anyone and everyone you know.

He invented a currency that doesn't rely on a central authority.
