I just wanted to shoot out a reminder that the market doesn’t have to rule your life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can set your own schedule and your own budget and not have your investment practices be so chaotic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something to be said about the mental toll obsessing about the market takes on people and their long-term plans. Not to mention over extending their budget in FOMO which puts your entire portfolio at risk in case of financial emergency. I’ve seen far more people mentally burn out and lose interest (and in turn lose out on possible profits) than I have of people financially ruin themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
