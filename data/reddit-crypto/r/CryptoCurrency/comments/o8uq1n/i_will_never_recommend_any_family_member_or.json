I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can&#39;t afford to lose</p>\n\n<p>Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever).</p>\n\n<p>Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can&#39;t be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn&#39;t do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it&#39;s just a correction and don&#39;t sell but they aren&#39;t listening most of them sold and &quot;cut their loses&quot; before the &quot;bubble burst&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
