But, would you be able to hold them through such high volatility over the years?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to become rich, you need to believe in a project, put your money and then be patient for years. This means you need to hodle through the storm and ride out the waves. You need to be able to control your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are panicking right now because of this minor crash, you would have definitely panicked during all the minor flash crashes that happened in the past years too. You would not have been able to hold on to your BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe in BTC, ETH and other strong projects, dips and crashes are buying opportunities. Not the time to panic sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTC and ETH have stood the test of time. They are here to stay. Longterm holding will bring your fortunes. Panic selling will drill a hole in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DCA, Hodle and Chill. That&amp;#39;s how you beat the the algorithms, high frequency traders, sudden liquidations, and flash crashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
