Average two/three bedroom townhouse here is about 900k. We have finally saved up 15% of a down payment (other 5% covered) and we would love to get into the market before our family expands and before the inevitable interest rate hikes in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the holding is in ETH. We&amp;#39;re kind of going sideways with price right now but I would still cover the down payment if I pulled today at a recent low (4800cdn). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, if even 1% of an interest rate hike means an extra $100k on a mortgage, is holding for 6 months to a year to see a possible 10K eth a smart move? Am I basically gaining more crypto but paying more for a house as the rates go up? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m stuck between a rock and a hard place. A lot of hard work got me to the single goal that most crypto apes hold for, a house, but now I&amp;#39;m finding it impossible to pull the trigger. Also I don&amp;#39;t know shit about fuck and she&amp;#39;s probably smarter than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps: yes i&amp;#39;ll make sure to ignore any DMs with great offers on how to double my eth thx&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
