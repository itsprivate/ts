There is also a huge problem with reposting the same or similar articles. Right now, there is incentive to do this, as repeatedly posting article links with no other contribution to the post is an easy way to farm moons. Reducing the contribution point reward for doing so should help solve this issue along with cut down on reposts of the same or similar article.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reduce the contribution points gained from link posts by 35%</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/qh7ywl\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
