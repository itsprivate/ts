It is their own money, not yours. They can hold or buy whatever they want because guess why. IT IS THEIR OWN GODDAMN MONEY AND YOU HAVE NO SAY TO THAT! So stop bullying and making them feel bad about their crypto purchases. Some of them might be new to crypto and some of them bought the coins for fun. No matter the reason, this does not give you the right to ridicule people in this sub. Stop trying to bully people into regretting the coins they bought. You want to invest in coins like bitcoin and ethereum, go ahead but do not forget, just because you are buying a coin doesn&#39;t give you the right to bully other people who buy other coins.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
