Just use Bridge, easy asf...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having all the underlying fuctionalitys of ETH  combined with the low fees of matic is just awesome. Bullish beyond believe. I think if you are interessted in a crypto project actually using it is by far the best way to learn about it and decide if it is actually a good investment or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.
