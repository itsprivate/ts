Because, taxing something you don&amp;#39;t recognize as an asset of value seems very off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like the government does anything for the Crypto market either. The crypto market is an independent market unlike the stock market or a Fiat currency as stocks and other traditional markets are usually bailed out and kept stable by the government. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A government that provides nothing to Crypto, refuses to recognize crypto as payment and yet expects all Crypto users to pay a tax on the same asset is just hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: If a government refuses to fully recognize something as an asset, it should not turn around and make money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
