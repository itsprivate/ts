At the time a large chunk of the net profit and goals for each store was resale of used games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had like a 80% margin and made up about the same amount of net profit for each location &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With games being so much an download vs disk service now they have lost a ton of opportunity to make profit since there is no way to trade in a download. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was thinking about this today after being reading for weeks about a incoming GME and Loopring launching a Nft market together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve also read somewhere where NFT contracts can include royalties built in for any resale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sooooo.  Is GameStop about to launch a Nft collectibles market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or. Are they about to launch a games market with built in profit margins for all resales of those games using NFT smart contracts to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly that would be huge and an unbelievable larger deal in my eyes as compared to a collectibles market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a service like steam. But Nft based and having the ability to resell the game to a friend or even in trade in  towards other games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
