I will not be sorry if I upgrade, and hopefully, CRO will rise high enough for me to upgrade to icy white.</p>\n\n<p>I had previously encountered some issues with the card, but the customer support was extremely efficient and would respond to me within 15 minutes; I believe this is something that other platforms, such as Coinbase, do not have.</p>\n\n<p>Putting customer first is essential and I believe Crypto.com has nailed it. I believe other card holders have the same sentiment as I do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
