Keep in mind that since no data identifying you will be collected, I urge you to please be honest and only comment that you have participated if you really have participated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/\"&gt;r/&lt;/a&gt;cc family,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my master thesis in behavioural finance, I am conducting a &lt;strong&gt;study on cognitive biases in cryptocurrency investors, with the moderating role of Reddit in mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to test my hypothesis and research questions, I need data, and &lt;a href=\"https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2\"&gt;I have designed this short survey for that purpose.&lt;/a&gt; It will take you approximately 10 minutes to fill in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO personal identity data will be asked for, nor collected (no names, email address etc).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The topic of cognitive biases in retail cryptocurrency investors and the moderating role of social media in driving these biases remains a vastly under-researched topic (unfortunately). I believe this topic to be extremely relevant today, especially in such a high frequency market as cryptocurrencies. This is your chance to help participate in filling this crucial research gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://maastrichtuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSSloaBTcqhlc2\"&gt;You can find the survey here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to share it in your circles: the more respondents, the more data, and the more accurate the statistical results will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will of course be posting my concluded thesis once it is completed, so that anyone interested in the results can read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to participate in the survey, please carefully read the indications, questions, and please answer as accurately as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all very much in advance for helping advance scientific research in cryptocurrencies and investor behaviour!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me know in the comments if you have participated in the survey to enter the raffle for 100 moon reward (and please be honest)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Cheeseburger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: thank you so much everyone for the feedback, participation, kind words, awards and encouragement! It warms my heart! I am taking a small break from reddit to enjoy dinner, and will keep on replying to everyone later tonight. For anyone wondering - i will be posting the results along with my finished research paper around January, once I have completed my defence of my thesis! Thank you all again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
