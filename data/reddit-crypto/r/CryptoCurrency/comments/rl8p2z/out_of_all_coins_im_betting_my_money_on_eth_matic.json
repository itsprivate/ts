They are the best commit chain on the market right now in my opinion and have great projects on t he way. Even Mark Cuban joined his NFT website with them. They also acquired Hermez roll up which will increase their transaction speeds by up to 10 fold. Overall, great projects for now.And finally Cardano because the concept is still in its infancy honestly. It won&amp;#39;t be in full effect for years from now. I&amp;#39;ll hold their coins and just keep staking. By that time who know how high ADA prices will be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
