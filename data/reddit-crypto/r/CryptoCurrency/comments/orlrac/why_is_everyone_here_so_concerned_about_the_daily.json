I admit I check the charts pretty frequently but the results don’t really make me happy or sad cuz I know they don’t matter. I struggle to find a comment of someone saying they aren’t gonna hodl for a long time, which is good, yet I also can’t scroll through the sub without a bunch of people screaming in agony over their losses or excitedly claiming they’re about to go up 5 tax brackets. </p>\n\n<p>If you really plan on hodling for a long time then you should be aware that the gains and losses are basically fake until you get close to your withdrawal date. The losses won’t harm your wallet and the gains won’t fatten it up. So please,fix the cognitive dissonance and either admit that you don’t plan on hodling for a long time or stop caring about price movement that has a 0% chance of mattering in 3 years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
