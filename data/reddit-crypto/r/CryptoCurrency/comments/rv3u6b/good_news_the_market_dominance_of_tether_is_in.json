It&amp;#39;s not backed-up by cash or cash equivalent, it operates as a unregulated money printing machine and the company behind it &lt;a href=\"https://tokenist.com/tether-didnt-even-show-up-to-cryptos-biggest-regulatory-hearing-yet/\"&gt;hasn&amp;#39;t even answered to basic questions&lt;/a&gt; from the US Congress, which sounds shady as fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s a good news : &lt;strong&gt;Tether dominance in the stablecoins market is free-falling&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly a year ago, Tether amounted to about 75% of this market. This ratio has now fallen below 50%, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins\"&gt;currently sits around 48.69%&lt;/a&gt;. That means that more and more people are using more solid stables, such as USDC, Dai or UST, to buy or sell tokens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this important for the ecosystem? Because if Tether maintains a high dominance and crashes, as it will inevitably do, most trading pairs will become illiquid, and that would create a panic and a &amp;quot;bank run&amp;quot; from investors trying to cash out their USDT. This scenario wouldn&amp;#39;t be possible with more solid stables, because they have an actual working mechanism for those who want to redeem their deposits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s make 2022 the year we finally leave Tether behind!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
