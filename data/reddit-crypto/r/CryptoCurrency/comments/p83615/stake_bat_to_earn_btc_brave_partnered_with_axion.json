BAT can now be staked on Axion (AXN) to earn passive income in Bitcoin dividends. The shortest staking period generates a minimum of 8% APY.

It allows you to generate passive income with AXN, which will be burnt in exchange for shares from the dividend pool. The staking period could be anything from 1 day to 5555 days. A longer stake gives more bonus shares.</p>\n\n<p>The average stake length is 2547 days with more than 80% of the supply being staked!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>With the new integration not only AXN can be staked but BAT can be used to stake too!
