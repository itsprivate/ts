Wake up.  Stop kneeling to tyranny.</em><br/>\n———————————-  </p>\n\n<p>Every time I discuss my enthusiasm about privacy coin tech like Monero, or Beam, or Firo - this is almost always the response:  “<em>i don’t think it’s a good idea, the regulators will probably ban it.  its much better to buy taco dog shit coin.</em>”  </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of crypto is not to make you more US Dollars.  The purpose of crypto is to give individual human begins the power and freedom of money once more.  Yes, you can use it to earn more US Dollars, just as you can use it to buy heroin and pipe bombs online.  But that’s not why it was initially created.  </p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the Bitcoin genesis block is everything you need to know about Satoshi’s intent: a headline from the Times on that day about how the banks were getting yet <em>another</em> bailout.  The traditional fiat system of monetary policy was cracking, and Bitcoin was the first generation of something better.  </p>\n\n<p>At the time it wasn’t known how to incorporate good privacy (other than the existing pseudo anonymous address system) into Bitcoin, or Satoshi would have likely considered it.  He even mused about it in public BitcoinTalk threads.  </p>\n\n<p>But then in the mid 2010’s a miracle happened - new math was anonymously put forward that let us do exactly this.  The Cryptonote Protocol and Mimblewimble (yes yes, moon math too) have given us powerful new tools to establish decentralized money that’s also fundamentally private.  This (along with defi) is the next generation of cryptocurrency tech.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>It doesn’t matter what the oligarch dinosaurs think</strong>.  We’re not here to beg them for permission to have freedom.  <strong>Privacy is our fundamental human right</strong>.  And those corrupt fucks have shown again and again they can’t be trusted to take that right away.  </p>\n\n<p>So stop cowering to their tyranny, and stop thinking of crypto as an “<em>uwu pweeesze may i mistress yellen??</em> O.O” endeavor.  Crypto is here to disrupt and perhaps even destroy the corrupt perpetual war machine that is fiat, and even if <em>you</em> use it’s immense power for something else - the true face of this technology is far more majestic than most can comprehend.  </p>\n\n<p>Embrace it.  And embrace your fundamental right to privacy as a sovereign intelligence on this Earth.  Finally, for the first time in centuries we have the freedom of money once more.  Of course the oligarchs aren’t happy about that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
