I really think this will be the year crypto breaks out and becomes a staple for Finacial wealth and seen for what it is. It is the future. It has the technology and ultimately, it’s decentralized. These governments CANNOT control it. The word is out there and with companies like Crypto.com pushing heavily in the mainstream marketing, I think it’s going to explode. It is our time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What’s your plan? DCA, HODL or time the market? Personally, I have my eyes on a set few cryptos (the obvious BTC and ETH) and plan to continue to DCA as I’m long on crypto. But am I doing this wrong? What’s been the best plan you’ve set in place that has brought you success?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to listen!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
