He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the volatility. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.\nHaving said that, here’s what happened;</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track the crypto I bought and also so he keeps up with what I’m doing with his money. Naturally, I keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips.\nOne afternoon I kept getting calls from him on my workphone (he never calls me on my workphone). Flustered, I picked up the phone during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened. When I picked up he said the most boomer thing I ever heard him say ‘Hey, I have been tracking this coin usdt you bought, and it is not doing much, it’s not fluctuating at all, but I’m really, really expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!’</p>\n\n<p>I found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh about it. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I just wanted to share this giggle I had. Hope it also brings you some joy in these trying times.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
