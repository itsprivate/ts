Don't panic sell, and think carefully about where you set your stop-losses at least until the $100K mark. \n\nSo I keep seeing people compare this bullrun to 2013 or 2017. But they're wrong. Unlike the inherently speculative nature of the previous runs, this is an accumulative run driven by institutions and high-wealth individuals. They think and act differently, and you need to know the difference.\n\nYou may have noticed a pattern of late that an ATH is reached, and then it immediately pulls back significantly. I see people putting it down to \"corrections\" or \"dips\" that you normally see but it's not. It's an intentional market manipulation by those big players.\n\nThe problem that they're running into is that there simply isn't enough BTC on the market at any given time to satisfy the needs of the institutions themselves and the clients they serve. They have to find ways to pump liquidity into the market, so this is what they're doing. \n\nThey don't care about short-term trading losses. They're dumping large amounts of BTC in the form of BTC and derivatives to drive down the prices and trigger stop-losses and panic selling. BTC that would otherwise be safely locked up are being released onto the market, and they're snapping them up at (relatively) bargain basement prices.\n\nThen what happens afterward? They've now sucked all the possible liquidity out of the market. It's gone. Everyone they can possibly induce to sell has sold. Which leaves only those waiting for higher prices to sell. And so we hit a new ATH, rinse and repeat.\n\nSo how will we be able to tell when it's a real \"dip\" or \"correction.\" They've already told us. JPMorgan says their target is $146K. Citi says $300K. And if players like JPM and Citi have set targets, you can bet the others have too. We just don't know where they are. A safe bet is somewhere in between those two numbers.\n\nJPM probably won't wait for $146K to stop buying, and Citi's not going to wait for $300K. If I had to place a guess, I'd say somewhere that would leave them at least a 10% gain (which would be better than an average year investing in the S&P500). That places JPM's # somewhere around $130K and Citi at $270K. Until we're safely past $100K at the very least, they're not going to stop.
