I want out.\nLuckily it&amp;#39;s only 7 percent of my portfolio. \nI like the coin, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. But everytime it pumps a bit caused by an Elon tweet everybody starts to sell and that spike is wiped out in a matter of hours. \nThe sub reddit is nothing like it was 8 months ago, only bad and repetitive memes. \nI don&amp;#39;t see anymore trust in the coin from fellow holders and i think everybody is looking to break even and sell. \nIt&amp;#39;s never going to hit a dollar. And even if it&amp;#39;s breaking a dollar. Most of the people maybe get 2x. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah. If you not agree with me, tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  holy hell you guys are salty. \nWrong decision of me writing a critical post. It&amp;#39;s not me. It&amp;#39;s you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I got people in my DM attacking me.\nHow about D.O.G.E.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I can understand how some of you may be offended about me talking bad about ther &amp;quot;money&amp;quot;\nBut please keep it nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
