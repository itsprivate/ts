Even say, we enter the bear market again, it will only be a short span of accumulation phase where you get coins at an discounted rate before we get another bullrun and profit from it. Dip is best what can happen to you, it's an opportunity to accumulate more of your coin, if it only went up you wouldn't get such good deals.\n\nAnd my most important argument is that soon we'll enter the internet coin age, and now's the best time to get as many of them as you can. You'll be the early adopter and you'll do waaay better than people who get caught with hands in their pants with their useless FIAT.
