However I digress but that just let you realize how much powerful it is to just buy when everyone is scared and the world seems to be collapsing. and just hold for dear life. Also one of my favorite coins, VET is up nearly 100x since march bottom. Not that I bought then, I was not even interested in crypto is last March. But it just blows my mind the returns of crypto if you invested wisely for long term.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
