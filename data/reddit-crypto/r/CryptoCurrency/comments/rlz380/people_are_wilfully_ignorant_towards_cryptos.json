When I tried to comment that XTZ is actually quite low in energy needs, I just got ignorant replies and downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that sensationalist news posts about crypto are keeping people in the dark regarding the true potentials of crypto and blockchain. As with everything new they focus on a single bad aspect and enlarge it without proper analysis. It kind of made me sad to see so much ignorance in a sub that&amp;#39;s supposed to be dedicated to technology, out of all topics available on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
