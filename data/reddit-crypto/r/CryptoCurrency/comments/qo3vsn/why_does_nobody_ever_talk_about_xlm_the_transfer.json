It&#39;s use case is very unique in that it makes transaction fees negligible. I would think that a crypto like this would be pretty popular. If I needed to go, for example, from bitcoin to etherium, it would probably be cheaper if I went from BTC ---&gt; XLM and then XLM ----&gt; ETH instead of just directly BTC to ETH.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
