The will of the common person is gradually wearing them down, but some banks still make it incredibly difficult to deposit into exchanges to make crypto purchases.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve already seen adoption by huge institutions - and the recent applications regarding Bitcoin ETFs are very promising. Cryptocurrencies are the centre of attention for many news outlets; the daily number of crypto-related articles being produced seems to be increasing exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>The average person is far more clued-in than they would have wanted and only when negative press would damage their credibility do they give in (not all do but social media is a powerful tool these days).</p>\n\n<p>So, do spread the word; you don&#39;t need to give specific investing advice. Just tell people to look into cyrpto in general - the technology, growth and potential really speaks for itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
