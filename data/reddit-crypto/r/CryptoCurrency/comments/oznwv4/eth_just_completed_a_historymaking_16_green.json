This has also never happened before in it&#39;s 6 year history. I actually can&#39;t think of any $200B+ asset that has had such a relentless continuous rally before. I recommend opening up the ETH daily chart and looking at this sea of unstoppable green, it&#39;s a thing of beauty. During this incredible run ETH has gone from $1,706 and now is at $2,963 representing a +74% rally. Now let&#39;s take $3,000 and keep going!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
