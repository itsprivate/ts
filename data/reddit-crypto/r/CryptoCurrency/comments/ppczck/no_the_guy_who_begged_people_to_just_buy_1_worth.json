Not a single person who has been a part of the crypto-community for that long would know so little about it as this guy does.</p>\n\n<p>There is not a single bit of proof that this guy is a Bitcoin millionaire like he claims he is and to me he doesn&#39;t look like one either, he is a fraud and possibly sold his Bitcoins as soon as bitcoins price took off like anyone would had done in that time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>He is not giving away any Bitcoin and only wants to promote his channel, token and his Telegram group. Once again this whole sub is blindly following fake news/announcement without a single proof.</strong></p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Once again don&#39;t believe everything you see without proof, this guy is not giving away any bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
