Turns out my savings account at my local bank was paying me an annual rate of 0.05%, which is basically nothing, in fact due to inflation my money was most likely losing value.\n\nAbout two months ago I bought some ADA (Cardano), and read up a bit about staking. For those who dont know, staking is basically delegating your ADA to a stake pool, and you earn interest as a result. Your crypto never leaves your wallet, and you can stop staking and move your funds at any time if you want to so it is a safe process. I wont go too deep into details but by staking you can earn between 4-6% every year, and you are paid every epoch (5 days).\n\nIm happy to announce that Im currently earning more money every 5 days by staking that my regular bank account makes me in one year. Im not saying Im rich now btw, it is still a small amount but it is still mindblowing to me. \n\nHave a nice day people.",
