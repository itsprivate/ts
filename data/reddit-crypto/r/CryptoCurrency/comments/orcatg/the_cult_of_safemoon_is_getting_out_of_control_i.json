Recently between people whining about price, wanting more info, the corny cryptic pictures the Devs have been releasing, and the worship of “Papa” I have been getting a bad vibe.</p>\n\n<p>Cut to Yesterday…a character that goes by “Safemoon mark” released a new way to buy the tokens by using a contract address he created. It does seem to be legit, but people immediately accepted it and started buying through his created address. He was a normal redditer, albeit a super fan, and after the sub pumped him up so much, the Safemoon team actually hired him. I mean hey, good for him, but that is a little wild. </p>\n\n<p>So, I posted on their sub earlier just saying what if he was playing the long con…and that like 90% of the “Safemoon army” is so indoctrinated they just went with it with zero DD. Wow, I was attacked fiercely! How dare I even question that someone might try a scam in the crypto world. It’s gotten to the point that even mentioning anything that might be a negative about the holy grail that is Safemoon is undoubtedly FUD and I am obviously trying to take them down. Hmmmm…sounds very similar to things like Scientology. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I was about to buy a lot more, but after seeing recent activity and the reaction to my post, it’s like the veil was lifted and I’m no longer brainwashed. The Devs are all hipster 20 somethings with hardly no experience and they haven’t really delivered any of the “world-changing” concepts they speak of. I very well may be wrong and “Safemoon is the way” but I’m out. Any other people feel this way? </p>\n\n<p>P.S. The hatred for this sub is real over there. People even post screenshots of them posting here and saying their post was deleted as this sub is scared (from what I’ve seen the posts have been deleted for valid reasons like lack of character count, etc), but it’s a huge win for them! I’m sure I’d be crucified for speaking out on this sub. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the length, but just needed to get these feelings out. Like an epiphany.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
