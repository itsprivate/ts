But i suppose i cant be the only one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since i started with investing into crypto currencies, i find that more and more my thoughts turn around it. I check my portfolio like 25 times per day, and i am no day trader, i hodl what i have (besides some shitcoins for fun). So there is really no need to check the price every 5 minutes, because i wont sell anyways and a good portion of the funds are in earn programs or staked. So even if i wanted to i couldn&amp;#39;t t do anything if the market crashes. ok, sometimes i buy the dip if i get some dry powder left and the timing is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even spend too much time on reddit to read about it and the same for YouTube where i try to stay up to date with certain projects and follow some channels for info (coinbureau, etc.). Even while i try to get some sleep my thoughts turn around what could happen and what i would do ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes i think it would be really relaxing to just not open the apps to check where everything is at and just forget about everything for a month or two. But hell no! I am into crypto since the start of the year and never ever didn&amp;#39;t check everything for a even a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sometimes feel that it drives me mad. I certainly hope that i am not the only one in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your experiences, and how do you cope with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
