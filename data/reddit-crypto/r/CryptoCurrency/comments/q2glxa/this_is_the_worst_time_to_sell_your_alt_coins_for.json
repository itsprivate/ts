Bitcoin dominance has jumped too, currently sitting at 42.62%. If we look at the past trends, when bitcoin makes a move, usually alts dump on their BTC pairs while maintaining the USD value or sometimes dumping on that pair too. Once Bitcoin is done moving, it stabilizes at a certain range and lets alts run. The first alt coin which usually moves is ETH and all the others follow it. So if you&#39;re thinking about selling your alts for BTC in hopes of catching a further 5% pump, think again. ALT/BTC pairs are currently bottoming and have way much more room to run.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
