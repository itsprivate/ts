I was pretty clueless to begin with but I started delving into the posts and comments of this sub, I read the BTC white paper, and it wasn’t long before I bought some BTC. I remember how excited I was!</p>\n\n<p>I kept following this sub and over the next months I learned about blockchain technology, DeFi, NFTs…  I also bought ETH, ADA, AMP and more recently ALGO with just as much excitement as that first time I bought BTC! I learned to DCA, to buy the dips, to hodl and to ride the market waves. Heck, it was thanks to this sub that I even had my first FOMO moment a few weeks ago and bought some LRC!</p>\n\n<p>But what brings me the most joy one year on is that I’ve now bought a hardware wallet and some crypto for each of my newborn twins. It’s the BEST thing I can do for them with all that I’ve learned over the last few months. I’m sharing it with you all because the typical reaction I get when I tell people in my life is “Oh but you’ve opened a bank account for them too, right?”. </p>\n\n<p>I plan to buy them a bit more crypto every year on their birthdays, to educate them about it and give them their wallets when they’re 16 or so… I hope they’ll think it’s cool that their Mum did this for them!</p>\n\n<p>So I’d love to know who else is doing something similar? Have you bought crypto for your children, siblings, nephews, nieces, grandchildren? Or maybe for your cats and dogs? (Obvs not including hamsters because we all know they DYOR).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
