Investing in tons of altcoins in belief, that they will overcome Bitcoin and Ethereum. \n\n#**Most known types**\n\n1. **The Ethereum Killer Syndrom**. \nA syndrom, where one is in false belief, that his altcoin will take Ethereum’s place. Can’t understand that the projects can co-exist together. Often mixing apples with oranges. Mostly invested in Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, BSC, Solana. Still believe that TRON will dethrone ETH.\n\n2.  **The Altcoin Trainer**. \nTelling others that “gotta catch em all” is the way. He is true believer of the idea “if you own everything, you can’t lose”. He is HODLing mostly coins that no one heard of before. His role model is Ash Ketchem. Favourite TV series: Pokémon.\n\n3. **The Buy High Sell High High Low High High Guy**. \nStoned 25/8. He smokes so much that even the red charts are green for him. He can HODL for decades, because he forgot that he owns something. His favourite number is 4/20. Whatever Snoop Dogg says it’s prophecy. Favourite coins unknown because he doesn’t know it either where he is invested. Claims that he will never sell, truth is he forgot his seed. \n\n4. **The Family Banker**. \nConvinced whole family to invest in altcoin which isn’t even on any exchange. Promising 100x because he saw 2 Bitboys video’s. After big failure, he is hiding his head in sand. It’s his defensive mechanism. He likes to remortgage property of his family. He suggests to be humble and live in the cardboard box.\n\n5. **The Gambler**. \nHe came from stocks. For him, stocks are way too boring, he likes to live on an edge. Has a sleeping problems and all he’s caring about is crypto. Volatility is his dopamine. He’s looking for surgery, where he would get implanted chip into his eyes, with 5 seconds candles chart. He wants to stop blinking because it’s waste of time. Waiting for the devs of Bitconnect to announce comeback.",
