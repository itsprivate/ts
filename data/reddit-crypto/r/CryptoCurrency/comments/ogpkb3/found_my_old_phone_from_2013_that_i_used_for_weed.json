The good news is I just now realized I had 10 bitcoins on my LocalBitcoins account. No longer have access to the email I used then, but have reached out to the team to see if my account can be restored. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/piL3lfN\">The phone, and my weed transactions. ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚</a></p>\n\n<p>Might have had an account and Bitcoin on MTGox too</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
