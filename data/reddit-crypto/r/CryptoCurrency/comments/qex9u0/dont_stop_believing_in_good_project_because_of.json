It&#39;s price is hype driven, but hype will disappear eventually like it did in doge&#39;s case. So if you are considering to sell your bags of good coins to fomo into shiba don&#39;t. Even if it continues to pump it can maybe reach 2-3x more but that  would already be enormous marketcap. But when hype disappears people will start buying good project like the ones you own and you will earn much more than on shiba. This is simply how things go. We have to go through this phase of a bull market and wait for the next one where thing are going to be much better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
