I just got out of the shower and there were like 30 messages in a group chat. He’s going on about how it’s time to get in before crypto takes off. He said stuff about how defi is the future. He’s asking me to weigh in and of course I totally have this dude’s back. He doesn’t know much about blockchain technology, but he’s knows enough to recommend BTC, ETH, and ADA (I told the fam about ALGO and VET). He says, “now, I’m not very smart, so take this with a grain of salt…” I think he’s brilliant. His motivation? Not riches. Not lambos. Not a private island in the Caribbean (my particular motivation). Nah. He wants to pay off his kid’s student loans (we live in America) and to simply finance the educations for his grand children. I don’t know. That’s kinda cool. Just thought you guys would appreciate Grandpa Joe too.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: sorry I realize I was a tad confusing. He’s not my grandpa but my father-in-law. We all just call him grandpa Joe now that he has a couple grandkids. Cheers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
