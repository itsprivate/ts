As a whale, it makes no sense to accumulate right now if you're *not* going for one final push to the upside. It's better to just let market drop 90% then accumulate super cheap. But they are buying, and they are going for a final leg up.\n\n**Going Forward**\n\nIf you're really unsure about where it's all going, consider right now as an opportunity to get into the next cycle by DCA. Start with tiny amounts. If we continue a cycle to ATH, great, you've made money. If we don't, great, you're early for the next cycle, and you can continue to DCA during the bear, which will reduce your average cost.\n\nDon't listen to others.
