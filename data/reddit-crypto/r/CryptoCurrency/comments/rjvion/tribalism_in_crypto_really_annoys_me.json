Recently I came across a post complaining about how DOT isn’t in the top 10 anymore but ADA is and how life isn’t fair and OP isn’t making enough money. Boo hoo. These projects aren’t different football that we all support and have to be loyal to no matter what. If you really want to make it big in this space and the technology isn’t your priority then you really need to let it go. You trade it you don’t date it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also part of several different crypto sub reddits on here and the tribalism is ridiculous. I don’t know if it’s as bad as it used to be but the Solana sub was dominated by anti ADA posts. This is the real world, crypto is and will continue to be a shared space with a bunch of different competitors. We aren’t going to reach a time when there’s only one coin and the rest have given up, that’s ridiculous. We are going to see more and more competition and more and more coins doing well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to realise that devotion individual coins doesn’t matter and getting cryptocurrency into the mainstream as a friendly environment is the true goal. Thank you for reading my rambling, have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
