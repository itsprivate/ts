Especially with the DOGE coin trending on social media.\n\nPeople sometimes say, \"Aw man, if only I held on longer then I would've got more!\". \n\n**STOP IT. This thought can LOSE YOU MONEY.** \n\nI have seen people with not just crypto, always beat themselves down that they only made like 20% profit instead of 60%. If you do this, you could actually lose money on your next investment with this mindset. For example with the XRP Crypto. I've seen people go, \"Man, I pulled out early. But I'll rebuy it and maybe it'll continue to raise.\" and then all of a sudden drop back down to 0.39 and they lost everything they've earned.\n\nI bought DOGE at .037 and sold it at .054. Now it reached .078 recently. Do I regret it? **No.** Because it's soo damn easy for things to turn upside down. It dropped to 0.28 not long ago. Despite the unstable background and info on the DOGE coin,  054 was a good time to pull out, and the moment I did, It dropped down to .42! \n\nPeople sold their bitcoin years ago and made themselves hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. I've seen people save themselves from a terrifying medical bill or completely paid off their student debts thanks to their early investment. That is a success!  \n\nYou wish you could've stayed a bit longer when you're out and looking back on it. But it's a completely different thought process when you're actually involved and got your money riding on it.\n\nNobody has a crystal ball to predict that it can shoot up, and anybody who says, \"LOL pathetic paper hands you shouldn't have sold idiot\" are likely liars, foolish, gamblers with barely any understanding of how the investment/crypto world works. Ignore them. Never compare your success to others. Stories of people making +1000% in a short amount of time are soo damn rare. \n\nNo matter how big or small. If it's $20 Profit or $2000. If you're up and got out. You've won.",
