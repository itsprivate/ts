Unless you are a millionaire doing random things on coke, taking out a loan to buy crypto means you are already far beyond spending only what you can afford. It is very likely that you will lose money or at best, if you&amp;#39;re lucky, make peanuts. You&amp;#39;re probably not going to be the 0,0001% exception. You&amp;#39;ll lose your financial independence (which is ironic) and have a high chance to come out worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need to get it out of your system, dump $50 or something on a shitcoin and you&amp;#39;ll still get your experience of loss and regret, but not in a life-ruining fashion. Worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally you should reach a situation of positive indifference. For example, in the crab markets I pretty much stopped giving a damn. Still check my portfolio every now and then to see if there is movement. If there are big dips I watch it now and then to see if I want to invest more. If things are moving up I get a little bit more excited, but in a fun &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s see where this is going&amp;quot; way, not in a &amp;quot;so which house will I buy?&amp;quot; way. The key to this is the simple old saying: don&amp;#39;t invest more than you can afford. Of course if my whole portfolio suddenly went to $0 for whatever reason, I&amp;#39;d be pissed and probably wouldn&amp;#39;t want to afford a big vacation for 1-2 years, but that&amp;#39;d be it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
