This hurts the poor and middle class the most. </p>\n\n<p>But now we have crypto. Coins like Doge, ADA and others have all grown very fast in short periods of time. Potentially turning hundreds of dollars into millions of dollars. </p>\n\n<p>But how can crypto change this? Well first, <strong>you will not get rich by day trading crypto.</strong> Holding is the only way to become truly rich. Crypto gives us this chance. </p>\n\n<p>In less than a year, Doge went from $0.002808 to $0.70! If you had put $100 in doge that would have netted you $25k! </p>\n\n<p>ADA went as low as $0.08 this year. It’s now at $2.59! $100 in ADA would net you $3,250</p>\n\n<p>We are still early in crypto, and therefore, there are still a lot of money to be made. Crypto can help redistribute wealth but you need to not play with the system. </p>\n\n<p>The best strategy is to DCA, buy when prices are low, and hold until the money will change your life. It’s a long term investment, so treat it that way. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; you won’t become rich by day trading. Holding is the only real way to get life changing money from crypto.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A market cap today of 1 trillion for an alt coin may sound crazy high. But in 5 years it could sound crazy low.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
