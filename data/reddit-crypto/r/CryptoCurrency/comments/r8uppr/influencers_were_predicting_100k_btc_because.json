  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of posts yesterday complaining about wild predictions not coming to fruition. Multiple crypto-influencers were predicting Bitcoin would be above 100k before the end of the year, and as it&amp;#39;s not likely to happen after that nasty crash, some people are mad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the thing : &lt;strong&gt;talking heads are making crazy predictions because it&amp;#39;s what we, as a community, want to hear&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to be comforted about our investment choices, so we only listen to the voices that are churning out bullish news and insane price targets. On the other hand, down-to-earth influencers, or those warning us crypto markets movements are famously hard to predict, are ignored, while those with rocket emojis in their YouTube thumbnails are racking up millions of views for their videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the truth : when it comes to short-term prediction, &lt;strong&gt;absolutely nobody has any clue about anything&lt;/strong&gt;. We can try to predict where the market is heading (I tried it myself a few times), but to give a precise target such as &amp;quot;BTC 100k EOY!&amp;quot; is just non-sense. You could end up being right, or entirely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I try to stay away from all that noise. I choose solid projects, I DCA, I stake when possible and I relax. It&amp;#39;s really not that complicated. I still keep small bags of various alts, just in case, but the bulk of my money is into ETH. Of course, I won&amp;#39;t give you a price target today, but I am still certain that, in ten years, ETH will have more value then today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s my tip : get in with a strategy, and stick to it, while ignoring price predictions, TA and influencers. Long-term, you&amp;#39;ll be happier, and possibly richer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
