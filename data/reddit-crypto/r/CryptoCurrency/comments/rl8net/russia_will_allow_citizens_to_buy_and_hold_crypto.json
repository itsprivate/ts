So there won&amp;#39;t be any ban and this is actually bullish news towards acceptance of cryptocurrency buy governments and institutions.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Russia will soon publish a report in which it will describe it&amp;#39;s own vision of regulating digital assets in the country. This was announced by the deputy chairman of the Central Bank Vladimir Chistyukhin at a hearing in the State Duma.  “This report will contain our approaches related to the place we see for cryptocurrency in the Russian financial market. I give a hint - we do not see a place for cryptocurrency in the Russian financial market, &amp;quot;- said the deputy chairman of the Central Bank.  Chistyukhin explained that the Bank of Russia plans to legislatively approve the rules for the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Russian businesses and citizens have the right to buy and store digital assets, but not through the domestic financial infrastructure or intermediaries, Chistyukhin added.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13248893\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, stop please pulling baseless rumors out of your bearish asses, there won&amp;#39;t be a russian crypto ban.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
