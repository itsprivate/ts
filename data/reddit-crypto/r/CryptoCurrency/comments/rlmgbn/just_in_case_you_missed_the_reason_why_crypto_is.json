The individual amounts range from 300 to over 9000 euros. Everything is still particularly unclear at this stage but it seems that it is related to ongoing investigations in Germany on money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neobank has even proceeded to close accounts, which it justifies by the so-called non-compliance with the general terms of sale (when a customer opens an account in France while he does not reside there), or for any fraud and non-compliance with banking regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the customers have not recovered their funds, even though laws exist and provide for a restitution prior to the closure of the account of the funds. But laws are only interesting for those who respect them...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you see this, you really understand why decentralization is essential. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;link to the story in french : &lt;a href=\"https://rmc.bfmtv.com/emission/ils-m-ont-vole-9000-euros-des-centaines-de-clients-accusent-la-banque-en-ligne-n26-de-fermetures-abusives-de-comptes-2052769.html\"&gt;https://rmc.bfmtv.com/emission/ils-m-ont-vole-9000-euros-des-centaines-de-clients-accusent-la-banque-en-ligne-n26-de-fermetures-abusives-de-comptes-2052769.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
