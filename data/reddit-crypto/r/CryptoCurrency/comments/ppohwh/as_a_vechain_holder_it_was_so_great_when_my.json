See, the problem with VeChain is there&#39;s so many new developments it&#39;s hard to keep track of them all.  </p>\n\n<p>Oh, you helped track ocean waste?  Brilliant. </p>\n\n<p>Shrimps?  Why the hell not? </p>\n\n<p>Tracking parcels with major courier companies?  Cheeky.</p>\n\n<p>Authenticating vape products.  VeChain is doing it. </p>\n\n<p>Car manufacturers, transport and logistics, telecommunications, vape companies.  It doesn&#39;t matter what industry.  Vechain has got partnerships coming out of its arse.</p>\n\n<p>So then my phone beeped.  That&#39;s weird I thought.  I wonder what that could be.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s probably some news about Vechain.  Yeah it simply has to be about VET.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, it&#39;s Thursday.  It really has to be??!!</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Shibu Inu (SHIB) is now on Coinbase.  You can trade, send, receive, or store Shiba Inu (SHIB) today on Coinbase.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes crypto defies logic and reason and you just gotta love it for what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Although I am honestly surprised that Shib is listed before VET.</p>\n\n<p>I really think all those partnerships will mean so much in the long run.  When the market isn&#39;t so dictated by hype, utility will prevail and VeChain has that covered.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
