How high could it ever go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for your inputs and sorry if this is a stupid question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Didn’t expect so many replies on this but am glad to read all of them and also have learned a few things with this post thanks to all of you! All the 69’s and 420 something just warm my heart. Bless you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
