The only thing you would lose is a potential gain. Nothing more, nothing less. So, try to secure your initial capital and you&#39;ll be okay. You&#39;ll be much more calm and relaxed during these times. </p>\n\n<p>At least, this is what works for me. In the end, this is just my philosophy. Feel free to insult me or whatever.
