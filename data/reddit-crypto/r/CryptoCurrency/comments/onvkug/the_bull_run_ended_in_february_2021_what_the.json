There&#39;s an indicator traders like to use called the RSI or Relative Strength Index, which is used to track price momentum.</p>\n\n<p>The crucial bit of information is that the RSI for BTC was overbought in February and started to decline each month, despite the price continuing to rise. This is called bearish divergence, which occurs when prices goes up but our oscillator prints a lower high. </p>\n\n<p>Smart money knows about this, because that&#39;s what makes them smart. That&#39;s why when BTC went from $47K, to $57K and higher, they were taking profits on the way up. Smart money moved their profits into stable coin at the top. If they were really smart, they shorted down to $30K as well.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that&#39;s how whales play the game. That&#39;s how they can buy the dip. It&#39;s why they have capital to deploy at $28K and below. Crypto is not broken. We don&#39;t need to come up theories like S2F or lengthening cycles. The warning signs were there in February. Anyone who doesn&#39;t understand that and is complaining how we didn&#39;t go to $200,000 this year was simply asking to get rekt. </p>\n\n<p>You won&#39;t hear this on YouTube or Twitter. Looking at most of the shitposts on this sub, I expect this analysis will get buried. I&#39;m interested to see how well a genuinely informative post does. Let&#39;s see. Maybe this helps someone be smarter next time. </p>\n\n<p>Not FA, just TA.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
