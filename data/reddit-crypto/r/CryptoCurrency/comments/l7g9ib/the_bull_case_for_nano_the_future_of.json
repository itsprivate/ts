NANO uses a unique type of blockchain called a *block lattice,* where each account is its own blockchain. This is what allows it to be so efficient.\n\n**NANO vs. Fiat Currency and Stable Coins**\n\nA currency should not only be a medium of exchange, but a store of value as well. The US dollar lost 12% of its value in 2020. That is because 22% of all US dollars to ever exist were printed in 2020. Unlike the dollar, NANO has a capped supply of 133,248,297. It is impossible to create more. Another problem with fiat currency is that it has boundaries. If you want to pay someone in another country, you have to send them your native currency. They must take this currency and convert it to their own; which costs fees and wasted time. NANO has no boundaries. You can send it anywhere on the planet instantly without fees. \n\nWhile we are on the topic of fiat, many people like to argue that stable coins are a better alternative to nano; main reason being their lack of volatility. Stable coins defeat the entire purpose of cryptocurrency. They are the exact same thing as fiat. They suffer from inflation and government control because they are pegged to the same dollars that are printed every year. \n\nOutside of the United States, countries like Venezuela are in need of something like NANO to save them from economic collapse. They have gone through hyperinflation, which has devalued the Venezuelan bolívar by over 10,000% in just a few years. \n\n**Why Would Businesses Accept NANO?**\n\nBusinesses of all sizes benefit from accepting NANO. The average credit card fee generally ranges from 1% to 3%. That is about 2% of revenue that every single company is losing in transaction fees every year. In 2019, Amazon's revenue was 280 billion dollars. They lost around 5.6 billion to transaction fees alone. Had they used a feeless alternative like NANO, they would have paid $0 in fees. \n\n**Community**\n\nNANO has one of the most enthusiastic communities out there. They are constantly creating new ways to use NANO. For example, one of the community members created an app called WeNano. This app allows you to set up a spot anywhere in the world, and people can go to that location to collect NANO (Similar to pokemon go, but with NANO instead). \n\nNANO also has one of the most active communities. Nano is almost always a top 10 mention coin on Twitter. The community is so passionate that they will tell everyone they know about it. \n\n**Energy Use**\n\nAs the world moves towards being more environmentally friendly, NANO is the perfect currency. It uses millions of times less energy to run the network than bitcoin. That is not an exaggeration either. \n\nHere is an article that explains how efficient nano is. The network could be run on just one wind turbine. https://medium.com/@brunoerg/nano-is-green-d2f5cbf0e1d9",
