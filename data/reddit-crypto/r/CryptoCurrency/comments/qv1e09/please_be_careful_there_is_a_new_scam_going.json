He&#39;s been into cryptocurrency for a solid 3-4 years now and has made a fortune out of some good projects.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, he knows all the generic scams such as the &#39;copy-paste&#39; scam (where your computer has a virus and this virus changes your address to the scammers address when transferring funds), the gas-fee scam, and a multitude of others.</p>\n\n<p>Idk if it was a lapse of judgement, or just error on his part, but he said he accidently clicked on a Google ad for MetaMask wallet, which forwarded him onto a site with a near <em>exact</em> replica of the official website. </p>\n\n<p>It was phishing website that copied the brand and messaging of the original wallet website, to near <em>perfection</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, this was only one of many wallets that he had and the scammers ran away with 38ETH &amp; the remaining amount of shit coins left. </p>\n\n<p>In total, he lost perhaps ~$190,000 USD, including the shit coins. </p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, MetaMask took far too long to help him and to offer him support and the scammers successfully made way with the funds.</p>\n\n<p>Please stay vigilant. Don&#39;t get complacent. Part of the responsibility we have with cryptocurrency is to <strong>self-manage</strong>. If this is to replace the current banking system, we need to understand how important it is to uphold security of our wallets and our private keys.</p>\n\n<p>TL: DR;  </p>\n\n<p>Do not click on <strong>ANY</strong> Google ad search suggestions under <strong>ANY</strong> circumstance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
