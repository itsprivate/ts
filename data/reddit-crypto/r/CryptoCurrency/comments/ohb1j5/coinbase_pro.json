Today I used Coinbase pro to make 4 different 5$ purchases to test out fees. For each transaction it cost me exactly 2 cents and I could transfer it to Coinbase instantly for free. If I want to sell, I can then transfer coins from Coinbase back to Coinbase pro instantly for free and the fees are generally exactly the same. I can then transfer the cash to my Coinbase account instantly and cash out instantly to my bank account with fast pay to my debit card, it literally loaded the money back in about 30 seconds. They list a majority of all the coins on Coinbase pro and it’s super easy to use and understand once you mess around with it for a day. This is the cheapest fees by far I’ve ever seen across any exchanges including Binance. Coinbase pro doesn’t get the glory that is deserves!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
