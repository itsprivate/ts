Not only do they have a live chat feature, but they have actual customer support who get back and solved your problem the next day. I’ve seen some other crypto companies have live chat features like kucoin or nexo, but they actually speak English at kraken, and don’t make you wait for half an hour before giving you a shitty bot response. Also, kraken is super straightforward and reasonable, unlike some other crypto companies I dealt with in the past, such as celsius network when I had a 2FA problem ( had the same problem with my kraken account, but they didn’t make me do a damn head stand and grow an extra arm). So, if anyone is looking for an exchange that actually has customer support, and cares about its customers, I’d say go with kraken!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
