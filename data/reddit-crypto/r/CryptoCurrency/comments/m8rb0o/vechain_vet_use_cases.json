I think it's still incredibly undervalued at the price of 8 cents and 5.2b$ market cap. The most important info I want to share with you is that over 30 of the Fortune 500 companies including Walmart, BMW, LVMH, Renault and PwC have live solutions running on VeChain, with another 250+ clients currently being onboarded. I recently found [this article](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-vechain-vet) that fairly simple explains the use cases of VET, so I wanted to share them with you.\n\n### Food safety\n\nBlockchain-based solutions could lead to a more transparent food economy around the world.\n\nVeChain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be deployed across the supply chain, including on products, vehicles, and warehouses. Then, environmental and location-based data from these devices can be uploaded, verified, and stored in a tamper-proof, decentralized manner on the VeChainThor blockchain. Solutions like this are already in effect for several companies, including Shenzhen Yuhongtai Foods.\n\n### Anti-counterfeiting\n\nCounterfeiting in the luxury goods market is a serious problem. By attaching an encrypted chip and then using the chip to log and trace logistics, warehousing, maintenance, and resale, owners can be assured of authenticity. This has been used for luxury wine tracing for Shanghai Waigaoqiao Direct Imported Goods, and in testing for Renault luxury vehicle components.\n\n### Health records\n\nHealthcare records systems are notoriously archaic. Instead of using inefficient and insecure record systems for lab results, this valuable data can be stored on the blockchain, with only patients and other authorized parties having access. A VeChain-based E-HCert App will be rolled out to patients of both the Mediterranean Hospital of Cyprus and Aretaeio Hospital in 2021.\n\n### Tracking carbon emissions\n\nBy driving carbon reduction by tracking carbon-emitting activities, this solution allows consumers to be involved in a carbon-saving scheme. \n\nWhen smart devices, such as cars or appliances show that a consumer is generating less carbon, they can then receive credits to be used on energy services. BYD, a Chinese electric car brand, already uses a Vechain solution.",
