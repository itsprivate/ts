It feels like the corrections are the same but less growth before yet another correction/crash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see a need to sell my crypto anytime soon so I&amp;#39;m just looking at this as a way to buy more of the projects I&amp;#39;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what would you say officially signifies a bear market? How long does the trend need to be going downward to say hey this is the bear market people have been talking about?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking my strategy for an actual bear market is to hit Bitcoin and eth much harder and stuff keep holding and staking the alt coins I already have. Any thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: My question is poorly worded as I think it should have been more along the lines of &amp;quot;is this how a bear market starts?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve gotten some very good input though it&amp;#39;s much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
