I’ve lived through more crypto crashes then I have presidents at this point, and one thing I always have to remember is that setting a floor is a good thing. Sure we all want BTC at $60k + USD and ETH at $4k + USD but what people never talk about is how every time we gain a new all time high, we set a new all time high floor. If you would have told me 5 years ago my BTC would sit comfortably around $30k USD I would have slapped your mom for raising such an optimist. Just remember folks, the corrections are healthy. We haven’t shit the bed, just a minor shart. Throw them pants away and go buy yourself a new pair, next bull run will be nuts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
