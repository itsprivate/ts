If you&amp;#39;re not buying now you&amp;#39;re a fool!!&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;YES I dream of this stuff! Chips and dip!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, some people don&amp;#39;t have the fiat to throw in at a moment&amp;#39;s notice. Especially with the holiday season coming, things are tight for many. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some bought in a couple weeks ago which some now consider &amp;#39;high&amp;#39; (it&amp;#39;s not). Don&amp;#39;t feel the need to rub it in &amp;quot;Glad I didn&amp;#39;t buy &lt;em&gt;X date&lt;/em&gt; and got in after a crash&amp;quot;. Good for you, however new coiners can feel defeated by these things and nobody profits from discouraging people away from Crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have a small amount on hand, but I didn&amp;#39;t after the May crash and that was tough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Not everyone can afford to buy whenever the market dips, don&amp;#39;t gloat about it. Be supportive, if not just be nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
