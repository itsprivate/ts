Venus is a copypasta fork of Maker DAO and similar to DAI, Venus issues VAI which is a stablecoin pegged to the value of USD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcept its no longer stable, its value has crashed over the last few days and the $1 peg has now turned into a 9-10% loss for anyone holding VAI over other stablecoins such as DAI or USDC/USDT/BUST. And the value is fast crashing. $2bn worth assets in the protocol could be due for a liquidation if this mess isnt fixed immediately. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out, there is no price stability mechanism in Venus, the same mechanism used in Maker DAO which gives DAI its peg was not included in Venus' copy paste job. Incredible. For some crazy reason, Venus VAI stablecoin has no mechanism to adjust the interest rates and keep the value stable. Did the Venus devs really think the value would be stable all by itself? This is what happens when the Maker DAO team does all the study and research to build the product on Ethereum, but then a bunch of clueless developers without any clue of the economics of a stablecoin decide to clone it to profit from someone else's work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd to boot, if you bring this topic up in the Venus Protocol group, you get directed to a meme group and asking again you get banned because the mod says \"not the place to discuss price\". Yeap, you can't discuss the stablecoin's price on a group about the stablecoin project. \n\n[Sorry bois, cant discuss stablecoin's falling price in the group of a stablecoin project. Rules are rules. ](https://preview.redd.it/dlrn4we59hj61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0b6242b38b64fc7be1e7c1c73d0088076892212)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery project on Binance Smart Chain that runs a fork of an Ethereum project must be considered high risk because of the sheer incompetence of the developers running the show on BSC.",
