Maybe you&#39;re a part of the problem mate.</p>\n\n<p>Yes scams will happen always but when the hive mentality &quot;its only 20/50$&quot; still exists, crypto will never be taken seriously and adopted at large.</p>\n\n<p>Scams coins aren&#39;t gonna stop existing until the demand of them is non existant.
