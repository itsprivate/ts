Its more hated then Michael Vick in a dog shelter.<br/></li>\n<li>Tether - I’m guessing Tether is backed by some Dominos coupons, Monopoly money and maybe some Zimbabwean dollars.<br/></li>\n<li>SAFEM00N - I think the name actually fits the coin. Let’s safely bury it on the M00N so only aliens will ever find it. And when they do they’ll say WTF is this, then they’ll turn around and go home.<br/></li>\n<li>Ethereum Classic - There’s nothing classic about this “Ethereum” token. It was the adopted brother that nobody liked or wanted. Except those robinhood users.<br/></li>\n<li>Bitcoin Cash - Almost as good as cash. Which means it’s not good at all. Another loser of a coin that forked from one of the greats. If you’re not first, your last. This definitely applies with Bitcoin Cash.<br/></li>\n<li>Shiba Inu - The first dog coin of many. It’s the most hated because it’s not even the original dog coin!<br/></li>\n<li>Dogecoin - continues to fall down on this list. The ultimate meme coin is here to stay!<br/></li>\n<li>XRP - If Ripple was a real life person, it would be a tax invading dude from high school. So many questions the SEC wants answered.<br/></li>\n<li>Litecoin - Can we just be done already? Lite coin was created lite years ago and hasn’t done much since.<br/></li>\n<li>Titan - Almost as good as Mark Cubans first year with the Mavericks. I’ll leave it at that. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Honorable mention: </p>\n\n<p>Tron - Don’t know much about it but the movie was good. </p>\n\n<p>Hope you guys enjoyed it!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
