When the markets are good its fun, when the markets are down it's less fun but alike in both markets many of us are glued to our phones in an unhealthy way. I remember following the 2017 Bull Run I held everything through and didn't sell off. It was depressing seeing how much money I was down at the time. \n\nI recall at the time deciding to take a week off as I was heading down to Mexico with my gf, my parents and my nephew. I decided to not check prices and to tune out for a week. That week actually led to tuning out for about a year as why look at a market thats flat or trading sideways. \n\nOver the past year or two things have heated back up and I've gotten more engaged, sometimes to the point I'm checking my portfolio several times an hour. If you're actively trading I get it but if you're holding, your crypto isn't going to go anywhere it will be fine left unattended for a few hours and you not checking isn't going to tank the price. \n\nI'm guilty of this myself, especially with recently getting into Cub Finance I'm checking how much cub is in the den like twice an hour and probably cashing it out more often than makes sense from a financial standpoint since it does cost BNB to perform that action. \n\nI guess this is a mental health message more than anything else, spend some time with friends and family today undistracted by checking Delta or CoinMarketCap and even as we get into spring and summer be sure to get out and go for a bike ride, sit at the beach, go sit in a park or take a walk in the woods and get your face out of your phone for a few hours.",
