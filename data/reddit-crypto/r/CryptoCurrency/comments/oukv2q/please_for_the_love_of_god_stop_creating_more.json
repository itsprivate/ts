Ridiculously cheap, no whitepaper, some &quot;yield farming&quot;, 99% burned tokens, and a stolen UI interface like some doggy coins did to cover up that they&#39;re no more than a stupid scam. With insane promises of tripling your investment, of course.</p>\n\n<p>Just, why, why do y&#39;all keep doing this?! Stop. Please.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I know why this is happening. You want to make a quick buck, but seriously, there has to be another way. For the love of god, just don&#39;t waste precious energy, time, resources and your life on creating more useless tokens.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s stupid. At least connect it to some valuable product, like your physical store, your blog or give them out to your friends for shits and giggles but don&#39;t make &quot;babybitcoindogeshibamoon&quot; and give it a 99 billion coins where you burn 90% to hide how much you yourself really hold in comparison to others. It&#39;s just shitty behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Rant&#39;s over.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
