The best way to get coin sentiment is monitoring Reddit - which is what many of us do here daily anyway. We figured if there was a way to aggregate that data and see how coins are trending (in terms of percent increase in mentions), we could try and find breakout coin growth.</p>\n\n<p>So we scraped the data and started using it to trade. The results were great - we realized that even more useful than the actual mention count, was reading the actual comments mentioning the coin. People have great DD / analysis in comments so taking a look into specific mentions can guide your decision on a coin. It is also super real time information as we sorted by most recent mention.</p>\n\n<p>Then we decided to make this data public so everyone can have access in the form of a website - <a href=\"https://memebergterminal.com/crypto?utm_source=rcmark&amp;utm_medium=cryptocurrency\">https://memebergterminal.com/crypto</a> (example coin page: <a href=\"https://www.memebergterminal.com/crypto/stock/Loopring/LRC?utm_source=rcmark&amp;utm_medium=cryptocurrency\">https://www.memebergterminal.com/crypto/stock/Loopring/LRC</a>)</p>\n\n<p>You can do two things with the site -</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>See trending coin mentions split by each subreddit. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/\">r/cryptocurrency</a> is still the biggest and most useful. You can sort by percent mentions instead of new</li>\n<li>Ctrl + F for a coin to see the specific mentions about a coin. If you are on the edge of buying a coin, being able to easily search for the ticker and see what people are saying about it in real time can help you make a decision.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
