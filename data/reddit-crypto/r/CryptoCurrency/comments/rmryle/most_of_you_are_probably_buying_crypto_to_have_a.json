  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just saw another one of those threads that get posted on here regularly, something like &amp;quot;what can you cut back on to buy even more crypto??&amp;quot; As always, there are a few suggestions that makes sense (&amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t play the lottery&amp;quot; - I mean, sure, crypto is the better gamble), but, predictably, most are stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#39;t eat out&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#39;t buy clothes you enjoy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;stuff like Netflix? don&amp;#39;t need that, doesn&amp;#39;t make you a profit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;etc etc - and come on guys, really? The general sentiment in these threads always is &amp;quot;sacrifices now will be worth it&amp;quot;. And I think that&amp;#39;s a really bad attitude, for at least two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, maybe it won&amp;#39;t work out. There are no guarantees, maybe we&amp;#39;re all way too late and 2 months ago was the all time peak for crypto and it&amp;#39;s all downhill from here. Do I think so? Nah. Is it possible? 100%! So even if you make huge sacrifices now, you might end up broke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to now live badly now to be well off at some point in the future. Maybe you&amp;#39;ll die in a car crash in 5 years, maybe your health goes downhill and you can&amp;#39;t enjoy life as you could do now. Maybe you will be super rich and can quit your job - and then you&amp;#39;ll be bored because you gave up on all of your hobbies and don&amp;#39;t know what to do with your time, except try to earn even more money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying you shouldn&amp;#39;t invest in crypto, I&amp;#39;m not saying you should spend huge amounts of money on useless garbage either. I&amp;#39;m just saying that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use all your free time and all your disposable money (not even all that you could theoretically afford to lose) on crypto in the hope to one day live nicely, if you have to live miserably and cannot spend money on fun stuff now. Find a balance that works for you, but don&amp;#39;t forget that life can be fun and that just living for the future is not a great idea&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
