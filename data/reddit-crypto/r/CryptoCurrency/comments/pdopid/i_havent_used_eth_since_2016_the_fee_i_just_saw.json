I have never swapped anything before as this stuff wasn&#39;t really around in 2016. I tried to swap $10 USDT into ETH as a test run. </p>\n\n<p>The calculator said it would cost $34 in gas fess. I would literally be losing $24 on that trade. So I just left the USDT in there and I guess it&#39;ll stay there until this gets fixed. </p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m all about decentralization and ETH has been one of my favorite projects since &#39;Nam. But I mean this is just ridiculous now. My bank hasn&#39;t even charged me this much in over 3 years and I have made several thousand transaction with them over the years. One $10 transaction with ETH is $34? Man I almost can&#39;t even believe it. I know about ETH 2.0 but even that has already been pushed back before. </p>\n\n<p>For ETH, I just don&#39;t even see the point of using it anymore, it&#39;s too expensive. When you want to send someone any amount of money, you have to throw a handful of your own cash into the garbage bin.  </p>\n\n<p>I really hope they dev team can fix this issue before it get&#39;s really out of hand. $35 fee on a $1,000 transaction is... understandable, but $10? The barrier for entry will soon be too high for new users to feel comfortable getting into it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
