Just the peace of mind that it was there and I could use it whenever I wanted. Years and years went by and never touched it, so I decided to try and be an adult and invest it in something. Here&#39;s how it went.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Coin</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Price Per Coin</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Investment</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Value Today</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Profit</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Value if sold at ATH</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ETH</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$244.81</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$500</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$4,367.31</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$3,867.31</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">$8,898.72</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">IOTA</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$.59</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$500</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$576.12</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$76.12</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&gt;! $4,449.15 !&lt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">XMR</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$12.85</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$500</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$7,695.71</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$7,195.71</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&gt;! $21,102.34 !&lt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">OMG</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$10.67</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$500</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$175.35</td>\n<td align=\"left\">- $324.65</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&gt;! $1,200.56 !&lt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ARK</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$2.93</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$500</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$155.29</td>\n<td align=\"left\">- $344.71</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&gt;! $1,744.03 !&lt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">TOTAL</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$2,500</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$10,469</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&gt;! $37,394.80 !&lt;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>As you can see, my investments overall did pretty well. If I had just let this sit in my bank account, it would be worth like a few dollars more than what I started with.</p>\n\n<p>I bought OMG and ARK because they were being super-shilled in this sub and at the time I didn&#39;t know any better. I thought this sub was the end-all-be-all of crypto (lmao).</p>\n\n<p>IOTA was being shilled too, but the transactions are instant and free so I figured that would blow up... it kinda did when it went to $5, but not much after that. Not sure why it didn&#39;t blow up.</p>\n\n<p>I bought XMR just because it does what BTC says it does and the community has interesting people/discussions as well. Most of it is over my head though.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, I held through two bull cycles, lost 70% on two investments, and I&#39;m still up about 400% overall. There&#39;s no need to be stressed out guy, just hold for the long-term and you&#39;ll be aight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
