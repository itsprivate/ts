The next project will make you all flithy rich&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;In the Contract, we&#39;ll be able to give up Contract owernship but maintain it, so we won&#39;t be able to rug the liquidity... but we&#39;ll be able to exempt exchanges so we can put it everywhere. And we already have an inside guy too. So we already have a guarantee we&#39;ll be on kucoin with the first two months...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And Thomas only works 15 hours a week&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So we&#39;ll have every milestone video already done&quot; </p>\n\n<p>While this doesn&#39;t directly implicate Safemoon, any reasonable person can conclude the Safemoon was set up in exactly the same manner. Basically a scam token which siphons off liquidity by exempting certain wallets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
