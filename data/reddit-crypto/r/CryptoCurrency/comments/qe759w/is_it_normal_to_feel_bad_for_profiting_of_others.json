And nope zero news whatsoever... just a ton of shilling and hype and getting new suckers to buy into the shitcoin with zero usecase. Someone new would ask if they are still early and how to buy and all the shillers would say “it’s the next Shib” and “hop in don’t miss the 1000x”. </p>\n\n<p>And seeing all the buy orders with some people throwing in thousands I just felt bad. As I was dumping my bags to the next lineup of idiots while making a killing.
