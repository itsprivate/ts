[Scientists discovered back in 2012 that it's possible to create and operate logic gates (transistors) with swarms of soldier crabs](https://interestingengineering.com/crabs-could-run-doom#:~:text=%22Scientists%20have%20also%20successfully%20built,to%20store%20a%20single%20tweet).  I discovered this recently and inmediatly thought 'hey, there's a GPU supply shortage but not a crab supply shortage. What if mining on crabs is the next pro move?' So I had to make some maths. I'm going to tell you how many crabs you need for making a 1GH/s hashrate crab Ethereum mining rig. Let's go:\n\nAn RTX 3080 has a hashrate of approximately 100 MH/s (ethash). That means we need x10 RTX 3080 for achieving 1 GH/s. Wait, do we?\n\nThe RTX 3080's chip GA102-200-K1-A1 has 28.3 billion transistors. We need 10 of them for achieving our hashrate goal so that means we need at least 283 billion transistors.\n\nIt takes 80 soldier crabs to create and operate a transistor. 283.000.000.000 x 80 = 22.640.000.000.000\n\nYou need 22.640.000.000.000 soldier crabs for mining ETH at a 1GH/s hashrate. Easy right?\n\nBut there's more! I also calculated how many crabs you need for mining BTC:\n\nA Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro uses a 5nm architecture chip and gets a 110 TH/s hashrate. A conventional chip's surface size is 14,062 cm\\^2. [In a 5nm architecture chip there are approximately 230.000.000 transistors per square milimeter](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/5_nm_lithography_process). 14,062 cm\\^2 equals 14.062 mm\\^2. 14.062 \\* 230.000.000 = 3.234.260.000.000. There are approximately 3.234.260.000.000 transistors in an Antminer S19 Pro. That means we would need 3.234.260.000.000\\*80 = 258.740.800.000.000.000 crabs for mining BTC at a 110 TH/s hashrate. \n\n'How do you keep such an amount of crabs cool? Thats a lot of heat!' You might be thinking. Well, good news! Crabs are totally water proof so you can submerge them in the ocean. Voilá! \n\nYou can also use this knowledge for building a CGPU  (Crab Graphics Processing Unit) for gaming. Who needs GPUs? Go get some crabs!",
