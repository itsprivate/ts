I&#39;m looking at Long term hodl, not a flip or meme coin either.  I may just roll it into my existing projects but I&#39;ve been a bit disconnected on research lately.   </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t need shill posts.  Just want to see what others see as something for me to read into.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: \nthanks all.  Made my move.  Took my gains from Ada, went to another playground.  Need to see innovation not imitation.  </p>\n\n<p>No hard feeling Charles.  You insulted us all enough in public to even care anymore.    Wish Ada the best in Africa.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
