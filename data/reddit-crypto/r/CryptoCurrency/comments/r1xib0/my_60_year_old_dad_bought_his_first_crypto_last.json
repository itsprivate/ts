He considers the current prices too high and fears a crash to below 50k. When he told me this I explained to him that he could DCA weekly and he liked that idea. </p>\n\n<p>A little back story: two months ago my dad asked me how my Bitcoin is doing. He knows I first got into crypto in Dec 2017 and has occasionally asked me about it through the years but he never felt like buying crypto up until now. So for a few weeks we&#39;ve spoken about crypto and he would ask me a lot of questions. I made sure to answer all questions objectively and made him very much aware of the risks involved. In fact, I placed a lot of emphasis on the risks. He thought about it for a while and then asked me to help him get started. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward and now he&#39;s &quot;decrypting the crypto&quot; ðŸ˜‚ (When he says this to my mom, she just rolls her eyes) Yes, he now refers to it as crypto and no longer as Bitcoin. I would mostly talk about sports and cars with my dad but now we&#39;re talking about crypto too and I just love it. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m rooting for him. I think it would be pretty cool if he made more gains than me. Only time will tell.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
