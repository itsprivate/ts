My own personal thoughts are that if you an owner of any coin, any coin at all, then you are subject to centralization, on one level or another, to that coin. Using bitcoin as an example, for the longest time 60% of the hashrate was all in one province in China at one point and while the present situation is not ideal, it&#39;s better than before.                </p>\n\n<p>Be kind to one another, guys.
