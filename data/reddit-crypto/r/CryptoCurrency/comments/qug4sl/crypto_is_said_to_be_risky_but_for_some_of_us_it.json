Well, it shouldn&#39;t have been!</p>\n\n<p>The property price is growing at a ridiculous rate. However, the salary and wage is growing at such a slow pace. For a GenZ like me the dream of owning a house is a long long way out. </p>\n\n<p>It feels the system is designed in a way where people can be controlled better by keeping us in debt. </p>\n\n<p>Our only way out seems high gains from assets like Cryptocurrency. Because no way can we afford our dream of a nice little house with our everyday wage. </p>\n\n<p>People say Crypto is risky. However, I believe Crypto gives a lot of us a shot to the future we deserve. Crypto, for many, is all we have. </p>\n\n<p>It does not matter what coins you are into. We all are here to make our lives better one way or the another. We might not have made it. But we are atleast trying in our own ways. And, for that, we all need to be proud of ourselves.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
