It was solely to discuss the problems some Twitter users had with Cardano DeFi projects and I asked if someone more tech savvy and more  experience with Cardano  tech can further explain the problem that Twitter users reported. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, I have received hostile messages from a lot of Cardano community members and even the popular YouTuber ‘Altcoin Daily’, accusing me of spreading “coordinated FUD” against Cardano. </p>\n\n<p>There is 0 proof that this is a coordinated FUD attack on Cardano and the fact that the youtuber ‘Altcoin Daily’ is accusing me of spreading FUD and having “proofs”, which absolutely is not true, is just plain slander against me. </p>\n\n<p>I find it very toxic how hostile and aggressive the Cardano community responded to my thread and how the YouTuber ‘Altcoin Daily’ is accusing me doing a coordinated FUD attack. If he has proofs he can show them, or I will take legal action against him for accusing me of spreading misinformation in a coordinated matter.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I tried to communicate in a civil manner and tried to address the FUD accusations. I got downvoted to hell, threatened, gaslighted, and called a lier and FUDer.</p>\n\n<p>I will clarify it once again to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>I did NOT aim to spread FUD against Cardano.\nI am NOT part of some group or a coordinated Cardano FUD attack campaign.\nI NEVER intended to damage Cardano. </p>\n\n<p>If Altcoin Daily has any proofs that  tried to FUD or that I am part of some group or coordination against Cardano then he shall present these proofs or delete the video of him calling me a FUDer, liar and manipulator and apologize.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
