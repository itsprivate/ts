  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>BAT stands for  Basic Attention Token</p>\n\n<p>They aim to &quot;solve the endemic inefficiencies and privacy violations hobbling the digital ad industry.&quot;Basically advertisers like Google, who probably know more about you than you know about yourself. The targeted ads on every single website you go to happens behind your back, and you can do little to control your privacy. For example: You go look at a new gaming keyboard or something along that lines. You visit (Brand A), but you leave their website after. 2 minutes later you have multiple ads from (Brand B), (Brand C) and (Brand D). Google knows that you went on (Brand A)&#39;s website to look at a keyboard, and starts forcing other keyboard ads in your face. It&#39;s an invasion of privacy, and as I said, you can do little to control it.</p>\n\n<p>Why the project has been insanely successful is because of its integration with the Brave Browser, which is also privacy orientated. Brave lets you choose what kind of ads you get, rewarding you partially for viewing ads, and also calculating your attention span. From <a href=\"https://brave.com\">brave.com</a> &quot; You can control every aspect of Brave Ads — from the number of system notifications you’d like to see, to whether or not you want to hide sponsored images. You’ll earn 70% of the ad revenue that we receive from advertisers. In exchange for your attention, you’ll accumulate tokens as you browse. You can contribute these tokens to the sites you love — with more options coming later. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Fun Fact, Brave is also built on the Chromium base which browsers like Chrome and Edge are also built on.</p>\n\n<p>Why I believe BAT is rising:I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s just following the trend, hitchhiking along with other coins, but also because it&#39;s mission is getting the attention of some media and investors. BAT has a purpose, and Brave&#39;s browser is gaining popularity, not just because you can earn some crypto on it, but also because of its built in privacy features. (Think of it like duckduckgo but you can earn a little $) It has long term potential, as intrusive advertising sites, (EX: FACEBOOK) will face lots of laws/regulations about their invasive techniques, more people will become cautious about using the internet, and wanting to stay safe. BAT has short AND long term potential.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>BAT has spiked to $1.33, with a $1,977,737,669 market cap.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about BAT read <a href=\"https://basicattentiontoken.org/\">https://basicattentiontoken.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Brave: <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">https://brave.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for listening to my ted talk.</p>\n\n<p>(I earn an average of 12-20 bat tokens a month)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>YOU CAN WATCH YOUTUBE WITHOUT ADS</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
