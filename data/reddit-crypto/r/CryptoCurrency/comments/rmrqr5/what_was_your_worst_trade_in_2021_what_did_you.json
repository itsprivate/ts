Guess what? It didn&amp;#39;t hit my AVG. ever and as it was going down again, I always found an excuse not to sell, because it will go up again and when I finally decided to DCA out, it has tanked back to February levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime MATIC had at least 3-4 dips and back from 1.8$ back to 2.2 which would have been perfect buying opportunities to DCA into the asset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What ifs are the worst in this market and it will eat your soul...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
