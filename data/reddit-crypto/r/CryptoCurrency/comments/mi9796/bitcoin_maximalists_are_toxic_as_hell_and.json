They degrade and insult any newcomer that shows even a little bit of interest in any other altcoin. They call people holding anything other than Bitcoin “shitcoiners”.\n\nReally? Absolutely no other technology will have any utility other than Bitcoin? Nothing? Smart contracts have absolutely no value? The fact that you can have programmable money has no value? DeFi and providing liquidity to millions of unbanked people has no value? NFTs have no value? Come on. \n\nI think this is a very closed-minded and insecure mentality. It really feels like a cult. If the slightest mention of any coin other than BTC triggers you so much that you have to resort to name calling, it’s really telling of your intellect and position. I think it’s hilarious that you can’t even admit some of the obvious shortcomings in Bitcoin and some of the innovations of other coins. “Peer to peer electronic cash”. Lol. There is such a vast ecosystem out there and this cultish behavior just stifles adoption and scares away a lot of newcomers.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m not saying Bitcoin is bad or will fail- I love BTC and want it to succeed. I’m just annoyed at the closed mindedness and cultish behavior. This is not a zero-sum winner takes all game. Multiple coins can exist and serve multiple use cases. \n\nThese people are mainly notoriously active on Twitter and a new social media app called Clubhouse. The recent drama with [Lex Fridman](https://youtu.be/yB5WGV4zlgw) really opened my eyes to how toxic this community is. I think Lex is a great guy who often spreads love and positivity and they even managed to vilify him lol. I would love for the cryptocurrency community to be much more accepting and put forward thoughtful arguments instead of resorting to insults. \n\ntl;dr - Bitcoin maximalism is a toxic insecure cult that can’t handle any other coin seeing success and they spread unnecessary negativity in the crypto community.\n\nEdit: lol some butthurt people are downvoting this thread and all the comments under it hard.",
