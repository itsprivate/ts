So imagine my shock when I was sat in bed on this fine Sunday morning and saw 12.5 NANO SAT IN A PARK LESS THAN 45 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE.\n\nI dashed to my nearest bus stop, excitedly working out the current value of 12.5 Nano, barely believing my luck. Isn’t crypto great? One second you’re sat chilling, the next someone has left £100 of real money in a park for anyone to pick up.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I finally get there and make my way to the payout spot. I had to be within 30m, and as walked around a lake nearby I struggled to work out exactly where this mystical Nano was. Where exactly was the spot named “fancy a dip” where my bounty was? I zoomed in. Then it hit me... 30m is a canny short range, but the spot should have been to my right... exactly where the lake was and completely inaccessible.\n\nA quick Google of “can you spoof your GPS location on iPhone” later, and I’m sat back on the bus empty handed. I’d be angry if it wasn’t so funny. Game recognises game.\n\nTL;DR - There’s 12.5 nano sat in Regents Park, London. You just have to swim for it in a swan infested lake.",
