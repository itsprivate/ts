Moons cost money, so therefore, upvoting = money. Although they don’t cost much, I’ve seen what they can do to people living in some of the more poorer countries. They’ve probably literally helped feed communities of people.\n\nWith that being said, a lot of people are a whole lot more picky with who they give their upvote to. I’d say that this is nice because people take longer to consider what content is worth giving a moon to. It makes it so that only useful information and top-tier shitposts can get through this “moon-filter.”\n\nOr so I thought. Recently I’ve noticed that people have been *downvoting* in an attempt to choke the oh-so-precious moon-supply. \n\nAgain, don’t get me wrong. Moons are incredible and life-changing. I like them, but other people around the world have a bigger and better need/use for them. So the fact that human greed is leading some people to try to choke the supply of moons is beyond absurd. \n\nI understand punishing an obvious karma-farming post with a downvote, but downvoting useful *information?* Again, absurd.\n\nWith that being said, I feel as though moons should instead be based on awards. So now, ideas can get upvoted, and can be rewarded moons via actual awards. Feel free to add your ideas and opinions.\n\ntl;dr: Moons made people greedy enough to downvote useful information.",
