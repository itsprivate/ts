Currently its $9.99 and down 32% from 30 days ago and 66% from ATH. Remember that everything is pumping now. I know its not just an oracle but I expected a lot more activity from it. And Cardano doesnt seem to care much for it..hopefully things change.</p>\n\n<p>VET, the amazing and superb VET that will clean the oceans, track food, produce and so on. It&#39;s been going sideways for so long that I dont even remember. It&#39;s currently valued at $0.11 and keeps the price steadier than a stablecoin.</p>\n\n<p>And LTO? Yeah, 70% down from the ATH a few months ago with no recovery in sight.   </p>\n\n<p>I listened and was hyped enough to buy these (apart from LTO) and I know I&#39;ll get a lot of faeces thrown at me for posting this but this sub is a circlejerk echo chamber. </p>\n\n<p>See you tomorrow guys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
