Though this looks like a massive number, how does it compare to Doge&#39;s current Circulating Supply?</p>\n\n<p>Doge right now rounded up has a circulating supply of <strong>131 Billion DOGE</strong>. If we were to add these newly minted coins (making the <strong>circulating supply 136,256,000,000</strong>), <strong>3.85% DOGE</strong> is added to the supply in a years time. Because there will always be <strong>10,000 DOGE</strong> added per minute, the % rate of new Doge created will continuously go down. So how about the years that follow?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2021-2022 - 3.85%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2022-2023 - 3.71%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2023-2024 - 3.58%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2024-2025 - 3.45%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2025-2026 - 3.34%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2026-2027 - 3.23%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2027-2028 - 3.13%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2028-2029 - 3.03%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 8 years, we will see Doge very slowly drop to around 3% inflation, and will continue to lower as long as it uses this system.</p>\n\n<p>DOGE&#39;s only use-case argument is as a store of value to be used for transactions. In other words, it wants to compete with fiat currencies to be used in stores (not as an investment). Do you believe with its current inflation rate that this is possible?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I&#39;m not into Doge and do not believe it to be a strong investment. But maybe we over-hype the infinite inflation argument if its use-case argument is as a transactional crypto. What do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
