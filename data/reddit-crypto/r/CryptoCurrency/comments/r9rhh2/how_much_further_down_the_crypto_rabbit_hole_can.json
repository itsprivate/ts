I started by watching all the MIT Gary Gensler lectures, all of the videos where  Micheal Saylor proved he was a maximalist. I read books trying to understand the gold standard, the bitcoin standard, where Peter Schift is coming from. I reading the white paper again and again, understanding byzantine, and then others.             &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past year I&amp;#39;ve learned &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To code hashes and blockchains in python, &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Staking and swapping&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tax laws in both my countries, &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to spot good/bad news article&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tracked hash rates moving to North America &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Charted on chain metrics &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Watched interview after interview &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read about the fourth turning demographic crisis era, of new digital internet money revolution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participated in macroeconomic lectures and seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I get it.&lt;/em&gt; I think most of us here do.          &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where does it stop? I feel like I’ve gotten the equivalent of a bachelors degree in DeFi market finance having been hyper obsessed the past many months. What’s next? Do I learn how to build my own cryptos? Learn Haskell? Do I start trading evolving NFTs ‘for the tech’? Set up nodes just for principles sake?              &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve become desensitized to the volatility and have just decided not to sell until 2033. What do I do till then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
