Diversify. \n-Move profits to a stable coin that gives good APY\n-Always have money available for buying dips. \n-If a coin is mooning, sell half your position and hold the other half. \n-Be smart and don’t FOMO. Have set goals in mind before opening a position. \n-Watch out for phishing scams! They are ramping up a lot this week! </p>\n\n<p>Happy crypto trading people!
