When I&#39;m 65 I retire and get enough money from the government to live a normal life until I die. No questions asked.</p>\n\n<p>But what if I lose my job? Well then I get money from the government to live a normal life for years and in that time frame I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;ll find a new job.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you or your family have a medical emergency? Then I go to the doctor I guess, which sends me to the hospital or wherever I need to get what I need, sure I would pay a little bit but not really something I&#39;d have to worry about.</p>\n\n<p>Even if all those those things happened to me at once I&#39;d probably do just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and by the way, don&#39;t think I have a good job. I wash dishes and my gf works cleaning in a hotel. Although its relative, compared to most of the world its great, just in the context of where I live, they&#39;re low paying jobs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
