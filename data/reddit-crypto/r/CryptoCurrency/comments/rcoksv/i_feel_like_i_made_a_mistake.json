  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a small amount of money (to me) in crypto through October.  In late October, I decided to slap a larger chunk of change into crypto.  The market was booming and media analysts were calling for $100k BTC by EoY, $10k ETH by EoY.  Reddit DD wasn’t that different, most was very optimistic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can say I FOMO’d, but I did not buy all at once.  Tried to DCA in.  Over the course of several weeks I gradually bought various coins trying to average in but quick enough to maximize my gains.  The prices just kept climbing and climbing.  15% gain was mild and normal.  Some were hitting 80-90% in a day.  I thought this might be retail adoption/influx of new investors driving price up and $10k ETH was imminent.  About 1-2 weeks after the money I allocated was invested, the market tanked.  What. The. Fuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever it was (omicron, govt bill, Evergrande, etc) it doesn’t matter.  I’m pretty sure I’m in the red now and really can’t sell until I get back to breaking even.  You don’t lose money until you sell.  (By the way it would be great if CB or CB Pro displayed unrealized gains/losses.  When I try to upload my transactions to Coin tracker.io the upload fails due to no transactions rows found.  Tried emailing support but no response.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought some BTC at 35k and some ETH at 3,700 but bought a majority of BTC in the mid 60s.  I definitely bought some at $68k too.  Similar situation with ETH.  I don’t worry about ETH though.  The later purchases feel like a mistake now.  Seeing red almost every day is tough.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Yes, I know this is not get rich quick.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Yes, I did DYOR .&lt;br/&gt;\n- Yes, I know the market fluctuates and is tied to BTC and the stock market in a way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I make a mistake with my timing?  I’ve been beating myself up mentally.  It seems far fetched to think that BTC will reach $68k again before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good chunk of my portfolio is in CRO as well.  I just don’t understand why the price is suppressed.  With all the marketing lately and announcements it seems like it should be skyrocketing.  I see it mentioned here in almost every other thread lately.  Last week they bought a Us exchange.  Why didn’t it pump?  What’s keeping the price from climbing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
