Trying to preddict the price never worked for me and in 90% of the time when I sold, I would always stay locked on my phone checking the prices every 10-15 minutes.When Im outside with my friends I would check the prices untill the battery dries out. Ofc as many of you when I sell price goes up more, when I buy prices goes down and it was like a vicious circle. </p>\n\n<p>I figured out that I should just buy, hold and rebuy if I trully believe in the coin project because that way is stress free for me. I know I should start doing the trading more often and learn how to control myaelf but at this point I feel safe in the HODL bubble.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
