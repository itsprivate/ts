For perspective: I’m 21 and I’m fond of the idea of decentralized currency for the mere sense you don’t have to rely on your nation’s currency to hold value over time &amp;amp; instead a currency you have more faith in, with utility outside of simply holding value. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffet has infamously preached for you to put together a list of 10-20 investments you would make if they were the only investments you’re allowed for your entire life. This is what we need to be doing with crypto ESPECIALLY. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to have a bag in a shitcoin trust me I got to Shib at .0000015 and i love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT- It’s time to put together your list of Blue Chip Coins for 20 years down the line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My top 5 positions in order:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AMP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ALGO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ADA &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
