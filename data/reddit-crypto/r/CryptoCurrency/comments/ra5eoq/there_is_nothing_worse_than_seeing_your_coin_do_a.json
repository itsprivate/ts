In just a week I turned out right and got a 2x . This is where I considered selling my initial investment and let the rest ride. But like every time I Held it tight. It did go up by more 50% only to comeback to price I got the coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now ,I know I should buy the dip , but it would have been a lot sweeter if I could just buy &amp;quot;the dip &amp;quot; with my initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some might argue , that if the coin had gone up 10x , I would lose about 50% of the profits. But come to think of it a 5x isn&amp;#39;t that bad either without any risk . If I were to sell at a 2x , I would basically get a free asset with all of my money back , plus all that peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has happened numerous times where I kept holding it , just to come back at the same price or even worse go in a loss . Booking profits doesn&amp;#39;t sound bad at all , especially after a 2x.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
