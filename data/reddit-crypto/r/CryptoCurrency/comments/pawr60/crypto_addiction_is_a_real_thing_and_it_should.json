Especially in this subreddit I have seen many threads/comments that show signs of an addiction. Around 1% of crypto traders develop a severe addiction while 10% experience problems related to crypto trading. And I would dare to say that these numbers are still pretty conservative. </p>\n\n<p>One of the most important reasons why crypto can be so addictive is of course its extreme price volatility. Some fast gains, chasing the next high and leverage trading can all be very addictive. At some point we should stop speaking of investing or trading and start speaking of gambling.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about crypto addiction in <a href=\"https://www.familyaddictionspecialist.com/blog/staring-at-charts-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-addiction\">this article</a> while <a href=\"https://castlecraig.co.uk/help-advice/guide-to-cryptocurrency-addiction\">here</a> you can check if you are in danger and how you can seek help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
