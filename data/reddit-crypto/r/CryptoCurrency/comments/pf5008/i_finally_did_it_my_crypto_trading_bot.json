  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been a pain to optimise and test out this strategy but I finally managed to successfully place a buy order on a newly listed coin.</p>\n\n<p>The testing has probably been the most difficult part of the whole process. Every time I would start the algorithm, I would have to wait there for days at a time before it does anything. Then Binance decides to list a new coin, and the script breaks. Go in and fix the error, re-start the script.</p>\n\n<p>Rinse and repeat this a few times over two weeks, it was tedious and required a lot of patience but I fucking did it. I can now confidently call the script functional (with some minor bugs that I will fix in the coming days).</p>\n\n<p><strong>So here&#39;s what actually happened:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The algorithm detected GNO as a new listing yesterday at 6:00AM UTC, and placed a buy order at 6:00.02. The order was placed at 394 USDT and GNO peaked at 418 but the entry price was closer to 300.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that even with 0.2s speed of execution the tool is still too slow to buy at the listed price and needs additional improvements.</p>\n\n<p>It ended up selling at 3% loss - which might not seem like an achievement, but I am personally very happy with the fact that it actually works, and this gives me a good base to make the necessary improvements in order to optimise this strategy.</p>\n\n<p>I do think that, if optimised correctly this tool can actually work very well. I will keep making improvements and report back. If you&#39;re curious to know more about how the bot works and how this buy order performed, I just made a new video explaining all of that in more detail: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI\"><strong>https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>And for those who asked for the guide, here you go:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/\">https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>The code is open source and available to everyone to use: <a href=\"https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins\">https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"/u/steks13\">/u/steks13</a> for improving the speed of execution buddy!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
