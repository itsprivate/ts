The owner of the email will receive an email letting them know they have some cryptocurrency waiting for them. Once they open an account, whatever you sent them will be propagated on it.\n\nIf anyone knows of any other options like this to gift cryptocurrency to someone without a wallet, please let me know and I'll edit it into the post.",
