But the problem is that A LOT of the FUD that newcomers feel, actually come from the crappy Youtubers, with their shitty “😱😱🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕📈📈📉📉” thumbnails.\n\nImagine you finally bought some Bitcoin, maybe you bought it at 60k, and you see the market going 10% down. You invested in crypto, and it’s your first experience with volatility.\n\nYou go to YouTube, and your homepage is now flooded with “THE MARKET IS TANKING 😱😱😱😱😱💥💥💥” “BITCOIN BEAR MARKET”.\n\nHow do you think this would make you feel if you just came to the cryptocurrency market? I personally would feel a lot of fear, and try to cut my losses, as I wouldn’t know what any of this meant. Now I take a loss, and the market starts going up, and then I buy...and the cycle continues. It’s the meme of buy high, sell low...but although it is a joke, it does happen to a lot of people.\n\nWe need to help the people that feel this way, by giving them reassurance. By not letting their emotions take over. I try to do this on the daily discussion, and maybe if you read this far, you could also jump in sometimes.\n\nHope everyone has a lovely weekend!",
