For instance: In the recent May-2021 crypto market crash, till 19th May, BTC lost value by 50%, ETH by 45%, ADA by 50%, BNB by 50%, from their respective All-Time-Highs, and almost every major coin was down by double-digit percentages (<a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/commodities/story/crypto-in-free-fall-bitcoin-tanks-30-to-31000-ethereum-loses-40-dogecoin-down-45-296457-2021-05-19\">source</a>). So be mindful that you might have to HODL your coins for 3-4 years just to break even. Remember, Crypto is a cutting-edge solution to a lot of problems, but making a quick buck is not one of them. Therefore only invest funds that you won&#39;t be needing anytime soon.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not invest what you don&#39;t own. Borrowing money to invest in Crypto can literally <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-short-squeeze-bitcoin-liquidation-short-trading-margin-options-bearish-2021-7\">financially destroy you</a>. It doesn&#39;t matter how optimistic the market sentiment seems, or how confident you are that every statistical parameter seems bullish-do not overleverage.</li>\n<li>In a bull market, it is easy to day-trade and think you can time the market to make a quick buck. It&#39;s not. Everyone&#39;s thinks he&#39;s a genius in a bull market. I&#39;d suggest staying away from it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is not FUD, <strong>it&#39;s called Risk Management</strong>, and it should be taken very seriously before investing in any financial asset-more so in the case of Crypto, because we are still very early, and crypto still has a relatively small total market cap and has massive potential for growth in this decade.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit-1: Yes, this is a financial advice. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
