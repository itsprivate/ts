My politics is pretty straight forward: I fight corporate power to create economic freedom for everyone. To prove that, I don’t take corporate PAC money. My interest in crypto started back in 2011 as a Senior Advisor at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (founded by Elizabeth Warren) when pioneers in the industry where presenting the technology to us. I didn&#39;t take seriously then but I&#39;ve started to really explore its potential to create economic power for people in places like Ohio.</p>\n\n<p>I recently posted two threads on crypto you can see here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1458064822772375565?s=20\">https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1458064822772375565?s=20</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1463219384776806402?s=20\">https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1463219384776806402?s=20</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My full bio is below.</p>\n\n<p>I was born at The Ohio State University Hospital to a teenager who couldn’t raise me. I lived in a foster home just north of Columbus before being adopted and raised by a Columbus Public Schools teacher who had immigrated to Ohio from Trinidad. My mother, a single-mom, raised me and my brother while going through a bitter divorce that always had us on edge emotionally and financially. But my mother had a stable union job and so whatever energy she had left, she poured it into my education. I got scholarships to attend Columbus Academy and graduated from Tufts, Princeton and Stanford Law School. I then went to work in Washington under the Obama Administration and became a Senior Advisor at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While I was there I went after big banks that were ripping off working people. We sued companies like Wells Fargo for opening fake bank accounts in their customers’ names. </p>\n\n<p>In 2020 I ran for U.S.Congress and although we didn’t win (fuck Covid), we used the grassroots momentum to launch Columbus Stand Up! a community organization that mobilized volunteers across Central Ohio to go door-to-door to distribute 30K masks and drive hundreds of vulnerable people to their vaccine appointments. </p>\n\n<p>While we did great work there one thing continued to stick with me. We know what it would take to protect communities from falling behind. We don’t have an ideas problem. We don’t have a policy problem. <strong>We have a politician problem</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Only two democrats have won statewide in Ohio in the last two decades at the federal level, Barack Obama (2x) and Sherrod Brown. Only way to win Ohio is to turn out 15% of the Black vote. That won’t happen running a Terry McAuliffe type Democrat in Ohio. That’s why I’m running - to win and put the power of our people at the center of our government. </p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to the discussion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
