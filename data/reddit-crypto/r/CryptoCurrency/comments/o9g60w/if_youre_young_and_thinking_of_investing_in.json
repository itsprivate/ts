This community is amazing, dynamic and there&#39;s a ton of potential to make great returns. However, high-risk investments should never be your whole portfolio. It should be the smallest part.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure that you&#39;re setting aside money in a Roth IRA, contributing to your 401k, Vanguard funds, etc. The boring stuff. The stuff that grows slowly over a lifetime. Don&#39;t just diversify your coins, diversify your whole portfolio. It&#39;s something I certainly wish I&#39;d tackled at a much younger age. Believe me, you&#39;ll thank me later.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
