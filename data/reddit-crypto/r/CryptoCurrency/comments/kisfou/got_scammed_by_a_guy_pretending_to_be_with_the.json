I got into the STORMX telegram chat, and this guy, who took the name and profile picture of one of the admins offered to help. He asked for my ETH address, pretended to send it to their Swap TEAM, then sent me a link to a website, where I was going to offer him access to the ETH address. So I started to be suspicious about it, and I moved my ETH to a different address, then logged into that website (I know it is STUPID).\n\nHe saw I moved the money, so he said I should fund some, to be able to swap the STORM. So I added 0.02 ETH to see what's next. He said to add more, so it can be faster :)\n\nSadly I have forgotten about the 200$ worth of FirstBlood tokens that are now gone.\n\nHe also promotes this stuff here on reddit here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/stormxio/comments/k308d8/where\\_to\\_exchange/](https://np.reddit.com/r/stormxio/comments/k308d8/where_to_exchange/) I believe he is the same guy\n\nThis is the website he asked me to use: [https://www.verifyaccounts.io](https://www.verifyaccounts.io/)\n\nMaybe someone can track him down or something, I don't know.\n\nHere is the compromised address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x1bBec401438fFaa1A15eCE0d0528FB9A8B0d5261](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1bBec401438fFaa1A15eCE0d0528FB9A8B0d5261)\n\nI just don't want anyone else to fall into this. This limited time for swapping (I did not keep an eye on the project, but also didn't get any email or anything) that led to this thing makes me wanna stay away from crypto unfortunately. 5 months to swap is not that long, whatever they say.",
