Well, the time is almost up and LRC has continued a downward trend while MATIC has only seen upward trends. Both are layer 2 solutions and with all the good news surrounding Polygon lately that isn’t riding on just hype/a possible announcement, how are you all feeling in regards to LRC and MATIC? I’m hoping that we actually see a LRC announcement before EOY so that I can determine which layer 2 solution to fully invest in, instead of having split investments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this discussion.  I didn’t expect this many people to contribute. Reading over most comments I realize that I still have much to learn and research. Still a crypto noob.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
