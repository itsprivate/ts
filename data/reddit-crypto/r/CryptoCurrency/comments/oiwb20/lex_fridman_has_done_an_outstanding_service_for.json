Over the past several months, he has done a deep dive into crypto starting with the fundamental ideas behind it all the way down to specific use cases and potential threats. I took the dive about 6 months ago and began learning everything I could about crypto, and I wish I would have known about these talks. There is so much good information here, and it&#39;s discussed at a level that makes sense to normal people. I also think Lex is a stand-up guy, never spreading bullshit or trying to sell anything. All he wants to do is understand and help others understand. If you are considering learning more about crypto or if you have people on your life that want to learn, Lex might be a good place to start. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/lexfridman\">https://youtube.com/c/lexfridman</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
