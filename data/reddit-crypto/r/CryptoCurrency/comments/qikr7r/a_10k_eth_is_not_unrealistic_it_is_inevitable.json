The fact that people are willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money for fees highlights how trusted and desirable the Ethereum network is.</p>\n\n<p>Next year, Ethereum will merge to Proof Of Stake. <strong>This is one of the most bullish events that I have ever seen.</strong> The reason for this is that the amount of ETH being created will be reduced by 90%, and ETH will become deflationary.</p>\n\n<p>A deflationary ETH will theoretically continue increasing in price provided that demand remains constant. I think we could see a supply shock where not enough ETH is on exchanges to meet demand which could propel the price very high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: ETH is very underrated. 10k ETH in the next few months is not an unrealistic prediction.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
