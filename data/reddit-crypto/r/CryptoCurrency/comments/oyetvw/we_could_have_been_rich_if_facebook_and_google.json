Corporations like Amazon, Google, and Facebook use the analyses to make more sales by selling this data to companies, who then throw ads in your direction in hopes of you clicking on it and buying their products. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much money do corporations make from your data?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Depending on your search results on Google, what you like and share on Facebook, you could be worth as l<strong>ittle as $2</strong>. If we took global earnings from Facebook and compared it to the number of users, on average, each user is worth <strong>around $30</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>So the real question how would it make you rich in crypto?</strong></p>\n\n<p>now we come to that part were we look at the statistics</p>\n\n<p>A stat say that in every hour Approximately 5 MB of information<em>(taken from google)</em> about us are being collected by The mentioned companies if they have been installed on your phone or anything which supports them. <sup>Mainly android because apple is very strict regarding tracking.</sup></p>\n\n<p>so going into the math behind it </p>\n\n<p>1 hour = 60 minutes</p>\n\n<p>1 MB = 1024 KB</p>\n\n<p>5 MB = 5000 KB</p>\n\n<p>So in a day they collect around 5000 * 24 = 120000 KB of data are being collected</p>\n\n<p>so if they had to pay us 0.00001$ each KB, in a day you could have got -</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1.2$</strong> a day that&#39;s equalent  to  <strong>0.000031 Bitcoin</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>36$</strong> a month that&#39;s equalent <strong>0.00094 Bitcoin</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>436$</strong> a year that&#39;s equalent <strong>0.011 Bitcoin</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You see the....... you aint poor, you just rich intangibly </p>\n\n<p>you have the purchasing power to buy a Bitcoin but unfortunately  you cant ,</p>\n\n<p>if you had DCA&#39;d these money with proper management you might be worth at least 1000$ by now</p>\n\n<p>BUT THINGS DID CHANGE AROUND-</p>\n\n<p>For example Brave browser , that thing is Google Chrome on Steroids, It shows ads but also rewards us with BAT , eventho its  nothing much as a reward but hey we are getting something in return. But i love how it works</p>\n\n<p>Then after all the fuzz about facebook, facebook launched Facebook Study to pay us huge for our data </p>\n\n<p>i had it for a month, installed the app and got 5$ literally for nothing via paypal</p>\n\n<p>now google has its own rewarding system but it is reserved to just its recommended members.</p>\n\n<p>so yeah thats it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit : THE WORD &#39;COULD&#39; IN THE TITLE IS THERE FOR A REASON.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
