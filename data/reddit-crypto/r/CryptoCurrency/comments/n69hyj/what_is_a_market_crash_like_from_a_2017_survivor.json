This time is NOT different, I feel a nice big build-up of sick in the back of my throat when I read \"This time is different\". I have seen this in 2014 and 2017. Does that mean I don't think this space has progressed or there are more institutional investors? No, what I mean to say is this time is no different than any other asset class and after a big pump/market surge, a correction/crash is INEVITABLE. This will happen, we just don't know when. If you don't believe this, I would suggest, take the tin foil off your head and go outside. \n\nWhat a crash does is really highlight the flaws in your investments. In 2017, it hit be like a train would hit a marshmallow. I had failed to follow simple guidance. I had invested far too much money then I could afford to lose/go down 90% and my portfolio was far to weighted in moon shots/alts. As a result, I felt the crash hard. What we know from previous crashes, and highly likely to happen in future crashes is when BTC poops itself, the alts get Dehli belly to the extreme and will crash FAR harder. This is the risk you take in alts, they have more upside potential, but boy oh boy do they have downside potential as well. \n\nDon't start losing your head because crypto is earning you more than your actual fiat mining job. Get a grip and don't go FOMOing into any random moonshot and come crying to this sub when it crashes 99.99%. You cannot seriously accept the amazing potential of picking the right alt that blows 100-1000x but when it does the same the other way go, hey what gives?\n\nAs we get closer and closer to a market top, more and more fresh blood and new faces will be FOMOing and likely not into BTC and ETH due to common misconceptions that they are too expensive/gains aren't as much as other coins. These people, in particular, a word of warning, remember you HAVE to be prepared for a crash at some point. It is a certainty. We just don't know when. When making investing decisions in this space, just keep that at the back of your mind. \n\nIn all seriousness, I've been in dark places when it crashed, don't be me, be better.",
