I&amp;#39;ll admit that I&amp;#39;m not one of those folks that spends time researching coins. To be honest, I only read the white paper and looked at their initiatives and collaborations. As a result, I&amp;#39;ve got MATIC, DOT, ETH, and CRO. Anyway, I&amp;#39;m hoping I don&amp;#39;t get chastised for not conducting thorough research before purchasing coins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#39;s the deal with Polygon (matic) right now? Where do you think it’s going? (Speculations). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brief Polygon info: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Polygon is a framework for building interconnected blockchain networks.
