Rinse, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen it MULTIPLE times this year and the only thing to remember is this: there are hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars worth of large Whale holdings... Do you seriously think those big players would ever swallow so much fresh fish that they&amp;#39;d choke?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, they wouldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So stop giving them discounted coins and remember that there is only one thing which matters in crypto: you never make a loss &lt;strong&gt;until&lt;/strong&gt; you sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
