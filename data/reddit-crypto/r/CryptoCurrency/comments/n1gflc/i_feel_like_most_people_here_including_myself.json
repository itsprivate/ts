The first thing we do after waking up is checking out exchange, then we spend hours a day researching and thinking about all the amazing project out there. While this doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, I am sure a lot of people get too sucked up and are really emotional about their investments.\n\nWe all want to make gains, but constantly checking won't help, it will only lead to stress. Cryptos are amazing and its easy to get sucked up in this huge new world full of promising technology, but we all have to think about our mental health, too\n\nSo what I want to say is relax, take a step back and hodl for the long term. Day trading will most likely be less efficient for you anyways, so why bother checking the charts every few minutes? Just buy crypto and stay informed, but don't forget about all of your other hobbies. Do things that make you happy and see crypto as what is: an investment, not a hobby.\n\nI kinda want to add that part of the reason why I wrote this post is that I want to stop myself from behaving like this lol",
