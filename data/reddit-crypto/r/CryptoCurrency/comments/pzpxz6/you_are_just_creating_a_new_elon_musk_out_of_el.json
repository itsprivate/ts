Not from El Salvador, but from the same God forsaken region.</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you this: Latin American politicians are pretty much the last people you&#39;d like to praise or emulate in any way. The general rule of thumb is that, if someone is a successful politician in Latin America, he is probably a legit scumbag. He&#39;s either involved with organized crime, or he&#39;s undemocratic to the core and only sees the state and the people as a toy to exploit at will.</p>\n\n<p>Just because this particular dude did for crypto something we were all hoping for, It does not mean that he is an enlightened and benevolent ruler. He made one apparently good decision, but we don&#39;t know how this will play out in his country, if the legislation surrounding the adoption of crypto is fair, and if the common people will truly benefit from this (and not only him and his entourage).</p>\n\n<p>It could well be that, in a couple of months from now, corruption scandals and other unpleasant surprises regarding bitcoin in El Salvador come to surface and, in turn, discourage or hinder adoption in other countries. Maybe it could spook monetary authorities elsewhere and harden existing regulations.</p>\n\n<p>So, as we all saw happen with Elon Musk, this is just a reminder not to place someone on a pedestal just because that one time he did something nice for crypto. Keep things in perspective, always.</p>\n\n<p>Peace.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
