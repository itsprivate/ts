The guy who got the reward immediately sent around $5k to Vitalik lol. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile the hacker got swamped by beggars, asking him for money. Some were recommending him tips on how to launder (like using Tornado Cash) and looking for a reward.  </p>\n\n<p>Im not sure if the hacker is really unaware of dapps like Tornado Cash but anyways he seemed to play along and asked people &quot;TEACH ME PLZ!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing is like watching money heist IRL lol </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile the polynetwork team posted a cringy message asking the hacker to return the funds otherwise there will be legal consequences. </p>\n\n<p>The hacker then said he is not interested in the money, and his latest message seems to indicate he will create a token and the DAO will decide on the fate. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xc8a65fadf0e0ddaf421f28feab69bf6e2e589963\">https://etherscan.io/address/0xc8a65fadf0e0ddaf421f28feab69bf6e2e589963</a></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile people pour in asking him for money. Over 600 people have sent txns asking for mone.y Some people really seem to think he will distribute the hacked amount to the people who are begging for it lol. I wont be surprised if he did, crazier things have happened in crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
