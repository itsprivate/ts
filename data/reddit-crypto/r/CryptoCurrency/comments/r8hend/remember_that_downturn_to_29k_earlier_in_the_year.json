That&amp;#39;s twice in 1 year. Historically, BTC has never done that, not at the current price levels anyway. Did anyone predict it? Not to my knowledge, everyone was sure the early bear market was here. Point? Don&amp;#39;t listen to anyone but your own intuition and sobriety after your research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
