Banks know they can&amp;#39;t compete for shit, so they choose to sue any competition for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost every other western country in the world allow their citizens the freedom to choose where to deposit their money. The SEC threatening to sue any competition just shows how miserable and desperate they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
