On the other side, it probably wont see a 100x in the next 10 years like maybe some very few altcoins could see. But I dont really know.\n\nHowever, at least to me, it really seems hard to estimate which altcoins are good and have potential. Of course there are obvious cases where you know to stay away from them. But I noticed that my mind often wonders if I put the part of my portfolio, dedicated to altcoins, into the \"right\" altcoins. Also staying up to date with the development progress in a number of altcoins feels sometimes like a hassle to me.\n\nI know that there are good basic portfolios rules about allocation of BTC/ETH and altcoins like 80%/20% or 50%/30%/20%, however does anybody else have the idea to go 100% BTC from time to time?",
