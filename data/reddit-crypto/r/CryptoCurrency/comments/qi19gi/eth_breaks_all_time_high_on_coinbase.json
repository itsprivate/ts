My fellow folks that bought near the ATH earlier this year and held through the dark days, I toast to you. Hopefully you were able to DCA through the months. Congrats everyone holding ETH! Here’s to $10k before the end of the year 📈📈</p>\n\n<p>Comedy because I tried really really hard to be the first one to post this, probably like many others. Let’s see who has the quickest internet fingers 👀</p>\n\n<p>Also my life is a joke</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It seems that, according to a few comments here, ETH is not really the people’s crypto after all because of gas fees. I apologize. And my fingers are indeed the quickest. And nobody else really posted about the ATH 🤡🤡</p>\n\n<p>Edit again: Changed flair from comedy so I can get moons for the ETH hype. How does that work? Is this still counted as a comedy post or general-news for moons?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
