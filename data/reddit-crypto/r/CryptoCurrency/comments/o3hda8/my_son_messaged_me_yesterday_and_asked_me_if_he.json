C is my son, M is me:\n\nC: Hey I might buy into SHIBA INU\n\nC: buy like 100m shares and once it hits a penny or whatever. BOOM.\n\nM: lmfao\n\nC: Don't laugh at me\n\nM: If Shiba hit a penny it would be worth all the money currently in circulation (I hadn't done the math yet, until a couple of seconds later)\n\nM: It's not that extreme but to hit 0.01, its market cap would be $3,900,000,000,000 which is currently nearly 6x higher than Bitcoin's cap and 2.6x higher than the market cap of all crypto currently just to put it into perspective\n\nC: Oh\n\nM: Yeah there are 394 trillion SHIBA they did that probably to fool people into thinking they're getting a great deal by being able to buy over 1 million of them for $100 (I'm not sure if that's the reason; I've never really looked into SHIBA and haven't read the whitepaper, if they even have one)\n\nC: Having a million of them would be awesome though would you buy them for me if I sent you the money?\n\nM: If you want them so badly, buy them yourself.\n\nC (a couple of hours later): I can't figure out how to do it can you help me out please?\n\nM: Nah if you can't figure it out, you probably shouldn't be 'investing' in SHIBA.\n\nC: wow you're being a dick\n\nM: It's called tough love, son\n\nMaybe I am being a dick. He gave me $100 in January and told me to invest in whatever I thought was good. I put it into ALGO for him. He gave me a point in which to sell (if/when the investment hits 10x) and hadn't messaged me about investing anything until Dogecoin FOMO hit him when it was around 0.60. This is the 2nd time he's messaged me about SHIBA, the first time was to get my opinion on it.\n\nOn the one hand, I'll feel pretty bad if SHIBA goes the way of Dogecoin and ends up exploding even more than it already has, and his $1000 he wants to throw at it ends up being a multi-bagger for him. On the other hand, I'm worried about him just hearing about some shit coin somewhere down the grapevine, investing and the rug being pulled out from under him.\n\nI think it's funny and sad how when I told him to invest in SHIBA himself, he got flustered and messaged me back admitting he couldn't figure it out and asking me to just do it for him. I know that he was trying to figure it out that entire ~2 hours but couldn't figure out how to use an exchange (that isn't Coinbase) to complete the transaction. I really meant what I said, that if he couldn't figure it out, that he shouldn't make the investment. \n\nI plan making the 3 hour drive up to see him next Wednesday when we're both off to hang out and to answer any of his crypto questions that he may have and that I am able to give an informed answer on. I'm not sure what compelled me to share this; I just thought y'all might like to see what someone who knows nothing about crypto's thought process (like him thinking that SHIBA will hit 0.01 without understanding market cap or just how many SHIBA are out there).",
