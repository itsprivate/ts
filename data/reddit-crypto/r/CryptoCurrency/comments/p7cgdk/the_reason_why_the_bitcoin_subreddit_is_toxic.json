And honestly, I am baffled. Here is a small summary of the events on why I got banned - and why I think that subreddit and the moderators are the most toxic in the crypto community.</p>\n\n<p>It all started with the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/KqbX6iO\">following question</a> I saw on my timeline. For those who don&#39;t want to click the link, the question states: &quot;What do you guys think of Ethereum? Is it a good coin compared to Bitcoin?&quot; OP then specified he asked this on <a href=\"/r/ethereum\">r/ethereum</a> but wanted to see both sides of the story.</p>\n\n<p>I answered with the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Mt98N4k\">following answer.</a> Again for all of you who don&#39;t want to click links, it states from my side: </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Different coin all along.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin = store of value (like gold, but with a known supply).</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum = platform to facilitate contracts &amp; finance.</p>\n\n<p>They are both good. I own both!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>A few minutes after, I get <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/UnwVAYx\">the following DM</a> on my Reddit account stating I was now banned from the community for 7 days due to &quot;shitcoin shilling&quot; LMFAO.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I did not shill I believe. Secondly, as if now Ethereum is a shitcoin!?</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, rant over. For all you newbies out there, be careful with coin-focused subreddits... as you can see they tend to be very one-sided.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Upon popular request, I will next week post in their subreddit a shilling on doge and an explanation on why a flippening will happen in 2027. I’m setting it on fire now</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
