That simply means it can never be worth that much less than a dollar.\n\nThey basically figured out how to be an exchange without actually being an exchange.  They just let other exchanges do all the work for them.  They take a really tiny fraction of the fees to use it, and simply reinvest it into a bank, and for each $1 profit put back to the bank creates another tether.  The trading volume is always consistently high.  They will keep growing and growing and growing.\nIf they are allowed to still operate , and crypto sticks around for another few decades they might eventually take the number one away from BTC at $1ea\n\nI personally believe they started off inflated, gained money fast, and was able to reinvest back in before anyone could audit. But who knows. That's what I like to think. I'm happy that way. ðŸ˜†\n\n##**Hshare** #28\n\nGone.\nNot sure where they went. Did they change their name?

Doesn't mean they will all die, and many of these older ones are still in the top 200\n\nJust simply means your long term HODLs outside of the top 10 have a 55-60% chance of not working out well for big gains. \n\nThat only makes sense.  \n\nAs of now we don't need 1000 Different Cryptos yet.  So you better believe many on top today won't be here another day. What we need privacy, it's our #1 concern really.\n\nWe need digital to protect against centralized fractional reserve banking that makes your $1 worth $0.01ea, and of course infinite scalability.\n\nWe will always need Altcoins.  BTC is great gold king, and will always be that way I believe.  However, those dam gas fees. Even eth. \n\nThe more adoption we get the more alts will be needed.",
