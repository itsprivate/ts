V3: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa15dc505498208741204327404f78b437ddedd6afc492e8fb40c62da199d270e\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa15dc505498208741204327404f78b437ddedd6afc492e8fb40c62da199d270e</a></p>\n\n<p>July 1st he posts the first youtube video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSEMJDwvXk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSEMJDwvXk</a> July 2nd he starts rugging liquidity while telling his community and followers to buy because it&#39;s going &quot;to the moon&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>By removing liquidity and not selling, he&#39;s effectively selling without &#39;selling&#39;. This way he doesn&#39;t have to tell the community that he sold while they all bought, he just has to hold his initial promise of keeping 1m of usdc liquidity</p>\n\n<p>He even holds all the liquidity in a 1% fee position so he can syphon out 1% of all the volume!</p>\n\n<p>In total he has his uni liquidity + 1m USDC extracted so far</p>\n\n<p>This is outright theft</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pro defi, community should call it out when we can, don&#39;t need law enforcement but this guy is cutting himself close:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>California citizen</li>\n<li>Doxxed</li>\n<li>Clearly a security</li>\n<li>All actions on chain</li>\n<li>Telling people do 1 thing as he does another</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, he literally rugs his own community (as a millionaire). <strong>There are</strong> legal implication for this.</p>\n\n<p>Research done by dcfgod.
