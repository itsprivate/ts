Sorry if I sound stupid, I&amp;#39;m just a bit new to all this stuff on crypto! I also don&amp;#39;t have that much to invest, but I always wondered what&amp;#39;s stopping millionaires from just leaving millions of dollars and getting a massive return on it by staking into a stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always sat in the back of my mind as to how come I don&amp;#39;t hear more about this. It just seems like a reasonable way to consistently gain a lot of money without really losing anything, unless somehow USDC and crypto overall just disappears the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Genuinely not a whale, it was something my friends and I were talking about for fun. It just made me wonder why more well off people just don&amp;#39;t stake into stablecoins, since they said they wanted to stake it into other coins that isn&amp;#39;t a stablecoin to stake for a higher APY.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
