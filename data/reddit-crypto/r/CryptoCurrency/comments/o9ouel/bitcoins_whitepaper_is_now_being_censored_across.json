Wright is nowhere in the community accepted as being the person behind Satoshi, but he abuses the legal system to claim this. He is also promoting his own (unsuccesful, its more than 200 times smaller than Bitcoin) shitcoin and tries to harm the classic Bitcoin as much as possible. <a href=\"https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/annual-national-training-seminar/2018/Emerging_Tech_Bitcoin_Crypto.pdf\">Download Bitcoins whitepaper here and tell people that he is not Satoshi if they claim he is.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
