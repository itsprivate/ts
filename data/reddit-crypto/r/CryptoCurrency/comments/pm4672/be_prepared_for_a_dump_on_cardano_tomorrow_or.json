The most likely scenario is that the news and launch smart contracts have already been priced in and will dump after the launch. This does not mean that ADA will not go up more in the future, but I do expect a dump for the next couple of days or even week followed by a slow rise to ATHs. Please be aware of this and DON&#39;T panic if the price drops heavily</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
