Which sounds like a good idea… save money for dips and a little more for any crazy market corrections. After all there isn’t much of a difference between buying Bitcoin at the bottom at 28k and waiting and catching 30k. But often times those people never buy because it never reaches the bottom advertised by TA experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is don’t get greedy waiting for dips. If you could have bought at 20k (which didn’t happen) or 28k you’d still be significantly up overall. That’s after a 30% market drop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows where the market is heading up/down. Which is why everyone recommends DCA you can’t time the market so spread out your entry points to decrease your odds of getting burnt or buying at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do don’t be one of those people that never buys because it doesn’t reach the bottom price that the media advertised.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
