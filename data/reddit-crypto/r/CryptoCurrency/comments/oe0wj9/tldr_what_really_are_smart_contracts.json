Smart contracts aren&#39;t just a fancy feature. Smart contracts are <strong>the completion of the Bitcoin idea</strong>. Without smart contracts, Bitcoin is incomplete, because it is a decentralized coin, surrounded by a centralized economy. It misses its own point.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wanna buy Bitcoin options, futures, bonds, longs, or any other financial instrument? You need a <strong>centralized</strong> exchange.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wanna bet some Bitcoin in a money match of Poker against some anon on the deep web? You need a <strong>centralized</strong> cassino.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wanna leave your Bitcoin for your family in the case you die? You need a <strong>centralized</strong> custodian. </p></li>\n<li><p>Wanna mint, sell and buy skins or NFTs using Bitcoin? You need a <strong>centralized</strong> game or app.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, replace Bitcoin by &quot;Ether&quot; and all the <strong>centralized</strong> companies above can be replaced by a suitable smart contract that performs the same operation without a third party. That&#39;s what smart contracts are. The whole point of creating a decentralized currency is to remove centralization, but that point is lost if everything you <em>do with</em> that currency requires a centralized company. If this isn&#39;t enough for you to get what I&#39;m implying, I don&#39;t know what else is.</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
