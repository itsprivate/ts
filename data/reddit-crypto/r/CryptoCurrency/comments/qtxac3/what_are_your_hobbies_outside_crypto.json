When you&#39;re not staring at the charts dreaming of your favorite coin mooning, what do you do with your free time? Do you go out, or do you stay in?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll go: my wife and I LOVE watching horror/scary movies. We&#39;ve pretty much exhausted the list on every streaming service... our favorite recent watch was The Descent. Something about having our hearts beat fast from the perceived danger just really gets us going... while sitting in the safety of our couch haha</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Loving all the responses! I can&#39;t reply to them all, but this gives me hope for the world :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
