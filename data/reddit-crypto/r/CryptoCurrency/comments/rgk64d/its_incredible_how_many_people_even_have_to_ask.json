And they have to ask whether such an insane spike in price is a glitch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this is truly baffling to me. This kinda shows that a lot of people have put money into an asset they obviously don&amp;#39;t understand to the slightest degree if they think every coin went up by a couple million percent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I truly hope you all (you know who) know what you&amp;#39;re doing and that crypto will be good for you eventually. But right now it&amp;#39;s looking kinda grim :/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for the award! Or was that just a glitch?ðŸ¤”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
