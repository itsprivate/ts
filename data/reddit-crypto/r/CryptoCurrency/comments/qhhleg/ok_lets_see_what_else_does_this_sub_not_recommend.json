Sub says this is centralized coin, not good, sell SOL, I sell. It pumps. Sub says buy QNT, I buy QNT, it dumps. Sub says buy ERG, I buy ERG, it dumps.</p>\n\n<p>I make some money on a dog named coin (got in on second day of it pumping 50-60% a day), make a small profit. Sub says sell it, I sell it. At 0.000025. It pumps 300% in a freakin&#39; week (from the day I sold), while everything else is dropping like crazy.</p>\n\n<p>So, let&#39;s make some money now. I&#39;m betting against this sub.</p>\n\n<p>Best two answers get $50 each. betting on the opposite outcome, of course.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I was initially joking but now I feel I can&#39;t let you down. $100 is only around 8% of the average monthly salary where I&#39;m from (on a sidenote, I live in a shithole). F it, let&#39;s do this.</p>\n\n<p>So, from the looks of it so far (sorting by Top), I should:</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>go long on ICP</strong> (looks like I have to sign up on FTX to leverage ICP so if anyone knows if this is a trusted (and only) exchange, let me know)</p>\n\n<p>- Buy Bitconnect (the closest thing is Bitconnect genesis which is not listed anywhere so I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t buy it)</p>\n\n<p>- give people moons (not actually a trading advice, but hey, I help a fellow <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> member when I can, so I tipped a few people, who wants to continue the tip train, feel free to find someone without moons and tip them)</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Buy Doge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Will give it some more time for our NA friends to join in on the fun. Will make an update (with proof) when I see the final tally</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
