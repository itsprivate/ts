By the time I wake up, there&#39;s already 10k comments. Now the daily is partially active regardless of time, but a large chunk of the activity is during the first few hours. Currently, all of Africa, the entirety of Europe, the whole of the Middle East and east Asia is asleep when the daily is posted.</p>\n\n<p>I propose posting the daily discussion 4 hours apart every day of the week. It would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sunday: GMT+4 \nMonday: GMT+8 \nTuesday: GMT+12 \nWednesday: GMT+16 \nThursday: GMT+20 \nFriday: GMT+0 \nSaturday: GMT+0 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way, There&#39;s at least 4 days a week where a person can comment early(assuming you&#39;re awake for 16 hours) and 5 days for Americans. The previous daily discussion only gets taken down once the new daily is posted. There will be a daily discussion up at all times.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/oybteq\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
