With that said I've decided to use a portion of my holdings to put a deposit down on a place for us to live on our own as we had been living with family. \n\nIt was a long shot, but we got approved and we're signing the lease tomorrow! \n\nA massive thanks to this community for all of the DD the memes and the knowledge that I wouldn't have had when I bought my first shitcoin in 2017; y'all are kings. \n\nThis obviously put a hold on my plans as I have a wedding and a home to pay for, but it's all for the best.
