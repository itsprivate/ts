It wasn’t until I had several thousand $ worth of crypto in it when I learned of its crummy business practices and the fact I don’t actually own the crypto. The problem I faced was that the only way to get it out was to liquidate it into USD, and transfer it to my bank, and rebuy the crypto on an exchange. I knew this process would take up to 6 business days. I was worried that in that time crypto would spike and I would lose potential gains. But I said screw it and did it anyway. Now I’m reinvested and have my ETH and BTC on Coinbase and I couldn’t be more relieved.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
