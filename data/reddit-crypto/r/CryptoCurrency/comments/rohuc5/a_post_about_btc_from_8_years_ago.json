I&amp;#39;m only 30 so I know while it is a risk, I still have a chance to recover if it crashes, and I have a full time job anyway. I just thought how the people around me are putting money into their houses, into children and expensive weddings, and they will never get a return on that. It just disappears. I also thought how most people will go their whole life and not take a risk and &amp;#39;go for it&amp;#39;... and when I&amp;#39;m older, I will not be able to things like this. I will be a lot more conservative. Now is the time for me to take a risk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I put a total of about $50,000 USD and bought in. I don&amp;#39;t know how long I&amp;#39;ll keep it in, but I&amp;#39;m thinking at least 5 to 10 years, maybe longer. I haven&amp;#39;t told anyone and I don&amp;#39;t plan to, but I feel good about it. Another thing I think about is that there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever released, and that is NOTHING when I stop and think about it. To me it seems like a great opportunity”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was his last post, hasn’t been active since that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving with a bang! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kpsi5/i_put_all_my_life_savings_into_bitcoins/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kpsi5/i_put_all_my_life_savings_into_bitcoins/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
