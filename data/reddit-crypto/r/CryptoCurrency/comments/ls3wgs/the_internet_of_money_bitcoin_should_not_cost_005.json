Vitalik Buterin is the creator of Ethereum - the most popular cryptocurrency making use of smart contracts and the second most popular cryptocurrency overall.  Vitalik's creation of Ethereum was one of the most significant turning points for the cryptosphere and opened the door to a whole wealth of new use cases.  It's popularity and use has grown ever since its release.  It seems however to be suffering an unfortunate side effect of that success.  Recently the high levels of activity on Ethereum have caused transaction fees to rocket to over $20 on average.  Many users are reporting being hit with fees several orders of magnitude higher.  Ethereum 2.0 is in the works to rectify this however no clear launch date has been set.  What are your thoughts, can Ethereum's popularity weather these high fees?  It still seems to be going from strength to strength despite them.  Or will projects increasingly move to lower cost alternatives.  If so will they move back to ETH when Ethereum 2.0 is launched?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr68blomolj61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=b546a98d00af478e587bfc9c6a93a7203a51403b",
