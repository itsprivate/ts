After Richard Heart himself decided to comment on the post telling me he deserved a Nobel Prize for his creation I decided to look up what I could find about this man hiding behind a fake name.*\n\n**Drama from the last post:**\n\nRichard Heart decided to share my post in the HEX Telegram group talking about 'No one will probably see the post because of the downvotes'. This resulted in dozens of HEX shillers sliding into my DM's saying disgusting things and massively downvoting my post. Guess what, **I can't be silenced. Even if it's just one person I can convince thats enough for me.** So, after clearing out the drama it got me last time I did this post, lets dive into Richard Heart.\n\n**Who is Richard Heart?**\n\nFrom a debate in 2017 between Roger Ver (Bitcoin Cash) and Richard Schueler it becomes clear that Richard used to be a hardcore Bitcoin believer and pointed out many Ethereum protocol flaws, ranging from poor coding to bad decisions in terms of programming language implementations (cryptoinsider). About a year and a half later Richard comes up with his coin, HEX. it is promoted to be a better bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain (oh, the irony). In the middle of the bearmarket and Richard being the largest participant in his own coin he convinces his following on Youtube to HODL the coin after mysterious dumps. You can find [here](https://i.redd.it/duecf980osf41.png) what is happening with the Ethereum when you purchase HEX.\n\n**Legal and questionable events from** **Richard J Schueler:**\n\n2002: Sued and won by [Peacefire.org](https://Peacefire.org) for violating Washingtons anti-spam laws, he was known at that time as the 'spam king' and made a lot of money off it - [source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/peacefire-org-beats-spammers-in-court/). The Methuselah Foundation, for which Heart volunteered at that time, was committed to extending the human lifespan and “making 90 the new 50”.\n\nQuestionable events in [Panama](https://web.archive.org/web/20171223110716/https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/): Several of Heart’s alleged aliases (James Hart, J. Richard, Richard Schueler) were named in connection with a Panamanian criminal network. Heart, called \"CharityLover' at that time supposed cohorts included robbers, blackmailers and corrupt lawyers and judges, according to posts stemming from the now defunct Panama-Guide website . Miguel Antonio Bernal (Panama lawyer) described the process by which American criminals flooded Panama to “rob, cheat and blackmail local businessmen using Panama’s weak legal system'' in the linked post under ''Panama\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“Nobody goes to jail in crypto” — Richard Schueler AKA Richard Heart -* [sauce](https://web.archive.org/web/20200216011920/https://jocularship.htmlpasta.com/)",
