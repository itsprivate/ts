I was thinking of buying a nice boat to take my kids around or maybe a small weekend house on Bali. No more worries about paying the rent next month!!! What do you guys think?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m really grateful for this reward mr.CZ of Binance! You are really too generous to us Binancians.  Who needs Coinbase when we have this.</p>\n\n<p>So long guys, I&#39;m off to cash out my  0.74841255 BUSD  voucher and I&#39;ll be on my way to financial freedom.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
