I started properly investing in 2021. \nOf course, I&#39;ve heard of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and a few others over the last few years. </p>\n\n<p>So recently, I found a piece of paper tucked away between books at home, with random words and it hit me, could this be a the seed phrases for a wallet? </p>\n\n<p>How could this be possible? I haven&#39;t bought into crypto before this year, or at least i dont remember buying in. My mind starts racing. Holy shit I&#39;d be rich as fuck if my younger self bought some BTC and forgot about it. I could get that PS5 upgrade, I could quit my job, I could eat fancier dollar store ramen.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, I decide then to calm myself down and started looking through my old phone for any wallet apps. I look through my PC for any wallet apps. Nothing. </p>\n\n<p>So i decided to do some googling and looked for any desktop wallet names I recognize. Only 2 prominent ones stood out, electrum &amp; exodus. Great, I&#39;ve heard of those well before i started investing in crypto. I start a search on my PC for any dat files. </p>\n\n<p>And there it was. A wallet.dat file hidden away in an archived electrum folder. Thank fuck i dont delete old files. </p>\n\n<p>I start sweating even more. </p>\n\n<p>I enter the seed phrases and lo it accepts it. I&#39;m brought to the balances page and it shows that my portfolio is worth is mind blowing $0. </p>\n\n<p>Turns out I&#39;d heard of crypto long ago and created a wallet to buy. And ended up not getting any. Younger me will be kicking myself right now if he could.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;ll be sticking to my PS4, I&#39;ll be keeping my job, and I&#39;ll continue eating regular instant noodles. </p>\n\n<p>So i guess this is a good reminder. Save your seed phrases somewhere safe, if you forget about it, you might have some life changing money! Or not...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
