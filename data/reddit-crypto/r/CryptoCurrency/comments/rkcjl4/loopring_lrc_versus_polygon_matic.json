Originally called the Matic Network, the Polygon Network allows developers to create and deploy their own blockchains that are compatible with the Ethereum blockchain with a single click, as well as enables other Ethereum-based projects to transfer data and tokens between one another using the MATIC sidechain. Think of it as a smaller blockchain that runs in parallel with the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loopring info: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loopring is a software running on Ethereum that aims to incentivize a global network of users to operate a platform that enables the creation of new types of crypto asset exchanges.  One of an emerging number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Loopring uses multiple cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC cryptocurrency, to together provide for this platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
