It will also be a fiat on/off-ramp.\nThe bridge will also serve as a fiat on/off ramp, providing additional functionality for DeFi users. It will absorb YLDY in an ERC-20 wrapper which can then be transferred to Ethereum where it can be deployed in a number of ways.\n\n“Our recent IDO with Trustswap really demonstrates that there is untapped demand for ETH holders to port tokens out of the Ethereum ecosystem and open up new opportunities in the broader DeFi sector,” Sebastian Quinn, cofounder of Yieldly, said. “In addition, the vast majority of people from the IDO — around 80 per cent — have staked their Yieldly on our platform, showing it’s not just being held to sell later, but to be used on the platform.”\n\nSource: https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/06/176710-yieldly-bridges-ties-algorand-to-ethereum-polkadot-and-binance/",
