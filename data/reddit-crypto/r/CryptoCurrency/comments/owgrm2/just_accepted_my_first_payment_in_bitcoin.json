They opened up their wallet, scanned the address from QR Code and pushed the transaction. I didn&#39;t want them to scam me, so I decided not to give them the coffee until the transaction shows up in my wallet. The next block was mined just 2 minutes later (SO LUCKY!!). Unfortunately the transaction wasn&#39;t included in this block, after waiting for 9 minutes, another block was mined, this time it included the transaction. But I wasn&#39;t sure if this block was legitimate, so I decided to wait for 3 confirmations, we waited 32 minutes, but eventually the transaction was confirmed. This went really fast, they paid only $20 for a transaction confirmed in 43 minutes. I finally handed them over the cup of coffee, it was still warmer than the room temperature. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the future of payments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
