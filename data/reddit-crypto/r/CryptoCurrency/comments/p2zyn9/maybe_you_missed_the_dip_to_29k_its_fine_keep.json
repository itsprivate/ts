If you truly belive these latter statements as I do, then keep accumulating BTC. Like my first statement pointed out, BTC is still down roughly 20k or 30% from the ATH. When BTC hits 6 figures, you&#39;re not going to care if you purchased it at 45k when you could have gotten in at 35k.  </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Even after the recent spike from 29k to 45k, keep accumulating BTC.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To all you commenting on this post, enjoy 1 upvote from me and don&#39;t spend it all in 1 place.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
