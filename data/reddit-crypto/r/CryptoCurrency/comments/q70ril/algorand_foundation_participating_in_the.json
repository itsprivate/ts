Who does this 50 million Algo belong to and how/who did they acquire it from?</p>\n\n<p>I sent a transaction of 0.001 algo to this account yesterday with an attached message which links to my reddit post yesterday and will do the same for this post so it will be immortalized on the Algo blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Some users have pointed out that this may be an Algorand Inc account which is different than the Algorand Foundation. Even if that is the case, I still believe this warrants a detailed explanation and transparency is required showing where these two supposedly separate entities are collaborating and for what ends.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
