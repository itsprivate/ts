I skipped buying BTC in 2014 when it was like $800 AUD because the wallet was too hard to figure out. I tied to day trade XRP by selling at 34c and buying back at 32c... the day it pumped to 90c. I bought the XVG hype before the pornhub announcement and finally put all my cash into a project which has done nothing but earned me $30k through dumb luck in timing my buys and sells.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to get sensible and invest in ALGO. We love ALGO right!! The ups and downs of owning a shit coin with that bankroll was too stressful, so I wanted something safe. </p>\n\n<p>22,000 ALGO later, my investment swelled to $60k and I cashed out a nice chunk for a house deposit. At the same time, I&#39;ve been watching the meteoric rise of SHIB and DOGE thinking &quot;if only!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So, 3 weeks ago I threw caution to the wind and put $18,000 into a meme coin, selected purely based on the community. I&#39;m up 628% and loving every minute.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not EXPECTING a SHIB like run, but a man can dream right?</p>\n\n<p>Wish me luck!! YOLO</p>\n\n<p>EDIT**\nYes I have cashed out. I initially dropped $6k over 4 years from 2017 to 2021. I have redeemed $40k approx with some cash set aside for tax and money towards a house deposit. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT2**\nFor those asking what it is, my post history will start you off.</p>\n\n<p>Not recommended for all, but its meme season! High risk, high reward. If you can afford to lose it, take the plunge. I have, and so far so good!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
