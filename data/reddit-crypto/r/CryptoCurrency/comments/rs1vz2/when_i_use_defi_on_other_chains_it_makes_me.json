I love it, it makes staking/LP awesome. I put my money to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, yesterday I tried to claim an NFT on ETH but the gas fee was almost as high as the lowest ask price for it on OS, so it wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s hundreds of Ethereum competitors out there and I use a few them. They actually make DeFi enjoyable for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ethereum does the opposite for me as I have to worry about losing tons of my precious ETH every time I want to use it. And you can completely forget about small transactions on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inb4 jUsT uSe laYer 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
