Their debit card rewards are better than literally any credit card reward program that exists, by a huge margin. CdC’s marketing is unparalleled. They likely have the backing of some serious funds considering the hundreds of millions they are spending on advertising. They appear to be completely rock solid, and on track to quickly eclipse Binance. I’m not yet invested in CRO and am still considering it at the moment, as it seems like CRO is the safest bet in all of crypto. I wouldn’t even mind buying $40,000 of it where it’s at now, using the CdC debit card as my daily driver, earn ridiculous cash back and staking rewards, and the price of CRO stay stagnant. I can’t say that about a single other coin in cryptocurrency. Every other crypto is purely about price appreciation potential. CRO’s rewards are so attractive on their own that price appreciation is almost a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please give me bearish reasons not to invest in CRO. I’m genuinely looking for a reason not to invest as I rearrange my crypto portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
