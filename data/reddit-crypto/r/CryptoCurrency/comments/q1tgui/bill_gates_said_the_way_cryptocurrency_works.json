Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.</p>\n\n<p>Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.</p>\n\n<p>To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.</p>\n\n<p>When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there&#39;s no incentive for them to end it.</p>\n\n<p>Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
