  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On morning of December 6, I logged into my Metamask wallet and saw that all my ETH was transferred out to an unknown wallet. My Metamask wallet is on a computer that I use only for crypto transactions, and my seed phrase is not stored anywhere digitally. I immediately checked etherscan to see what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wallet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x69ac7d9d794cbbd9632e8d917a180462885c390d\"&gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0x69ac7d9d794cbbd9632e8d917a180462885c390d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scammer&amp;#39;s wallet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x829e1d3b535e08960dae4aa9c06e2b13659dfe21\"&gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0x829e1d3b535e08960dae4aa9c06e2b13659dfe21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon confirming my ETH was stolen, I knew what went wrong. The night before, I was playing a crypto game called Town Star. The game allows for scripts to automate some of the actions in the game. I searched around and came across this YouTube channel that promoted a link to such a script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSc6fSgFbBc\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSc6fSgFbBc&lt;/a&gt; (now deactivated by YouTube)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the script, and in a lapse of judgement, I ran it without doing enough due diligence or have my spider senses go off. It immediately triggered my anti-virus and the file was quarantined and removed. I had a quick thought to reformat my computer right then, but it was late, and I went to sleep. Once I found out my ETH was stolen the next day, I scoured the internet to figure out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;File local police report (report approved)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Submit IC3.gov internet crime report&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep close tab on scammer&amp;#39;s wallet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn about how to notify exchanges once the stolen ETH moves&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a mining payout that was scheduled to payout that same day. I sat in front of my computer all day to move the last bit out before the scammer could do so. A day after, I was contacted by a Secret Service agent who had seen my IC3.gov report. Here&amp;#39;s our correspondence below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/floU7FZ\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/floU7FZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for a response back. Safe to say I went through all the emotions of fear, anger, shame, denial, grief, and acceptance. My wife and son gave me a lot of comfort in the past 2 weeks. I felt like I had failed them. My family is absolutely devastated by this incident as this was a big investment for us to mine the ETH. But I&amp;#39;m grateful to know that we have the strength to carry on even if the money never comes back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know now the dangers of having a hot wallet. Previously when I started mining, I went for the quick and cheapest solution. As my mining continued, I neglected to understand how to secure my assets and didn&amp;#39;t take the necessary actions to do that. And while I&amp;#39;ve come to terms that the ETH will 99.9% never come back, I stumbled across &lt;a href=\"/u/anonymizeme\"&gt;u/anonymizeme&lt;/a&gt; post recently, and it gave me some hope. Our family is praying for a Christmas miracle. Appreciate any guidance and support. Merry Christmas everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
