You follow these crypto youtubers every word, you fall for the clickbait titles and blame them when they shilled altcoin doesn't work out on your favor. Stop acting like children. These videos are not law, they're all opinion but you're acting like if you don't invest in the shilled altcoin you'll lose out on gains. You're greedy as fuck. When the bear market hits, I can't wait to see where the witchhunt goes. I'm so sick of people on this sub not talking personal responsibility. Bitboy, Ivan and others are not the problem. You're just greedy as fuck without doing research and you deserve it. \n\nThis sub has turned into a witch hunting angry children looking for someone to blame.",
