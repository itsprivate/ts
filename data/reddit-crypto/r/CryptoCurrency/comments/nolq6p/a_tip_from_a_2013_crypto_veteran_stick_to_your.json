When you make an exit plan, and you stick to, you will be rewarded.

While I could afford them, I wouldn't sacrifice my freedoms to be a slave of the FIAT regime and a slave to my possessions.\nI have interests in art and I have hobbies that I have as much time for as I want and basically unlimited resources to make them happen.  I can get my friends and loved ones gifts and help them out with cash when they need it. When I do have a partner I can spend as much time with them as I want and there is no money constraints as far as travel or entertainments goes.  I wouldn't say I am in the shadows, I'm more trying to stay off the radar. Crypto helps me do all of that. So yea there are things that I can't do, but there is so much more that I can.",
