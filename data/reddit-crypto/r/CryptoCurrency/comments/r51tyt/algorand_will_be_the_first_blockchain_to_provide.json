With stateproofs, Algorand will be the first blockchain to provide a post-quantum security solution. On the roadmap are post-quantum secure catchup (integrating state proofs in to the catch-up process), zk-SNARK proofs (efficient and cheap verification of state proofs) and light clients (tools to help entities use state proofs).
