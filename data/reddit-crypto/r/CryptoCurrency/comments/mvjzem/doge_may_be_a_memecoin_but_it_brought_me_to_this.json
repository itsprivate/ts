It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. \n\nLuckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. \n\nSo I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other \"cheap\" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. \n\nI'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.  I also want to thank this community for being insightful, helpful and welcoming to crypto newbies.",
