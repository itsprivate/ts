I had several accounts because I was degenerate back then, and obviously still tarded today.\n\nI did it because of bonuses, and free airdrops. Also Walton coin was new and I had to drop my pants for it because everything new that got listed on binance had moon potential.   \n\nYou know it, if it was newly listed on Binance , just like mini versions of coinbase rumors of XRP being listed, that crypto got instant credibility.   \"It got listed on binance!!!!...they don't list garbage!\".     That's because everyone here was borderline schizo with no experience trading anything in their life whatsoever.   Including all veterans like myself .  They are all tarded.  They just have experience.\n\nBack to what I was saying.   BNB came out and obviously nobody would imagine that shit being 300+.      Everyone knows anything less than $10 was not transferable or tradable. Was $10 min.    So everyone was left with dust. \n\nI decided to sign onto all these accounts . And between the 2 old accounts I abandoned I'm sitting on over 15 Binance tokens.  Along with an additional  $100s in dust on BTC and other things.\n\nI don't know what the FK I was thinking.  A few months back I was short on money and didn't think once about my dust.    Now I'm finding out my thousands of moons are actually worth about $0.10 ea???\n\nI can't tell you how relieved I am that Crypto is saving me and wife's ass this year.  We lost half our income because we are both SB owners.      \n\nThank you everyone for supporting me and my shitposts over the years.  I had nothing to do.  I just enjoy expressing my thoughts and experiences here.\n\nAnd an even BIGGER 🤗 TO the mods/admins here for making moons possible.   I plan to F**K myself with these moons and help some people out.   My wife's aunt and uncle are 88 years old and struggling hard.  They need only a thousand to keep them a float.   My neighbor lady's electric chair needs repair and she's been fighting with insurance.   \n\nTIME TO PAy it forward!!",
