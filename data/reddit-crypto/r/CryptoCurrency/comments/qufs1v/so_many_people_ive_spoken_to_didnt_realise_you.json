Much of the time this prompts them to ask how to begin investing (many never follow through, but some do).</p>\n\n<p>Just wondering what your experiences have been when it comes to the average person&#39;s knowledge of this. If you do find yourself in a conversation with a sceptic, it might be worth explaining that it doesn&#39;t take thousands to break into BTC investment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
