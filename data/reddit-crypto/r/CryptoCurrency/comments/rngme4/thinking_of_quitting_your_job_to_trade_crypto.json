Don&amp;#39;t leave your stable jobs, you may see successful traders out there but it takes dedication and a little luck to be a full time trader. Or at the very least test your strategy first, put it in a trial during both a bull and a bear market. Yes, you might be earning something around 10% or more everyday by what you are currently doing, but what if bear market hits and instead of earning you are losing value day by day, and you got no regular source of income to support your daily needs, are you gonna sell your crypto?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really want to change careers then at least stock up savings of at least 6-12 months of your spendings so you won&amp;#39;t need to worry about tomorrow if all else fails. I have friends who actually quit trading and became successfully, but I think it&amp;#39;s as rare as people dropping out of harvard and ending up as a ceo of multi billion company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day it&amp;#39;s your life, your decisions, I suggest your rub one out before making any life changing decisions, post nut clarity is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the January-April I was swimming in gains and my father asked me if I&amp;#39;m gonna quit my job to trade crypto. I&amp;#39;m like nahh, then May came. Sometimes it pays off being a scaredy cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
