So here we are, let’s do the top 10 most loved coins on <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Moons - Anything that’s free and has value will always be at the top. Redditors farm this token more than they work at their actual jobs.<br/></li>\n<li>ETH - Ethereum has always been a crowd favorite here, but it’s taken a seat to Moon’s hot streak.<br/></li>\n<li>ADA - With the recent news and pumps, ADA finds itself in the top three. If you want to argue this ranking, be prepared for downvotes to be ADA on your karma.<br/>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bitcoin - Has always been at the top, but lately it’s getting a bit boring. Bitcoin is like the old guy at pickleball, he may not look good but he hits his spots every time.<br/></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>ALGO - Tokenomics suck on this gem but this sub don’t care. Algo has been a favorite for years.<br/></li>\n<li>VET - Vet has been a staple in many a portfolio. And it’s actually being used in real world applications.<br/></li>\n<li>Tezos - Mentioned often as a go to for holding and staking. Tezos has been a hit for fellow crypto traders.<br/></li>\n<li>Polygon - Anything that helps Ethereum is an autoMATIC interest for all on this forum.<br/></li>\n<li>Solana - After a huge pump, redditors love this token because when you receive money, you give love.<br/></li>\n<li>ERG - The fastest riser, it’s market cap is 122nd but people are jumping on board like silver carp in a disturbed river.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let me know if I missed out on any. Hope this helped newbs know what this sub pumps.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Due to popular demand, moons move up to numero uno. And ethereum and ADA swap.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
