For a safer option obviously BTC and ETH, and higher risk pick 2 alts, which if your only putting in $1000 higher risk will be more appealing. If you hold 5 or 10 coins then a coin mooning you will see a far smaller reward. Obviously if you hold only 2 they could not moon at all, but risk vs reward it’s simply not worth diversifying with small amounts. \n\nNow let’s talk bigger folios. We can split this up into different categories. Your main coins (BTC and ETH (maybe even ada), your alts, and your moonshots. BTC and ETH are your safe bets (long term bullish), but remember this is crypto and compared to stocks or saving accounts, relatively risk is high. This should be the majority of your folio. I would advise around 60% but depends what your working with, the more money increase this %. Next your alts, this is the fun bit. Do your research and find coins that you believe in and put the rest in a couple alts, around 5-7 i’d say. This can be weighted to coins you like more or evenly distributed. leave 1-5%. This is for your moonshots. Here is a good basic video on finding an alt coin gem \n\nhttps://youtu.be/GIfihSBT6Bc\n\njust remember this is fun money and don’t pay too close attention because low cap coins have massive price fluctuations. Don’t plan your life around a shit coin giving a million % returns.\n\nI would also recommend making a spreadsheet or just keeping track of you buy in points somewhere, and obviously have your exit plan written in stone and follow it.\n\nplease shout at me in the replies if i say anything you disagree with or have something to add",
