I want to make your life easier and at the same time share my findings with the community.</p>\n\n<p>So I won&#39;t give you speech about how you need to create a bullet proof strategy and to do a extensive DYOR...I want to give you an opportunity to choose a coin that I will dedicate my time to do a extensive DYOR and share it with all of you in a second DYOR session next week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So please pick up a coin!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The coin that receives the most likes in this post will be covered!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> I will pick the most liked comment/coin after this post reaches 24h - I will update and announce it on the top rated comment and here on this post using EDIT 2 update. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
