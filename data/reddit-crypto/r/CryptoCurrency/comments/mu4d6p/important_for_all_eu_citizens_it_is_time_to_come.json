EU citizens can now officially propose ideas and voice their opinions on regulations, including on cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\n#### What is the Conference on the Future of Europe?\n\nThe Conference on the Future of Europe is a unique and timely opportunity for European citizens to debate on Europe’s challenges and priorities.
