The $2 Million Dollar Algorand Trailblazer Bounty Program will seed two million dollars worth of Algo bounties and grants, distributed over the course of two years, via leading bounties platform Gitcoin. \n\nAs the newest layer 1 to be supported by Gitcoin, Algorand will provide opportunities for developers and non-developers to earn Algo by completing bounty tasks designated by the Algorand team and community. The technical complexity of the development bounties offered will be varied, to suit both seasoned developers, and budding web2 developers looking to cut their teeth on simpler contributions in the web3 space. In parallel, the Foundation marketing team has conceived a host of creative and community-building bounties to allow community members to contribute their talents and earn Algo rewards.\n\nThe partnership will also allow the vibrant Gitcoin community to discover the opportunities available within the Algorand ecosystem. Additionally, it allows the Algorand Ambassador program to scale in a way not possible before, to meet the demand of our growing community and their desire to participate and grow the network.\n\n“I’m excited to welcome Gitcoin and its membership into the Algorand ecosystem”, Sean Lee, CEO of the Algorand Foundation. “Our goal is for Algorand to become the development platform of choice for sustainable, decentralized blockchain applications and this trailblazer program will be a key tool in rewarding people who join us on that mission”.   \n\nGitcoin Founder, Kevin Owocki stated, “The team and I are excited to welcome Algorand to the Gitcoin ecosystem. Algorand is an exciting open source smart contract blockchain that offers developers a really powerful platform to build on”.\n\nSource: https://algorand.foundation/news/trailblazer-bounty",
