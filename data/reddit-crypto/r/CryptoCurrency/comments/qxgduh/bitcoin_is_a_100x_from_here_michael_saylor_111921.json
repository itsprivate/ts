He thinks communist countries like China will allow possession of  Bitcoin but not for trading or letting wealth leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>He also was incredibly anti-defi and staking. He says he thinks the new infrastructure bill puts a huge limit on that and it won&#39;t be sustainable. </p>\n\n<p>There was a lot in the interview and its worth watching or listening.
