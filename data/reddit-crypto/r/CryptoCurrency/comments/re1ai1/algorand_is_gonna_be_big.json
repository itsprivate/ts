But I would consider it still early and  massively underpriced when thinking how big this is could turn out to be. I am not gonna go into much technical details of Silvios creation. Just browse through their official website, their papers or detailed articles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But considering:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;its PPoS makes it fast (roughly 4sec finality) with tps planned to go from 1k to up to 46k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cheap (small fraction of a cent for a transaction)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;unforkable and secure (1000 validators are chosen at random to confirm blocks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;green (barely energy needed and carbon offsetting)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;already somewhat  decentralized, with actively working to increase it and also novel governance vote (for eg token distribution) with high rewards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a very slick and simple to use offical algo wallet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defi building up with yieldly, tinyman and algofi coming up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bahamas and El Salvador already using Algorand tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami and Mayor Suarez going big with Algo (Decipher Event), committed part of his salary to receive in Algo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Vitalik praising Algo and Silvio &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundings like 1,5 bill Hivemind fund committing to algo as first partner, Arrington Capital, Borderless capital announcing new 500mio fund and skybridge announcing to build with unblox 5 new market places&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;algo pushing to be a place for creators, institutions and financial inclusion it will be massive in a few years continuing to innovate with state proofs for bridging, working on vaults etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not investment advice, but I besides BTC and ETH there is nothing i feel so good about besides Algo. And I am glad to be early and looking forward to a growing community of Algonauts, growing attention in social media, growing ecosystem and more technical innovation to come! Ciao ragazzi!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
