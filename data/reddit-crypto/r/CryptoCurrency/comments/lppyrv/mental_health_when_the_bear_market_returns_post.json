This is just a small correction and is unlikely an indicator that a bear market is coming.\n\nThat said it is very clear that emotions are high in the market place right now. New users may not be used to these kind of movements, especially as BTC and the whole market has been in parabolic mode for an extended period of time.\n\nWhen the bear market does arrive however it will be as brutal as ever. BTC and the crypto market has always gone through a cycle and when the tide does turn 14% dips will seem like childs play. Be prepared for tokens dropping 50% or more in the space of hours and for this to happen week after week after week.\n\nWhen this part of the cycle comes around it inevitably has a massive effect on people's mental health and in previous bear markets we have seen crypto investors on the verge of suicide.\n\nThe most important thing I must stress right now is to only invest what you can afford to lose. If your portfolio dropped by 80% right now would it financially ruin you? \n\nIt is very important though to remember that the bear market doesn't last forever and long term crypto has been on an upward trend. A year long downward movement may feel like the end whilst it happens but the long term prospects are incredibly bullish.\n\nIf you do get trapped with your tokens in a bear market do not despair, you only lose money if you sell at a loss, instead use the lower prices to strengthen your positions and dollar cost average down ready for the next bull cycle. \n\nMoney is great but your mental health and well being is more important. Hopefully we won't see the bear market any time soon but it will come at some point so make sure you are prepared.",
