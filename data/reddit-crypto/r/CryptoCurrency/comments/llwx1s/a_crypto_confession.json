I used to think this sub was bashing dogecoin out of malice for the community, but I know this is no longer the case.\n\nOver the past two weeks I’ve learned about block chains and cryptography while simultaneously getting almost overwhelmed with the amount of coins and projects available to invest in. I have opened a couple new accounts in different places and even have my own wallet where I own my own coins!\n\nIn the end, I just want to say I appreciate you all.
