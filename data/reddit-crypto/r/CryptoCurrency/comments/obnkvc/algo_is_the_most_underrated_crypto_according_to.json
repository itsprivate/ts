I feel like some of it is correct and some of way it is just way off.</p>\n\n<p>Final ranking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ALGO - 104.5</li>\n<li>VET -  54</li>\n<li>IOTA - 53</li>\n<li>XMR -  41.5</li>\n<li>XTZ – 38</li>\n<li>LINK – 37.5</li>\n<li>XLM - 32</li>\n<li>ATOM - 31.5</li>\n<li>DOT – 24.5</li>\n<li>ETH – 17.5 </li>\n<li>ONE - 15.5</li>\n<li>BAT - 9</li>\n<li>AVAX - 7</li>\n<li>MATIC – 6 </li>\n<li>ZILIQA | THETA - 5.5</li>\n<li>HBAR – 5</li>\n<li>CRO | EGLD 4.5</li>\n<li>REN – 4</li>\n<li>LUNA | NEO – 3.5</li>\n<li>BTT | KSM 2.5</li>\n<li>MKR | 1.5</li>\n<li>TRX | SOL | BTC | LTC |  NANO  | CHZ - 1</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>From what I&#39;ve seen on this sub, ALGO &amp; VET seem to be in correct positions. I know you guys love NANO and its obviously way below than what it should be. I was surprised to see IOTA(#3) that high because I have not seen much of it on this sub. Also, I got a lot of SAFEMOON comments but all of them were on negative upvotes and its obviously not in the top 50 as well, so I don&#39;t know why they even bothered.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, what do you think is missing from this list?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
