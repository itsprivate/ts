Problem is that today average investor play safe, when in 2010 they risked a lot. They had no informations, no guides, yt videos or books. Almost no one heard about crypto. They invested in something that most probably could be a scam.</p>\n\n<p>People today want to be rich as early bitcoin investors, but one - they would sell their coins just after x2 x5 or x10. How many of us would wait for coin to do x1000 or x10000? Second - we are mostly investing in safe and already big projects that will never grow a lot.</p>\n\n<p>First crypto investors were nerds that spend time on niche forums. Most of society even most of internet community had no idea about Bitcoin back then. Even If they had most of them were &quot;too smart&quot; to put money in another scam. There were no difference between crypto or other scam advertisements to invest and multiply money. Even after reading whitepaper and Satoshi Nakamoto posts most of us including myself would think it is bullshit. I, like average internet users get few ads about becoming rich by investing, changing world,  getting new job or  horny women in your neighbourhood scams. It was just a luck for early investors crypto wasn&#39;t another scam. And even more luck they were in little minority that heard about it back then.</p>\n\n<p>Completly different situation than today. Now we have knowledge and experience. We can predict  what good project need to succeed. Today those that invested in crypto in 2010 would be called shitcoin investors or gamblers. They risked money on unknown thing. Like shitcoin investors today thay risked a lot. 99,99% of shitcoin investors will never be rich. 0,01% will be lucky to find early  good and solid project that will be in top 10 cryptos. Of course if they will not sell it after just x10 or x100 gains.</p>\n\n<p>To become rich on crypto you need to risk a lot. It is easy to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum or ADA now. It was terribly risky to put money in them when they were worth few cents per coins.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
