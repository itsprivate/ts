This is a huge discrepancy not seen in other top subreddits. I analysed this below:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5rb5az6d7oi71.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2f6fad6f74f86087e6e3613ff23700a93c9f5f\">Top 50 subreddits (by subscriber count) + 3 subreddits offering crypto rewards. Subreddits typically have a karma ranking similar to their posts per day ranking (a value of ~1) - or a higher karma ranking (value of &gt;1).</a></p>\n\n<p>The other 2 subreddits that offer crypto rewards (fortnitebr, ethtrader) are also low - but nowhere near as low as <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is either because (i) users are reluctant to reward a post (ii) users are spamming low-quality posts (thus raising the posts per day count) in an attempt to farm rewards. <strong>Or, in reality, a combination of both.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whatever the reason, we are now at an all-time low:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4qjxvo208oi71.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70d10bc2db7c4b276522b54afeb6aaf24dfc770\">https://preview.redd.it/4qjxvo208oi71.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70d10bc2db7c4b276522b54afeb6aaf24dfc770</a></p>\n\n<p>On Jan 1st 2021, we ranked #87 for posts per day and #121 for post karma. By May (BTC&#39;s $64k ATH), the gap had widened to #4 for posts per day and #345 for post karma.</p>\n\n<p>I was not able to find another subreddit with such a large gap at present.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, across all of Reddit - <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> is <strong>the</strong> sub where you have to either work the hardest or be the luckiest in order to earn karma.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
