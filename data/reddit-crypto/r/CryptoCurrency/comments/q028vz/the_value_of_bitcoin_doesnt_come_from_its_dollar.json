Or water has no value on a lifeless planet. Value comes and is derived by the external observer. What you may think is worthless may be considered priceless to another person/species/entity.</p>\n\n<p>However, our species has evolved through times and assigned &quot;Perceived&quot; value to commodities and other forms of entities.</p>\n\n<p>So, now you must be asking why is this relevant to Bitcoin?</p>\n\n<p>Well it is the heart and soul of it&#39;s value. Bitcoin derives it&#39;s value from it&#39;s perception by the people. If many people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it &quot;becomes&quot; valuable.</p>\n\n<p>If your conviction for a future of decentralized money is high, then I salute you for making the Bitcoin network stronger.</p>\n\n<p>The fiat valuation of an emerging decentralized asset class is a false indicator of it&#39;s long term value and potential. So, be inquisitive about the Bitcoin network itself. How it&#39;s being run, what upgrades are on the way and what other use cases can it serve. This will massively reduce your fear and you can avoid panic selling.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t just look at the dollar valuation and jump to a conclusion. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Bitcoin derives value from the ever increasing number of people using it, the dollar valuation is just noise.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
