Well, Bitcoin hit its ATH in November 2013 exactly 12 months after the 2012 halving. So the ATH that came after the 2016 halving took about 5 months longer to reach than the ATH that came after the 2012 halving, so one theory is that each cycle from halving to ATH becomes longer.

But I am interested in the having cycle and thought I&#39;d share roughly where we currently are in this cycle compared to the previous ones, in case some of you out there find it interesting too.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
