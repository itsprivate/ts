Im not rich, but every time the market crashed, I bought more. It&#39;s a gamblers mentality... buy the dip and surely you will reap a quick return. Ignore what the parrots here say, it&#39;s not a good feeling when you buy something and it instantly dumps 10%. It doesn&#39;t make you a savvy investor &quot;being greedy when others are fearful&quot;, it&#39;s stressful feeling like you just keep fucking up over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward, my coin took off more than most earlier this year. I had several days gaining 5-10k at a time. 100k profit was just a matter of time. Why would anyone cash out in that kind of market?? I&#39;d go to bed expecting to wake up to 10 - 20k profit, and it happened more than once. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward again, flash crash.... and then a slow death.. my 80-90k was now 20k. Its not a good feeling. The fomo makes it incredibly difficult to hit the sell button. What if I sell and it goes 2x overnight??</p>\n\n<p>Final fast forward, this time I had a plan and stuck to it. Recovered to a certain threshold and sold $20k of my stack. It wasn&#39;t easy. All I was thinking was how much it would suck if it boomed tomorrow. Since selling, the market has dumped and my coin is down 10%, and I couldn&#39;t feel better about it.</p>\n\n<p>So at the end of this rambling, what&#39;s the point? In short, it&#39;s incredibly taxing mentally and emotionally when you have a large sum of money and try to milk every last cent of it. Moreover, most of the people here posting advice don&#39;t have anywhere near these amounts... so be careful who&#39;s advice you heed.</p>\n\n<p>My advice as someone who started with little, made a lot, lost a lot, and was fortunate enough to get a second go at it: take profits. Fuck you money is the dream, but its rare and it isn&#39;t worth the mental anguish. It&#39;s good to take a win now and then, even if it&#39;s not a tattslotto sized one.</p>\n\n<p>Happy trading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
