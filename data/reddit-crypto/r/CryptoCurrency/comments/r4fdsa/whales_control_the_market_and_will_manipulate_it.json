Whales are playing with the market and will continue to do so and take money off from retail, specially when you buy at the top and panic sell</p>\n\n<p>Other way to lose larges amount of money to whales is leveraging. A lot of shorts got blasted in the last 2 hours</p>\n\n<p>Just check Whale Alert twitter, there are millions and billions of dollar moving from just a few wallets.</p>\n\n<p>Even if everyone in this sub chipped in with 10 USD$, it wouldn&#39;t even come close to whales&#39; power. See this transactions just a few hours ago: &quot; 129,921,132 USDT (129,921,132 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to BINANCE &quot;. That&#39;s over 30 USD for each one here! And that&#39;s just one Whale</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: That&#39;s it boys and girls, you&#39;re a mere shrimp or algae in this crypto ocean, and the only real tool you have at your disposal is playing long term and not panic buy/sell, all the rest is playing with your luck and chances are you are going to get crushed by the whales</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
