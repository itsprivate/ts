Using crypto profits to take care of your mental health and well-being. Doing this will make you a better person for yourself, your family, and everyone you meet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since so many all-time highs have been reached lately, and a lot of our portfolios are in green, it is important to recognize that we are in a bull market at this point. <strong>It won&#39;t last forever</strong>, and it may not even last till the end of the year, so it is an interesting exercise to think about where all this is going.</p>\n\n<p>Putting this post together is about how to step back from crypto psychologically. There isn&#39;t the best moment to do so, but <strong>exiting with profits could be the most important step of your life</strong>. Speaking from my own experience, by no means do I intend to give financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve been in this sub for a long time now, you can feel the greed and euphoria of every single market rise. The topic of taking your profits and DCA out has been discussed a lot recently. However, <strong>we don&#39;t tackle enough the subject of what we should do next</strong> when the profits aren&#39;t on paper but in our bank accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Because the crypto market can go up and down in an instant, when you&#39;re in the green, it is important to appreciate that you reach your goals on time. We all know the HODL mantra, and having a lot of crypto in your portfolio is still a smart move, but you should also take advantage of bull markets to do good in the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you really going to look at the charts every day until you die?</strong> Cryptocurrencies should not become a source of dopamine for you. The world is a beautiful place, and you no doubt have a place in it. Remember that crypto is not our ultimate goal, and if we haven&#39;t learned by now, crypto won&#39;t make us happy. <strong>If you look at your life after you&#39;ve made a lot of money, it&#39;s easy to see that you&#39;re still the same person.</strong> If you&#39;re happy, you&#39;re happy; if you&#39;re unhappy, you&#39;re unhappy. If you&#39;re only in it for the money, likely, you won&#39;t find any meaning or fulfillment.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what you want in life, and do not focus on &quot;getting rich fast&quot;, <strong>focus on your deepest desires</strong>. Use your profit as a tool to improve your life, by traveling, buying a new house, starting a business, paying off debt, or just enjoying life. The list of things that will bring genuine happiness is endless. Having never been happy in my life, I always assumed the reason was lack of money, but I realized that good profits could solve my money problems, but they definitely don&#39;t solve all my problems.</p>\n\n<p>To be genuinely happy, I had to take responsibility for my mental health. I used some of my profits to focus on it and started feeling exponentially better. To be genuinely happy used to seem impossible to me, but boy, I have never been so wrong in my life! I am now happier than ever, and it feels incredible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Self-improvement is the most effective way to make the world a better place.</strong> You don&#39;t have to be a narcissistic asshole, all you need to do is practice self-care and care for the people around you. You should never forget that the profits from selling parts of your crypto portfolio may help you live the life you really want.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
