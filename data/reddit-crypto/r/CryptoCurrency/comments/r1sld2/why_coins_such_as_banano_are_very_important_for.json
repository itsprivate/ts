I first met cryptocurrencies through a post on the front page of Reddit a few months ago. It was a Banano giveaway and I got 1 Banano. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the Banano community I was able to learn about wallets, Dag technology, make test transactions and finally about this subreddit. </p>\n\n<p>Most members in the Banano community have a tip culture in which they tip people for fun contributions. They have fun events such as poetry contest, drawing contest and other cool stuff. </p>\n\n<p>But the most striking stuff is that, contrary to some places, they are proud of members selling and taking profits. They try to promote a wholesome culture and if you have friends trying to learn crypto but don&#39;t want to put forward capital, you can really send them there. </p>\n\n<p>They use the Folding@home as a way to distribute Banano and there are multiple faucets which provide more than decent payouts. </p>\n\n<p>I think, wholesome spaces in Crypto are very important and I&#39;m glad to have found them because thanks to them I am now part of this subreddit! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to them I got 130$ in my portfolio (which I have since sold for BTC) and I have multiple NFTs with small value (between 2 and 30$) </p>\n\n<p>Do you have projects such as this one which are very beginners friendly and are distributed in a fun and wholesome manner? </p>\n\n<p>I think Moons are also a good way to get people in Crypto but this sub, due to its very large community, is more about serious info/discussions, than memes and having fun while learning.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
