While there’s merit to this strategy, and intuitively it just … make sense, you may very well be better off dollar cost averaging your buys, ignoring the market volatility entirely.\n\nBefore we take a look, let’s explain what Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is. Explained simply, DCA is simply an investing strategy where we have a set amount of money we want to invest, and we divide it up to be invested over regular intervals. For example, if we have $100 to invest, and we want to invest it over one month, we can split the $100 into 4, and invest $25 every week. DCA helps lessen the impact of volatility, as you average out the highs and lows of the market (as crypto is especially volatile). You may buy high one day, and lower on another, and since it’s notoriously hard to time the market (aka impossible), over time your purchases will average out.\n\nNow, isn’t it better to just wait until the market takes a big dip, and then buy it while it’s on sale? It’s tempting to take this route, as no one wants to buy high and sell low, but even if you time it extremely well, it may not be the best strategy. Let’s take a look at why.\n\nFor the sake of these two examples, we'll be looking at the past 3 months, where things started to really get exciting.\n\nHere's the chart of Bitcoin for the past 3 months:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bitcoin Price: November 18, 2020 - February 17, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/7wumh5kdm6i61.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9d9aeee9b3e7bf7b44722837b7ec4c90894139)\n\n# Scenario 1:  DCA Strategy\n\nIt’s November 18 (3 months ago), and you have $30,000 you want to invest into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is sitting at around $17,000. Since we've decided to DCA, we’ll be purchasing every week on Wednesday, and over the course of the 3 months we’ll be making 14 purchases.\n\nSo, every Wednesday, regardless of what the price is, you go to your exchange, and purchase $2142.85 ($30,000/14) worth of Bitcoin.\n\nLet’s take a look at how much Bitcoin you’d have today.\n\nPurchase 1: November 18\n\nPrice: $17,929\n\nPurchase 2: November 25\n\nPrice: $18,701\n\nPurchase 3: December 2\n\nPrice: $18,991\n\nPurchase 4: December 9\n\nPrice: $18,467\n\nPurchase 5: December 16\n\nPrice: $21,666\n\nPurchase 6: December 23\n\nPrice: $23,172\n\nPurchase 7: December 30\n\nPrice: $28,689\n\nPurchase 8: January 6\n\nPrice: $37,085\n\nPurchase 9: January 13\n\nPrice: $37,519\n\nPurchase 10: January 20\n\nPrice: $34,696\n\nPurchase 11: January 27\n\nPrice: $31,001\n\nPurchase 12: February 3\n\nPrice: $37,992\n\nPurchase 13: February 10\n\nPrice: $44,586\n\nPurchase 14: February 17\n\nPrice: $52,129\n\nTotal Bitcoin Obtained:\n\n2142.85/17929 + 2142.85/18701 + 2142.85/18991 + 2142.85/18467 + 2142.85/21666 + 2142.85/23172 + 2142.85/28689 + 2142.85/37085 + 2142.85/37519 + 2142.85/34696 + 2142.85/31001 + 2142.85/37992 + 2142.85/44586 + 2142.85/52129\n\n= 1.12 Bitcoins\n\nYou end up with: **1.12 Bitcoins**, which would be worth **\\~$58,000** at the time of this post.\n\n# Scenario 2:  Buy The Dip Strategy\n\nIt’s November 18 (3 months ago), and you have $30,000 you want to invest into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is sitting at around $17,000. Things are looking up, and Bitcoin has been making some upward movement, so you don't want to buy just yet. Why not wait until things take a dive, and then scoop them up on the cheap? So you wait. Surely things are going to dip, right? And we wait some more ...\n\n[Bitcoin on Sale!!](https://preview.redd.it/ncspnzdkm6i61.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=578c61614e4753c3020790242b8b9922a9549070)\n\nFINALLY - It's Tuesday, January 12th, and Bitcoin's finally on sale. It tanked from $41,000 to $33,000, and using our superpower of seeing the future, we scoop up $15,000 worth of Bitcoin at the bottom of this dip.\n\nBitcoin Obtained:\n\n15000/33000 = 0.4545 Bitcoin\n\nGreat. Let's wait for the next great sale, and get the rest of our Bitcoin then. This time, we don't have to wait as long, as Bitcoin climbs back to $38,000, then steadily dips back down to $31,000. Once again, we use our superpower and see that this is the bottom, so we spend the rest of our money, $15,000.\n\nBitcoin Obtained:\n\n15000/31000 = 0.4838 Bitcoin\n\nIn total, we end up with 0.4838 + 0.4838 = 0.9383 Bitcoin\n\nYou end up with: **0.9383 Bitcoin**, which would be worth **\\~$49,000** at the time of this post.\n\n# Comparison:\n\nUsing our DCA strategy, we end up with **1.12 Bitcoins,** or **$58,000.**\n\nUsing our Buy the Dip strategy, we end up with **0.9383 Bitcoin,** or $**49,000**.\n\nNote: this is basically the best case scenario where you bought basically the exact low of the dip. In reality, you probably would have bought somewhere above the bottom of the dip, netting you even less Bitcoin in the end.\n\nWe missed out on at least $9,000 by trying to time the market, and buying the dip.\n\nEven if we twist the example more in our favor, and go all in with our $30,000 at the lowest dip when Bitcoin hit $31,000, we would have ended up with less than 1 Bitcoin using the \"Buy the Dip\" strategy.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe past 3 months have been unusual, even for the already volatile crypto markets. This post is not meant to say buying the dip is never the right option (a legitimate strategy can be to combine both methods).  Rather, it's meant to highlight why it's not always a \"sale\", as you could have netted better returns simply by shutting off your brain, and buying at the same time every week. Often, being the smartest is doing the least.",
