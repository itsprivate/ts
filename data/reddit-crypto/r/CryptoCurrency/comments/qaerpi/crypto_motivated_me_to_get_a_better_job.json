It’s my hope that not only will this be a positive investment, but that it will continue to motivate me to make a better life for myself. </p>\n\n<p>This all may sound ridiculous but any improvement is good and I’ll take motivation where I can get it. </p>\n\n<p>A big thank you to this community for all the positivity and education. I view this subreddit as the absolute cornerstone of the crypto space for better or for worse, I love you guys and gals. </p>\n\n<p>Have a good day and I hope all your coins go to the moon.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow! Thank you all so much for all the kind words and awards. Reading all of this has given me even more motivation to do my best today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
