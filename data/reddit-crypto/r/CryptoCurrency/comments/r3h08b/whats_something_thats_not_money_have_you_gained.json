And boy am I glad that I know it. I&#39;m only 21 and this a lesson that I will carry until I die (hopefully not soon lol). I grew up in a poor family, in a third world country and my parents are Financially Illiterate. Hopefully, I could break the poverty cycle with my new lessons on crypto.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Financial Literacy from crypto taught me:</p>\n\n<p>How to do my research when investing in anything (very important), how to spot scams, how to be responsible with my money, ~~how to not pay taxes~~ jk, how to not let my emotions ruin my financial decisions, how to live below my means and save money, etc. And this Financial Literacy has given me a hope. A hope that maybe, I could break this cycle of poverty. I&#39;m still one broken condom away from financial ruin tho lmao.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Even if I get all the money in the world, If I&#39;m not Financially Literate, It don&#39;t matter bro.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Technically it&#39;s about money, but also not really money. What&#39;s something you got from crypto aside from the gains (if any lmao F)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
