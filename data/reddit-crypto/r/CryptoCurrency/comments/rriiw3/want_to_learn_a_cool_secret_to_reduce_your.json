  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you bought 1 COIN at $100. The price of COIN drops to $80. Omg, your upset you just lost 20% of your money. Friends/family all tease you, &amp;quot;smooth move, ex-lax, you just lost 20% of your money!&amp;quot; And then your GF rightfully leaves you cause you&amp;#39;re not the coinwinner anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then you realize, you just got an extra $100 saved up because you no longer have a GF which you always helped out by giving her money for her tutor fees (when she had those late Friday night study sessions with Kevin). It all clicks. BINGO!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you take that $100 and buy more COINs, you now have a total of 2.25 COINs which make your current portfolio balance $180. Since you invested $200, but only have $180 you&amp;#39;re still down $20....but what&amp;#39;s this! Wallah! $20 ÷ $200 = 10% loss. Holy shitcoin, Batman, you&amp;#39;re now only down 10%!! Your portfolio is magically going up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like me, you can go back and tell everyone you&amp;#39;re technically only down 10% and your portfolio is going up! You&amp;#39;re happy cause your exGF is talking to you again and comes running back to ask if you&amp;#39;ll help move her stuff into Kevin&amp;#39;s new apartment. So you agree, since you&amp;#39;re a nice guy, cause you know she&amp;#39;s smart by taking those valuable tutoring lessons from Kevin each night. Eventually when you make those gains, you can also help out and give her a little money for rent that she keeps asking so badly for and then shell have a great education and be your GF again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just keep doing this secret trick and you&amp;#39;ll never be down a scary 20%.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
