The woman on the phone then finally admitted, after some initial phrases, that the cancellation took place because I had received transfers from a crypto exchange (Kraken) in recent weeks and this was undesirable.</p>\n\n<p>Super. It&#39;s legal, but puts everyone under general suspicion who has something to do with crypto.</p>\n\n<p>But the best was yet to come. When I wanted to transfer the credit to an account at another institution after the phone call, the transfer was rejected with the note that it was blocked, I should contact customer service.</p>\n\n<p>So I called them again, this time with much more anger. Now a man on the phone, he told me that it was strange that transfers are blocked, since the cancellation actually only takes effect at the end of December. </p>\n\n<p>He can now only arrange a check, which will take a week. The best thing for me to do is to write a letter asking him to transfer the money to an external account.</p>\n\n<p>Fantastic. I get my account cancelled without warning. I make a fool of myself at the supermarket because my card is declined. And now I have to write a letter to an online bank asking them to pay out my balance.</p>\n\n<p>I am really stunned. comdirect is holding a five-digit amount hostage and refers me to writing a letter.</p>\n\n<p>If I didn&#39;t have other accounts, I would be pretty much screwed right now. At least I can pay my rent and buy something to eat.</p>\n\n<p>Next week, I will pass the whole thing on to a lawyer, consumer protection, BaFin (Germanys top financial watchdog) and maybe a newspaper.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
