People think of it as a cheap copy of ETH, which is ridiculous in itself, it&amp;#39;s also a sign that comforts me I&amp;#39;m still early to be on the train.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of 12/10/2021, Cardano has a market cap of $42 Billion USD. Good feet in Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then let&amp;#39;s look at other projects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solana&lt;/strong&gt;: arguably one of the most centralized coins in existence! So much so their systems even crashed cause of one of the validators failing to process. The team is also known for lying about their market cap to the officials. &lt;strong&gt;$53 Billion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tether:&lt;/strong&gt; The stable coin, that isn&amp;#39;t even stable. The team printed $1.5 Billion dollar worth of it out of thin air! After saying that &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;only %2.9&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; of their coin was backed by the USD &lt;strong&gt;$76 Billion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if Cardano fails in the long term, by proving you can be on the top without flashy hot new garbages, IMO &amp;quot;Cardano is &lt;strong&gt;DISGUSTINGLY&lt;/strong&gt; undervalued.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely. U|Tylanmon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you all! For sharing your thoughts about Cardano. I found some solid opinions against what I wrote, and it makes me so happy! I still think that ADA has a bright future, but I saw some huge problems within that I never did before thanks to this post. If you have other opinions, comment those down below, and i&amp;#39;ll try to read all of them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2.0: Holy fuck! Reddit congratulated me cause apparently, this post has been the most controversial post &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; over Reddit in the last hour! Though people seem to hate me after reading this post, I thank all of you for reading &amp;amp; sharing your own thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
