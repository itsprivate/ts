Would you really take advice from someone that has &lt;em&gt;[X] coin x1000???&lt;/em&gt; 🚀🚀🚀😱😱😱😱 in the title or thumbnail of his video?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end of year is closing in and a lot of shameless shill videos are being made. A friendly reminder to be very wary of these videos. These so called “crypto experts” are not trying to give advice. They are either getting paid to shill, help do a pump and dump, or simply make videos for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also.. it draws to my attention that there are a lot of technical analysis videos being made. Proper technical analysis takes a lot of study, experience and perhaps a degree in economics. 99% of the technical analysis video I have seen are 20-year-olds doing some weird woo-woo and random line drawing. The crypto market is irrational and to a certain extent… nobody really knows what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I listed some YouTubers that I personally never ever would take advice from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitboy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;K Crypto&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Joe Parys&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coinskid&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Crypto Banter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Chain of Blocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MMCrypto&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chart Champions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RUN GUYS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conor Kenny&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CryptoJack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Craig Percoco&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these channels are worse the other. And some actually are more nuanced than the other. But still…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just have a look at some of the titles:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRAZY 400x Altcoin Gains..
