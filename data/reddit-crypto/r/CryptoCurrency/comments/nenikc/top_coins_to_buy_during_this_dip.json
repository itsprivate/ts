Bitcoin: The top and trusted coin of all. If your risk tolerance is low or just want to have a backup coin incase all alts crash, *slaps hood* this is the bad boy for you. Long term hodl will give great returns.\n\n2. Ethereum: Fundamentally, the greatest coin of them all with a humongous ecosystem and proven blockchain. If Bitcoin was introduced after Ethereum, I'm certain that it wouldn't have been able to live up to the standards of this coin. Although it has come under scrutiny for its PoW and high txn fees, as soon as ETH 2.0 comes out all of this will be gone and it will literally fly.\n\n**Projects that have all been once called to be \"Ethereum killers\":**\n\n1. Polkadot: Currently in the phase of rolling out parachains, once completed we can see it moon (for reference, Kusama launched parachains last week and a saw a major price boost)\n\n2. Cosmos: Development on the chain has been quite active recently. In the process of launching a DEX. In the future can partner up with Binance.\n\n3. Cardano: Quite a lot in the news recently due to it being suggested as a better, more environmental friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Also has been very active.\n\n4. Elrond: Super active in the past few months. Has done several partnerships and has seen real world usage. In the process of launching a Dex and a launchpad.\n\n5. Solana: Super active this month. Has recently launched a hackathon. Has seen a TON of new projects being launched upon it.\n\nOther great picks:\n\n1. VeChain\n2. ChainLink\n3. UniSwap\n4. SushiSwap\n5. PancakeSwap",
