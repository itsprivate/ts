Well, as you can see nothing happened (just a little dip). That proves nobody in this sub knows what the fuck they are talking about. Shit I dont even know if after posting this the markets will crash or go to the Moon. Nobody here knows what will happen. Evergrande could go bankrupt and that could cause crypto to go to Mars. Evergrande could announce it&#39;s been able to pay all it&#39;s debt and crypto could crash to oblivion. Nobody knows what will happen, there&#39;s no way of predicting what will happen. Past performance of the markets shouldnt be used for making predictions and technical analysis is basically astrology with charts (specially on crypto). All the posts predicting crashes are FUD written by people that dont even know they are spreading FUD. Just remember that analysts have successfully predicted 11 out of the 2 economic crisis of the last 20 years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
