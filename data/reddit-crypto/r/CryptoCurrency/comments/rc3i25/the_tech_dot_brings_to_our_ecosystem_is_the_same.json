If you have questions - please ask and I&amp;#39;ll try to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, imagine the history of crypto as it relates to tech advancements in this space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, there was BTC. This represents mono-chain value transfers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, there was ETH. This advanced our ecosystem to mono-chain computation where the most basic computation is value transfer, but then loans etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then ETH became bloated and fees went up. Competitors appeared - also computation mono-chains, but lower fees and better technicals. First-mover network effects result in BTC and ETH maintaining their value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, our ecosystem is at the point where we have cross-chain value-transfer bridges a la &amp;quot;wrapped tokens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next? Cross-chain computation-transfers. This goes beyond just moving value between chains - its having one chain tell another chain to compute something that it&amp;#39;s more specialized at computing than the first chain and having both chains trust the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is Polkadot. It provides not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; cross-chain value transfer but allows for cross-chain &lt;em&gt;computation.&lt;/em&gt;  This is why it is important. It unlocks the next step in crypto which is analogous to the introduction of ETH into a pre-ETH ecosystem. It introduces computation to an area that currently only has value transfer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;p.s. parachains launch on DOT &lt;strong&gt;Dec 18&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
