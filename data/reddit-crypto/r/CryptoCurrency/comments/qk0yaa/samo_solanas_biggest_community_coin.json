Thanks for the support all üî•///</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re all aware of the dog coin hype at the moment, so I thought it was worth making y&#39;all aware of what&#39;s happening with Solana in this space.</p>\n\n<p>DOGE is to Bitcoin as\nSHIB is to Ethereum as\nSAMO is to Solana.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re bullish on SOL, and you missed the train on the first two, then this is a good way to get in early on the Solana ecosystem&#39;s biggest community coin, and #4 biggest meme coin in the entire crypto space (yet only $0.4bn market cap).</p>\n\n<p>The Dev Team&#39;s aspiration and the current vibe in the subreddit is community-focus and utility - not just a pump-and-dump meme &quot;moment&quot;. There&#39;s tons of stuff happening in the space: 1) 500M coin burn on a random day each month for the next 6 months, 2) SAMO NFTs to be released with buy-back and burn mechanism built in, 3) Metaverse projects coming soon, 4) A super motivated and efficient dev team who were heavily involved in Solana&#39;s recent Ignition Hackathon.</p>\n\n<p>The community&#39;s super friendly and welcoming at the moment, so post in the <a href=\"/r/SamoyedCoin\">r/SamoyedCoin</a> subreddit if you have any questions ‚ô•Ô∏è </p>\n\n<p>I strongly believe that (however you feel about meme/dog coins) the hype from SAMO could be a fun yet powerful advertisement for the Solana blockchain - which as we all know is the fastest blockchain existing right now. It was my first time actually using the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet (outside of CEXs) and I was blown away with how simple it is. If it can do this for me, who was already a SOL advocate, then it can definitely do this for millions more users.</p>\n\n<p>As the fastest and cheapest to transact dogcoin existing right now, this should be all the info you need to make the call. See you there üêæ</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SAMO&#39;s available on ORCA, Raydium, STEP and (as of a few hours ago) gate.io and (just now!) MEXC GLOBAL. You can also use Jupiter Aggregator to compare the best prices. I&#39;ve also just been informed by a commenter that you can use the Coin98 mobile app to transfer SOL to and get SAMO, if you don&#39;t want to deal with web browsers for your DEX swapping!</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
