This is absolutely nothing to worry about. If you are a newbie, you should look at this as a buying opportunity instead. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: It is crucial that you look at the bigger picture. Look at the trends, we had multiple of these corrections and they actually proved out to be a buying opportunity instead of a dip. The recent price action is absolutely nothing to worry about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
