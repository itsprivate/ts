What you are doing is having different cryptos lying around in different places, all of which is generating more coins every single day, and you don’t have to do a single thing. Think of it like having multiple bank accounts and each of them are earning you a 5-10% APY every year.

Locked simply means you have to leave your crypto in there for a fixed period of time, and will be unable to withdraw it out. Flexible is straightforward, you can take it out anytime you want to. I hope I included the main things to know before jumping into staking. If anyone reading this hasn’t looked into staking yet, I highly suggest it. It is the best form of passive income in my life right now, and I hope more people start having this stream of passive income as well!\n\nLike the saying in this subreddit goes: Give a man a steak and he'll eat for a day.
