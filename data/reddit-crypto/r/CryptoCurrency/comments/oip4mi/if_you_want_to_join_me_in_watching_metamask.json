But if  that&#39;s never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: </p>\n\n<p>I can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. \nHowever there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don’t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.</p>\n\n<p>SECOND EDIT</p>\n\n<p>I was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go….</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
