I&#39;ve prepared for this dip by saving some money to the side. My question for the community today is what are your favorite projects that you&#39;re looking into getting into today? I see some really nice discounts on crypto today and I&#39;m trying to get a community consensus on what we think is a good buy right now? My personal picks are Luna, Algo, maybe some ADA. Do we still think Dot is a good buy at current prices?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Ok, I&#39;ve made some moves. My picks were Algorand, Harmony One, Cardano &amp; Polkadot. </p>\n\n<p>Edit2: If I didn&#39;t already have a bag I&#39;d also pick up XTZ, LUNA, MATIC, CAKE, SOL, Ergo, Elrond.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for all the great suggestions, also thanks for being such a cool community. Much love people ❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
