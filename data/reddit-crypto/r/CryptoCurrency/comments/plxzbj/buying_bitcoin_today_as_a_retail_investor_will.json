Here&#39;s why:</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say that BTC doubles by year end and we&#39;re sitting at 100k (a theoretically possible, but very optimistic scenario).  Buying today means that you doubled your money at year end.  Congratulations.  Your $1000 buy is now $2000.  Your 10k buy is now 20k.</p>\n\n<p>In five years, assuming that you don&#39;t shit your pants in a bear market and sell your 0.0217 BTC, and assuming that BTC somehow makes it to the insane valuation of $1M, you now have 20k, or 200k, respectively.  But on no planet in the universe does a sub-100k buy of BTC at today&#39;s prices turn you into a millionaire, even in the most favorable circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>This is why many of us focus on other coins and tokens.  It&#39;s not because we don&#39;t believe that BTC is a great coin with fantastic growth possibilities.  It is.  But the opportunities for stratospheric percentage gains are gone.  Huge dollar value gains equal smaller percentage gains.</p>\n\n<p>Other coins may not overtake BTC in per coin price.  But they need much smaller gains to yield the same result for retail investors.  If Cardano goes to $5, that&#39;s the same as BTC going to 100k.  If ETH goes to $7000, that&#39;s the same as BTC going to 100k.  If Algo goes to $4... you get the point.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying that BTC won&#39;t go up substantially.  I&#39;m saying that tiny fish won&#39;t turn into whales with it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: math error.  5 year projection should be 20k and 200k, not 10k and 100k.  Thanks for pointing it out in the comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
