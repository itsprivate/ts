  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve seen this a few times a week, at least. I just saw a brand new redditor post here on <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a>.  They had no karma and their vault wasn’t set up. Essentially, the question was “What is cryptocurrency and which cryptocurrency should I buy? I’m 18”.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is post was auto-deleted. But before it was, it received a couple comments.  Some of them were solid.  Some of them…not so much.  “Moons”, “The one you did research on” and “0 karma and the man still here, lol” aren’t necessarily incorrect, but they aren’t helpful either. </p>\n\n<p>This person is 18.  The fact they want to invest - in anything - is amazing. Imagine if you were 18 years old again and you received some great advice that motivated you to start your journey? How life changing would that be? I’d love to be 18 again and have some money to invest in something like cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re going to comment on posts like these, let’s ditch the one word quips and the one liners. </p>\n\n<p>Tell them about the free <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EH6vE97qIP4\">Money and Blockchain</a> class at MIT taught by Gary Gensler (now US SEC chairman). Tell them about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies class by UC Berkeley. Or Smart Contracts by University of Buffalo and The state University of New York.  Or Introduction to Digital Currencies by University of Nicosia (UNIC).</p>\n\n<p>Direct them to CoinBureau <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fiw5rp3zoo0\">How to buy cryptocurrency step-by-step</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VYWc9dFqROI\">Explaining crypto to complete beginners</a> on YouTube, or 99 Bitcoin’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/41JCpzvnn_0\">What is Bitcoin?</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jxLkbJozKbY\">What is Ethereum</a> videos. Benjamin Cowen also has a good <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_P_lxTknRE4\">What is Ethereum?</a> video. </p>\n\n<p>Direct them to Satoshi’s white paper at <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\">Bitcoin.org</a>. Or whatever easy-to-understand factual resources you know.</p>\n\n<p>Explain what HODL, DYOR, and DCA is. It’s tedious for us, but likely brand new information for them.  Tell them about <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a> moons and encourage them to set up their vaults when they can.</p>\n\n<p>Helping the next generation of cryptocurrency investors now is essentially helping yourself in the future. This 18 year old will get a job and invest their hard earned money into various assets one day.  A positive initial experience here at <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a> will help grow the entire cryptocurrency industry, and your current and future cryptocurrency investments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
