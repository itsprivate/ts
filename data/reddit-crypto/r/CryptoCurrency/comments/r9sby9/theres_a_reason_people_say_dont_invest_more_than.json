You should realistically be able to look at your entire portfolio, and say that if it went all went tits up and dropped 99% overnight, you’d still be fine in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can come into this highly volatile market with an actual plan/strategy, you will be much better off 5-10 years down the line. There are many safe investment strategies, with DCA being the most popular amongst them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re not afraid of losing your crypto, you won’t be afraid of HODLing it. You won’t panic sell at a loss, you won’t convert to coins that are currently pumping. All in all, you’ll be in a better place if you’re not over-exposed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me, once you go balls deep into the rabbit hole, you’ll find yourself trying to catch the next Doge, the next SHIB, etc. &amp;amp; trust me, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
