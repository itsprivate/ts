I pay to take out my own cash, i pay an overdraft fee instead of declining the purchase, i pay fees if i make too many transactions on my own account, i pay fees if my balance goes below a certain point and i get an interest rate that is offensively, insultingly low. </p>\n\n<p>It costs too much to be poor in America. I&#39;m literally charged by my bank for being too broke and I&#39;m fucking sick of it. Thank you for the pleasure and privilege of using your legacy (read: predatory) cefi financial system but I&#39;m fucking out.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had these accounts since i was literally a child, memorized my bank account numbers before i even knew what a SSN was. And it took me 35 years until cryptocurrency opened my eyes and showed me how badly we&#39;re being taken advantage of under this system.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m moving on. My savings will be in stablecoins with generous APY because with crypto you do not need exorbitant amounts for your money to work for you. Normal people should have the same access to the same profit mechanisms that the wealthy have and i am of the perspective that crypto <strong>can potentially</strong> facilitate the greatest exchange of wealth this country has ever seen. So I&#39;m starting the process of migrating out of cefi as much as possible and assuming greater control over my own financial future. The bank is not looking out for us, that&#39;s for fucking certain, so we might as well start looking out for our own damn selves.</p>\n\n<p>Fuck your bank. Stop trickling our money upward and taking comfort in our financial serfdom, assuming anyone is looking out for our best interests. We have uniquely big opportunities in the labor market and the financial sector to change the landscape and move the balance more in our favor. If it hasn&#39;t been working for us then we can either force change or abandon the system, we can rug cefi and they know it and they are fucking terrified of crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
