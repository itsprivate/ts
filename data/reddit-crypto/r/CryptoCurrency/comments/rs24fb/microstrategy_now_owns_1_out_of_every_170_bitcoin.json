This kind of hypocritical behavior is why I&amp;#39;m finding it hard to reason against my friends who are in traditional finance. Really, the only thing getting outside of crypto-space are scams, government FUD and the ridiculous behavior on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want people to get why crypto is important and what the &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; is, but it looks like almost every participant is just working against it...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
