No, they took this as their last opportunity to rip her checking account for as many overdraft fees as they could while refusing to let us get the account closed. My mother was living month to month on a very small pension and disability checks. Her checking account was set to auto pay her monthly bills (mortgage, heating oil, water, electricity, internet / cable, ect.). When the income stopped, I went right to the bank and asked them to freeze the checking account and stop the bill auto-payments. The bank manager told me that they could not because I was not the executor of the estate. My aunt was the executor so she would have to contact the bank to get that taken care of (My aunt was the only person listed on the will because my mother’s will was the one that the Navy had her make before her first deployment.. which was years before I was born.) So, my aunt called the bank right away and asked for the checking account to be frozen and we would have the bills set to come in the mail to us. The bank manager said “of course” they would take care of that right away. Two weeks later.. they didn’t do anything at all and the account was in the red with over $600 of overdraft fees. That bank manager straight up lied to us saying that the account would be closed when my aunt asked. We went to the bank again to clear up their mistake and they told us that there was no mistake, and we need to settle the account right away. F\\*\\^\\* BANKS! I can’t wait until all banks are forgotten rubble of the past. I hope that our Cryptocurrency community grows and grows, and our freedom lights up the blockchains dooming those corrupt institutions into obscurity. I am going all in on Crypto and I cannot wait until the day comes when I won’t have to step foot in, drive past, or even look at another bank ever again.  And I will say it one more time. F\\^\\*\\~  BANKS!",
