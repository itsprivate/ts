It is the only internationally recognized currency where even minors have the same rights as adults and can not only make purchases, but also invest and contribute to the global economy.</p>\n\n<p>My country considers investing in other currencies as &quot;money laundering&quot;. So much so that they haven&#39;t even let paypal or gift cards in the country. The only way a teenager could contribute is by doing hard labor, which is common in a third world country.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto is a lifeline for those in Venezuela, Lebanon, Syria and even Yemen. You can donate to people instantly with zero fees with the click of a button using crypto. There are apps like WeNano where you don&#39;t need to pay anything, yet you play a role in helping. Crypto is the way I made my first buck online, and so did many others in a situation like me. </p>\n\n<p>People often look at crypto as something that is used to buy drugs or do illegal things, they overlook the best aspects of crypto, and how it&#39;s helping millions of people. If you hold crypto or promote it in any way, you are helping a lot of people in the present, and especially by selflessly promoting it, you are helping their future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
