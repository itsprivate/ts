Bitcoin has a trillion dollar market cap and is the 10th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call that being &amp;quot;early&amp;quot; anymore. Ethereum is #15. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn&amp;#39;t 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren&amp;#39;t going to make insane gains and that&amp;#39;s just the truth of it. There are 15,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 5. And the industry just started back then, now it&amp;#39;s been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I&amp;#39;d say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don&amp;#39;t make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
