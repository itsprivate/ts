You have no idea who is behind a profile, you could literally be receiving advice from a 15 year old. Also just because other people agree with what someone is saying does not mean they are right, if someone acts confident people will believe them. I have seen someone saying it’s best to store your seed phrase on your computer or online which is literally the worst thing to do, yet people were upvoting and praising this. Also to the new people, do whatever you feel comfortable doing do not delve into the unknown just because someone scared you into thinking you have to own a hardware wallet or else you’ll lose everything. It’s a learning experience, it’s best to start slow. Stay safe and smart out there guys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
