This has left many new investors very, very salty. Many people will have seen comments since from those burned from the last crash that have turned from crypto believers to crypto cynics.\n\nI fully admit... I can't predict the market, no one can.\n\nHowever, what I can say is the market appears to be turning over from all time highs, many prolific crypto vets are calling a bubble, people haved moved on from bitcoin as it's cooled to start speculating and investing in ALTs many legit, many crazy. Bitcoins market cap is dropping against ALTs. The gains to date have been crazy. And the subs in Reddit have ballooned.\n\nThese are all metrics evident in the last substantial market crash.\n\nWhat I would say is don't worry.. there will 3 times the negative news stories about the bust than the boom. Media and cynics will call the death of crypto.. the weak hands will be shaken out. \n\nAll those who bought at top and sold out at the bottom last time.. would have most likely be in substantial profit today if they hadn't sold.\n\nThis post might be conceived as being against ALTs.. which couldn't be further from truth.. diversification in a range of cryptos is always a good strategy.. but it's worth while DYOR and investing in those that you personally think have good merit, not jumping on board a hype train. \n\nJust over a year ago.. Bitcoin could be bought by true believers at as little as $4000. Crashes are sales.\n\nSimilar times will come.. that's why HODL and BUY THE DIP are trademarks the community.\n\nIf you're over leveraged and have money invested that you can't afford lose.. I would suggest now's a good a time as any  to rebalance.\n\nIf you've made some profit.. there's nothing wrong with taking some.\n\nCrypto moves to higher highs in bubble cycles.. long-term it's not going anywhere and will always outperform FIAT.\n\nThanks for reading, if this helps one person then job done.\n\nAll the best and happy cryptoing! üëç",
