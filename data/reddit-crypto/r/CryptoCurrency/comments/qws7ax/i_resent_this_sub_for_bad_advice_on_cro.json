At the time crypto.com and their CRO coin had a bit of a bad reputation but I did my own research and determined that the things people were concerned about were growing pains and that an exchange with the domain crypto.com had a very bright future.</p>\n\n<p>After getting my account approved I posted here asking for advice on if I should invest a substantial amount in CRO since I believed crypto.com was destined to become a major player like binance and that inevitably the CRO price would go up.</p>\n\n<p>My post was met with lots of fud and responses from people who had likely been burned or knew nothing about crypto.com and CRO. I should have gone with my gut and my own research however I was brand new to crypto and didn&#39;t trust myself.</p>\n\n<p>At this time CRO was about $0.06. Now CRO is $0.50+ and crypto.com has bought the naming rights to the arena where the Lakers play.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story is 90% of what&#39;s posted here is garbage that won&#39;t help you make good investing decisions. Go with your gut.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Wow. I knew this sub had some bad advice but I didn&#39;t realize how incredibly toxic it had become as well. Everyone was new at some point. There are tons of new people coming here everyday to try and learn more about crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
