Every crash and every bull run you’ll see advice and long write ups that are very good. But still none of it means dick. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve held millions of coins of different shit and like an idiot come on here and get convinced I’m the stupid one and should sell. Well yes I’m still the stupid one but so is everyone else. </p>\n\n<p>I sat down tonight and went through all my transactions from when I bought and sold and thought back why I sold. I’m approaching 300k of gains that I could’ve had if I just did one thing.</p>\n\n<p>Hodl</p>\n\n<p>So my advice for new comers and people still listening is don’t listen to anyone but yourself. DYOR and then throw it away because it doesn’t mean anything.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing is this sub is just filled with random thoughts from degenerate gambling assholes who don’t know wtf is going to happen. So treat it as a meme page basically. </p>\n\n<p>P.S. I love you all</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
