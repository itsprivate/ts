I tried reading whitepapers but to hell if I understand half of it (I mean I do, but there is to many phrases I do not know, and when I search for them I fall into a rabbit hole of new things and it&#39;s frankly too much). I tried watching youtube videos, but to me those fall under the category of shilling coins. Tried many sites to view pros and cons of cryptos but damn, I&#39;m out of my depth here. I guess after a year or two in this I&#39;ll get it like many of you guys do.</p>\n\n<p>So long story short, I came here where nearly 3 and a half million of us post daily and have invested in cryptos that have been having good reviews (but they have bad reviews here also, and that is what I like the most) and invested over a couple of months.</p>\n\n<p>Boom I&#39;m now 80% up from my calculated investments over time. So you can say Reddit did my research for me, thanks people!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: for all people asking my largest holding is ADA, second is VET, then ETH and ALGO.</p>\n\n<p>If mods want proof just shoot me a PM</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: This is not financial advice, as always DYOR</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
