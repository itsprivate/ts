Someone told me the comic book creator StoneToss is releasing NFTs and so I follow it closely because he is very popular among the people who share his views and extremely infamous among those who do not. There are several different large subs dedicated to altering his comics or just making fun of and attacking him.</p>\n\n<p>While his comics are offensive often, the apparently offensive thing that had his collections banned was supposedly confederate flags appearing in the NFTs which are randomly generated. </p>\n\n<p>This is crazy though... to see communities that pride themselves on being about decentralizing and allowing anyone to do transactions, not allowing an entire group because you dislike the creator or some of the content shouldn&#39;t be grounds for deplatforming.</p>\n\n<p>In my mind it takes away from the whole purpose of cryptocurrency at it&#39;s core. Marketplaces like Amazon will appear who are so large and backed by so many big dollar interests you need to be on them to stand a chance.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not advocating for or against the NFTs or the artist, my job is just to cover the news. And this is news because it shows that your ideas aren&#39;t safe on platforms who disagree with you, not even your actual content.</p>\n\n<p>What are everyone else&#39;s thoughts about the situation?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> It looks like Rarible caved and allowed them back on the marketplace as of this moment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
