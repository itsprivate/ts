Perhaps in more civilized countries robberies and murder for money is not as common but for the rest of us who may not come from places as nice this is a danger.\n\nWallets can be recreated with the 12 \"seed\" words that are used to recover wallets even when lost. If word goes around that you have a lot of crypto the wrong people might hear about it and decide to pay you a visit. You may not know what those words are, or as someone suggest, offer a secondary wallet up instead of the primary one but that's not fool proof. They might decide to actually kill you after giving the secondary or be smart enough to know there should be more and continue asking you for another wallet. They might receive your primary and straight up assume it's not enough and has to be the secondary.\n\nYes, this is not a problem now for you and your $4,000 in crypto but 4 years from now you will be the guy who talked about bitcoin when it was 20 times (if being generous) less. They won't know if you sold or not and bad actors will assume you've continued adding funds through out that time.\n\nBe smart and be safe. Advise family and friends if asked but crypto currencies are big enough now for even your grandmother to have asked you about them.\n\nPlease keep safe, thank you.",
