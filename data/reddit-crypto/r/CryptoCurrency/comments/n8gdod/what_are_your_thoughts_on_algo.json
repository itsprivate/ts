I'm just a historically traditional investor who is really becoming more interested in *blockchain* than crypto*currency*. I intend to thoroughly research any negative points made as part of my DD which I will post in the future.\n\nGood Morning Everyone:\n\nI'm looking for a discussion on the Algorand blockchain. \n\nMy initial research has me feeling that this could be a solid long-term play. But, I'm more of an investor than a day trader or bag chaser and am unsure if my long time horizon mentality fits into the crypto space. \n\nNonetheless, I intend to make regular weekly purchases of ALGO in the hopes that in the future ( 5 - 10 years?) Algorand will overwhelmingly be the blockchain of choice for developers.\n\nWhy do I feel this way?\n\nThe entire premise of the Algorand blockchain is solving the \"Trilemma\" of blockchain technology. The trilemma states that you can pick 2 of 3 options [scalability, security, decentralization] but not all 3. The term was coined by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSpeaking of founders? Algorand was founded by MIT Computer Scientist Silvio Micali. I believe that Mr. Micali and those around him have the highest probability of solving the Trilemma problem. If that issue is solved (if the blockchain can be shown to be decentralized, scalable, and still secure), then I believe that developers will prefer this blockchain.\n\nAnd finally (and perhaps in my opinion, most interestingly):\n\nAlgorand is the first Pure Proof of Stake blockchain - which may solve the Trilemma. I'll quote them here:\n\n\"Algorand proposes an alternative that can satisfy all three requirements. We call it Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS), and it might be one of the most significant breakthrough inventions in the blockchain industry.\"\n\nhttps://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/proof-of-stake-vs-pure-proof-of-stake-consensus\n\n\"The PPoS protocol is also built on Byzantine consensus, and each token holder’s influence depends on its stake in the system. The trick is that the protocol selects users randomly, irrespective of their stake.\"\n\n\"Staking\" in this context refers to the amount of ALGO token that you are holding. The \"validators\" of transactions are still chosen randomly, regardless of their stake. However, bad actors are weeded out, since anyone holding a large stake is less likely to approve a nefarious transaction as it would devalue their own stake.\n\nAnyway, anyone have ALGO thoughts? My crypto strategy until this point had been \"ignore all of the crazy people and just keep buying BTC.\" In my opinion, BTC is the best cryptocurrency at acting like money. But I believe that the Algorand blockchain will dominate in the coming years.",
