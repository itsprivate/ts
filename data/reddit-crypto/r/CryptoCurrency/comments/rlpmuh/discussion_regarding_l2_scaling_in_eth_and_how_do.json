I will not mention any by name, since I had a post earlier mentioning some by name, and it was removed, however, I am still very interested in having an orderly discussion about how L2 scaling will grow ETH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now there is a fairly steep barrier to entry, as we all know, especially for those who are not technologically involved, this barrier is price of gas fees, and understanding of how to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are now existing solutions that will allow users to use L2 platforms for free, without paying the gas fee to create a L1 wallet, which tells me that there is plans for the space to grow in the near-term (1-3 years) at a very fast rate compared to which the rate it&amp;#39;s grown in the past.  Along with more people being curious about crypto, and the attention that it&amp;#39;s been getting in the MSM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you guys here think that L2 will be the catalyst required to have ETH grow into much more than it already is today, and what solutions in the space are you most excited for, and, as an enthusiast, how can I get involved in growing the L2 space, since we all know that paying a $1 gas fee is 100x better than paying a $100 gas fee, literally, and finally, what cryptos should I look into if I really want to prepare my wallet for this adoption, and invest into projects in the space?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look forward to reading your responses, and discussing in the comments!  Thanks guys, -obmj&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
