Private, secure, ultra low fees, untraceable and truly decentralized.</p>\n\n<p>Decentralization:\nMonero is ASIC resistant and CPU mineable, that means it would be extremely hard for someone to attempt to centralize it. It is also profitable to mine it off of your CPU.</p>\n\n<p>Privacy:\nThere is a reason that XMR (Monero) is known as the king of privacy coins. It is untraceable. The IRS/DHS still have large multi million dollar bounties that no one is able to claim (and if they are able to, the devs can always change the code and their back to square one). The hardest part is going to be to finding out if/when they crack it. People are recognizing their privacy as more and more important, I personally am extremely bullish on XMR. </p>\n\n<p>Low fees:\nThis speaks for itself, the block times are two min long. As well as the fact that the average  transaction is measured in the cents instead of dollars. The average transaction is 12 cents.</p>\n\n<p>There is the commonly used argument that Monero is only used by criminals, while some criminals do utilize XMR, the vast majority of them are done in Fiat such as the US dollar, since Monero does leave some sort of a trial (mostly on exchanges and in your wallet), while has is not. That is why cash will always be king for criminals.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
