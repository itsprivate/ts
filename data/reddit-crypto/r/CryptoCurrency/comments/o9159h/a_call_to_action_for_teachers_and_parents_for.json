I could have done so much with my life if I was given the basic run down before going into the adult world.</p>\n\n<p>So, I created a down-to earth, brass tax financial literacy course. Finding housing, learning real-world costs of living, college vs. working, being a good roommate, taxes, credit scores, retirement, social security, finding a job, stocks and investing with simulator investing app,  living alternatives, etc...and one three hour day is set aside for crypto alone--including all pros/cons, videos of ELi5 type-stuff,  and I&#39;m having them download a crypto investment simulation app to be used for the two weeks of class. Even talking to them about bull runs and bear markets, DCA, all the stuff--and the importance of taking time to learn and how long it takes to get a grasp on basic fundamentals of understanding what this whole thing is about. </p>\n\n<p>I see how forlorned these kids are about their futures. School districts everywhere need to require financial literacy courses---and hopefully, cryptocurrency and blockchain. </p>\n\n<p>If you are a teacher, especially a social studies teacher, here&#39;s your call to action! Create a financial literacy course curriculum for next summer or next year and propose it to your school. Schools have received all kinds of funds for summer school because of the Covid and students need credits. Also, many districts are getting on board regarding these classes in the yearly curriculum.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/teaching-financial-education-in-schools-finally-catches-on.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/teaching-financial-education-in-schools-finally-catches-on.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If you are a parent of a high school student, call your kid&#39;s high school or go to a school board meeting and demand financial literacy in school.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
