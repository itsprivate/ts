Safemoon&#39;s CTO Hank left the team earlier this month and there are rumours of more team members leaving, causing safemoon holders to panic sell.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some VERY interesting things happening with one of the top safemoon wallets. Someone picked up some suspicious activity in a certain wallet called &quot;Safemoon Protocol: Deployer&quot;, and it turns out the wallet belongs to &quot;SafeMoon Dev&quot;. If you don&#39;t know who it is, Safemoon Dev is the &quot;mysterious&quot; creator of Safemoon but not much was known about him besides him hiring Hank (The CTO who now left) and some other safemooners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what&#39;s with the wallet and the suspicious activity?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Huge amounts of tokens were getting transfered within short intervals. On september 17th for example, a trillion tokens were transferred, and on september 9 and 14th, about half a trillion tokens were transferred as well. There were other transactions with both buys and sells in large summs. Keep in mind this wallet contains millions of dollars worth of tokens.</p>\n\n<p>In the past this wallet was used to fund different aspects such as marketing, operations, development, events etc so it never had to pay the 10% tax all other holders have to pay. Devs been selling off, dumping the price as well as taking a big dump on people investing into this slow rug pull. Hopefully this serves as a lesson to current and future investors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Safemooners can&#39;t handle the truth it seems. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/nECxTS7\">https://imgur.com/a/nECxTS7</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
