I worry a lot about investments, except this one.  I go to sleep every night just fine, even when I am down so much.\n\nStop freaking out about tomorrow or next week, when to buy, when to sell...long run it will be ok.  Will it 100x your money?  Probably not. It is what it is, a place to put your stash and wait it out.  The fact everyone is talking about bitcoin in the media is positive, it generates volume, and more big time players that will not let it die.\n\nRelax, kick your feet up and be thankful you have money at all to invest. Stop worrying about day to day, be nice, and enjoy that the pandemic is coming to an end and we can soon all enjoy being free again.  It’s too good of a time to waste it being angry and stressed out.  <3 to all of you, happy to be sharing the journey together.",
