But don&#39;t let that detract from the fact that it elevates you to the status of someone who wired $1,000 to an anonymous person on the internet in exchange for some magical beans.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d be stupid not to have money invested in cryptocurrency these days, but keep in mind that it&#39;s almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. In a bull market, everyone is a brilliant investor. People who post here pretending to be seasoned investing gurus are more often than not people who got lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, pretending that everyone who invests in cryptocurrency will become a millionaire.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time in history that a generation of young people has gotten rich by jumping on a wild speculation train. People had the same attitudes at the height of the dotcom bubble. &quot;Twenty-five percent returns in a year?&quot; Those are scrub figures. Anything less than 100% is not acceptable!&quot; We all know how that ride ended, and this one will as well. This ride will come to an end, whether it ends in a major bust or becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street. Take advantage of the high returns while you can.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, If you have the money to do so you can manage your risk by diversifying. Yes, the goal of diversification is to have a completely uncorrelated asset. Because all cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another, diversifying requires diversifying in a completely different asset class. Investing in another coin is not considered diversification; it is equivalent to investing in McDonald&#39;s and KFC and calling it diversification.</p>\n\n<p>As always, thank you for your time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
