My problem was that it became very oversaturated and there wasn’t too many genuine coins that enabled me to make profit.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just beginners luck or if all their calls are that good. All the coins I have bought from there have been safe which is important to me and it’s clear they do their research. My only issue is that I’m from Australia and often miss their calls.</p>\n\n<p>So this leads to my question – where can I find more reliable information about new coins? It’s important to me that they are honest and do their research into safe projects so I can have confidence investing.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
