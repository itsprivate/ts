You don&#39;t check the charts every five seconds to look if your coin pumped.. You don&#39;t post about your fear.. You don&#39;t ask about predictions.. You don&#39;t shill stupid coins hoping you will pump the price.. </p>\n\n<p>Not everyone invests an equal amount of money. Not everyone has the same goals as you. Not everyone&#39;s good or bad is good or bad for you too. Each advice echoes to a different kind of situation.</p>\n\n<p>So, the advice you get in here is most likely by short term investors! Capture this.. And think if that&#39;s what you need!
