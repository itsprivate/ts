He breaks it down easily and doesnt get panicked or excited by the market (Still waiting to hear what price he would be getting out of bed for). In his latest video he celebrated 500,000 subscribers all without having Ad Sense. He actually went and showed his dashboard. Thats a straight up good guy greg move.
