But then, I see a lot of coins, who even their white paper looks like taking 30 minutes to create and still raise money. There is no way people dont know that a shitty project, but they still put money in. This is baffling to me at first, and then I realize people don&#39;t give a shit if it&#39;s a shit coin.
