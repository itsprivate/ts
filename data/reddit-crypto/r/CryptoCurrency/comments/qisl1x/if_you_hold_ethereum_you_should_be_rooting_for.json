In a nutshell, every time Ethereum processes a transaction, a part of the fee is burned.</p>\n\n<p>This drastically reduces the supply of Ethereum(and will even further reduce it once Eth 2.0 comes out).</p>\n\n<p>So, every SHIB traded back and forth means more Ethereum burned. Actually, according to <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">ultrasound.money</a>, SHIB is one of the top burners of Ethereum in the last month.</p>\n\n<p>Once Ethereum becomes a Proof of Stake chain(2.0), Ether issuance will plummet to about half a percent per year. That combined with the burn mechanism will make Ether a deflationary asset.</p>\n\n<p>The more Ether that&#39;s burned today, the less there will be come time for the merge to Proof of Stake.</p>\n\n<p>Supply and demand.</p>\n\n<p>SHIB traders, do your thing.
