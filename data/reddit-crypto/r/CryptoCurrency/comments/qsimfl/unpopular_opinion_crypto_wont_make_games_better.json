Do you really want crypto to become a part of everyday gaming? To fall on the lap of EA or Activision? Aren&#39;t pre-orders and paid DLCs bad enough?</p>\n\n<p>And to top it all off, do you really want to turn gaming into a second job? That&#39;s the part I really can&#39;t understand. Gaming is my escape from work, the one thing I can do to relax, and people want it to be a paid thing? </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s next, crypto rewards for eating, for breathing, for going out on a walk, all dependent on how well you do it? Do you really want to gamify your life, your free time and the experiences that are meant to be your escape from trying to make money? Is that really the world you want?</p>\n\n<p>This is very exaggerated and dramatic probably, but this is how I feel. I really don&#39;t think Crypto will make games better in any way, I think people just want to believe that because it&#39;ll make them money.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
