I bought crypto before this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a guy that talks to me with disgust gets to tell me what I can do and what I can't do with *my money*. \n\nHaving a bank decide what I can do and do not with the money that I WORK for - not them, not anyone; my time, my money - it's just insane. This is sick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan't wait for banks to become ruin and history.
