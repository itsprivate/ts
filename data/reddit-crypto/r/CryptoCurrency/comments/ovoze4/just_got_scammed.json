I then proceeded to deposit ETH from to the Ronin wallet I generated from the app thinking Ronin wallet should have both mobile app and browser extension. Idiot right? I know. </p>\n\n<p>Woke up to see all my axies gone. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/Ww4srpR\">http://imgur.com/gallery/Ww4srpR</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/8lBYMD2\">http://imgur.com/gallery/8lBYMD2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/OwANQsN\">http://imgur.com/gallery/OwANQsN</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/Ve9clNi\">http://imgur.com/gallery/Ve9clNi</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/sxTbyNa\">http://imgur.com/gallery/sxTbyNa</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/xfNjbik\">http://imgur.com/gallery/xfNjbik</a></p>\n\n<p>Literally created a wallet for them with the seed phrase, put my funds in there and went to sleep. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d never think you&#39;d fall victims for such scams until you do. I admit I&#39;m the idiot who did not double check every step while handling my own assets. But before all of you pile on with all the why&#39;s, do&#39;s and don&#39;t, or about the amount of warnings around, I&#39;m fully aware of all the scams there are out there. What&#39;s done is done, all the questions won&#39;t bring my assets back. What im here to do is spread awareness even though you think this is an obvious scam. Me too, I&#39;m not oblivious to it. </p>\n\n<p>It was just a moment of carelessness. It&#39;s still up on the android app store, and yes I know everything about the app is a red flag, but understand that I was doing it on both mobile desktop while working at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that my day job involves dealing with scams is even more embarrassing to admit. This proves that even  the knowledgeable CAN and WILL fall victims to such scams with just a few missteps. It&#39;s not just the gullible and or ignorant that fall victim. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Or maybe I&#39;m just so goddamn naive, stupid, lazy and a worthless human being who&#39;s bad at his job and should be fired? Yeah take it how you will and have a nice day. </p>\n\n<p>Your opinions and comments are much appreciated. And btw thanks for all the upvotes and awards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
