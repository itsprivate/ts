My thinking is, I&#39;ll never be able to invest enough in bitcoin or even eth now to ever be financially comfortable from it. I&#39;m not talking &quot;fuck you&quot; money, just comfortable. My strategy was to invest heavy in alt coins such as ada, vet, enj, matic, ckb and a couple others. I figured if I acquired enough like 1000s of each I&#39;d have more returns in 5-7 years. I figured even if I dumped my whole savings and retirement in bitcoin I&#39;d maybe get 1.5. 75k worth. Let&#39;s say bitcoin hits that 100k mark I&#39;d only double my money (which is great) but wouldn&#39;t I have better odds and greater returns with the bigger alt coins? Or am I being a dunce? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts and strategies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
