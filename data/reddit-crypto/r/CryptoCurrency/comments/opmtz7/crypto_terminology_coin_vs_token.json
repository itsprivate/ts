These blockchains may differ in their size, rules, miners, performance, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Token</strong>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Tokens refer to cryptocurrencies that don’t have a blockchain network of their own. Instead, these cryptocurrencies are built on another blockchain.  Examples of tokens would be: USD Coin (USDC), DAI, UMA, and Basic Attention Token (BAT)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to post this to share the knowledge and website and hope some people find it useful!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
