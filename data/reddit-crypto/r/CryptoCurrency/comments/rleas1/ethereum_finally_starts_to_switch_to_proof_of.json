When the update goes completely live, the miners will become literally obsolete - no compromises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we have two warriants:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Miners resigned!!! Everybody sells graphic cards to public! Gamers happy &lt;del&gt;as only Bitcoin farms remain!&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Miners switch to other remaining PoW coin, and surrounding press is making it go crazy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While lots of everyday people would like the first to happen, I think that the latter is way way more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what coin it could be? &lt;del&gt;Will miners switch to Bitcoin and concrete it even more? Or&lt;/del&gt; will they go for Ergo, that is slowly setting down and is going to make payments less while reducing the possibility of mega-mines? Then we have Litecoin, Monero and after it... a huge list of lesser known coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your take on this situation? I&amp;#39;d personally love to see Ergo skyrocket, but it&amp;#39;s only my early investor&amp;#39;s hopium, &lt;del&gt;realistically I think that everybody will just switch to Bitcoin.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: Someone just told me the difference between Bitcoin and GPU mining, so I edited the post :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
