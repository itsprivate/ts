This includes brave opinions like “crypto good.” The other types of posts that will be allowed are factual statements like “unpopular opinion: bitcoin and vitalik buterin are not the same thing” and popular predictions like “unpopular opinion: bitcoin might go up in price at some point in its existence.”</p>\n\n<p>Again, no opinions allowed. Especially unpopular ones. That’s it for now, enjoy the new sub! You have yourself to thank for this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
