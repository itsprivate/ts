Don't forget your password! After you activate the vault, you can start participating in the community and you will get your MOONs according to your upvotes at the end of the month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I get those MOONs to my wallet?: Even though it uses ETH as the base, you still need to convert it before getting it to your wallet. DO NOT directly withdraw to your ETH wallet or else you'll lose your MOONs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan't we just upvote each other and increase our MOONs?: Yep. That's the beauty, upvotes at the ready!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this has been somewhat helpful, everyone join in the party and the MOON train!\n\nStay healthy!",
