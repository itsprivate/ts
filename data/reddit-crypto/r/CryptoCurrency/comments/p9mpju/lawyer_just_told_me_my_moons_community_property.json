I got the typical worksheet that the lawyer&#39;s office gives out and I filled it out and turned it in. It asked about bank accounts, land pretty much everything that you could imagine. But nothing about crypto. So, I didn&#39;t fill anything out. Of course, my ex knows all about my crypto. So, after we turned in the inventory my lawyer called and said that I left something out. I told him it wasn&#39;t on the sheet. He actually, didn&#39;t know anything about crypto at all. So, I filled it in this time, including everything except my moons (this is a back up account). My lawyer just called me and said, my ex is asking about something called Moons. He tells me as long as they were accumulated before the divorce she gets half. Of course, I&#39;m going to counter with asking for half of her international Santa collection. But we&#39;ll see where that gets me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
