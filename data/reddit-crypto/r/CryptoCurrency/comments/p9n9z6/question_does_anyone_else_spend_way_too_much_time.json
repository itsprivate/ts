So lately I&#39;ve found myself spending too much time gazing out the window imagining what life will be like when I can finally submit my resignation letter and pursue my passion projects full time. This, of course, won&#39;t happen anytime soon as I need my portfolio to return a 2000% profit before I can retire with the quality of life I want. Until then I&#39;ll continue mining this fiat, but it&#39;s nice being able to day dream about a happier future. I now finally understand why people waste their money on lottery tickets.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I can&#39;t quit my job, unfortunately. My parents sacrificed everything—including immigrating to a foreign country—to get me to where I am today. And until I earn enough so that my parents can comfortably retire, I have no choice but to continue mining this fiat. I just hope crypto gets me to my goals a little earlier.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
