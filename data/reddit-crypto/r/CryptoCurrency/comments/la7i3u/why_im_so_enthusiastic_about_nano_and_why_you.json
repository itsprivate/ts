  "selftext": "This is a longread, so **tl;dr** \\- Nano's UX and fundamentals are incredible (try it out yourself), has a large (developer) community around it, and also has a lot of price upside.\n\nSo it seems that despite having commented about Nano fairly often on this subreddit I've never laid out just why I'm so enthusiastic about Nano. So in this post - my reason for being so enthusiastic about Nano, how you can try Nano out within 2 minutes, and what the future for Nano might be like.\n\n# Why am I so enthusiastic about Nano?\n\nI got into crypto because I believe in having a decentralised digital currency. I believe that a future in which all people have direct access to an undebaseable, self-sovereign currency is a far better future than a future in which we are bound to using fiat currencies to pay.\n\nI believe Nano is the currency that stands the best chance at being this decentralised digital currency. I'm in agreement with Elon Musk that when it comes to currencies, \"[whichever has least error & latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)\". There needs to be as little friction as possible in currencies as possible - in terms of latency, throughput, and fees. How does Nano fit in here? Well, Nano's fundamentals are as follows:\n\n* [Lowest latency cryptocurrency](https://nanocrawler.cc/network) (0.15 seconds to fully confirm, on average)\n* Zero fees - no leeching middlemen\n* Incredibly secure - deterministic finality versus the probabilistic finality of traditional cryptocurrencies\n* Has never had a double spend, re-organisation, or inflation bug\n* Had a [third party security audit](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/nano-protocol-security-audit-summary-and-full-report-48760be8ab3d)\n* No inflation - fully distributed\n* Incredibly energy efficient/green - the entire network can run on roughly one windmill\n* High throughput ([200 CPS+ in latest stresstests](https://forum.nano.org/t/nano-stress-tests-measuring-bps-cps-tps-in-the-real-world/436)), still improving passively by scaling through hardware and actively through development.\n* Usable as an method of exchange (i.e. directly spendable) - that  means that early whales won't all have to \"cash out\" to take profits,  they really could use it for goods/services directly\n\nI understand that these are lofty claims, and that they sound unbelievable. However, all of these can be verified either through the [Nano protocol/website](https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/) or through links I've added. A more practical approach would be to verify the low latency, feelessness and great user experience for yourself by taking two minutes to try it out.\n\n# How to try out Nano\n\n1. Install Natrium ([Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.banano.natriumwallet), [iOS here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/natrium/id1451425707?ls=1&mt=8)).\n2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://nano-faucet.org/).\n3. Fill in your Nano\\_ address and hit send.\n\nThat's all! To really try it out I'd recommend getting a second wallet such as [Nault (web-based)](https://nault.cc/) or Nalli ([Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.heimo.nalli),[ iOS here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1515601975)),  then sending some Nano from your first wallet to the second.\n\nI think trying it out is the single best way to experience the user experience/speed that we Nano enthusiasts are always raving about. I also believe that, given that it takes just two minutes, it's worth taking some time out of your day to verify or disprove these claims that are so often made. I've tried my fair share of cryptos and wallets, and I can tell you I have never seen a crypto-related user experience that can compete with using Natrium to send and receive NANO.\n\nIf I'm right, then Nano might be an incredible opportunity. If I'm wrong, then you can discount these Nano claims from now on and save yourself a lot of time.\n\n**Wait, people are giving Nano away for free?**\n\nYes, many people are just **that** enthusiastic about Nano. I think that practically everyone here on r/cc can attest to the fact that Nano enthusiasts are a very big group, and a very active group.\n\n[I couldn't resist adding this in here.](https://preview.redd.it/dg3787bvaue61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab31fa3c87993bd114f9915543a7faca8dd64e58)\n\nIt's not just r/cc though. A different crypto subreddit recently (literally) had their entire hot page filled with Nano posts, r/nanocurrency is an incredibly active subreddit, and even on other subreddits around Reddit you'll often run into Nano posts and comments. The same holds true for Twitter - Nano is consistently in the top 3 most talked about cryptocurrencies on Twitter.\n\nLuckily though, it's not just a bunch of shills and enthusiasts. Nano also has a very large developer community around it building awesome stuff on Nano. The Natrium wallet was named before, but there's also a [great web/desktop wallet in Nault](https://nault.cc/), the awesome [Nalli wallet](https://nalli.app/) that allows you to send Nano to anyone using their phone number, and even recently got [the first cryptocurrency wallet for KaiOS](https://kaiak.cc/), the second largest mobile OS in India and many developing countries.\n\nOn top of that, there are Nano TipBots for practically every platform, such as for [Reddit](https://github.com/danhitchcock/nano_tipper_z)/[Twitter/Telegram](https://nanotipbot.com/)/[Whatsapp](https://thenanobot.com/), and there is so much development happening that it's [just too much to list in this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/kkgq8h/looking_back_on_a_year_of_nano_development/). One more thing I'd like to point out is [WeNano](https://wenano.net/), a newer app that functions as a wallet and allows users to create hotspots that grant free Nano to others based on their location. It's like Pokemon Go, but then for crypto. WeNano has already exploded in use worldwide, especially in 3rd world countries where these undebaseable, self-sovereign currencies are needed most.\n\n**This all sounds pretty fantastic so.. why has the price been declining?**\n\nTo be fair, the price has roughly quadrupled since a month ago. But it's true, Nano had a huge run-up in 2017 peaking at $30+ shortly. The bull market ended shortly thereafter, and Nano had a massive decline of nearly 99% over the next couple of years, not exactly helped by one of the two exchanges on which Nano was traded having a double withdraw bug + an exit-scamming exchange owner.\n\nThings have begun to change. NANO bottomed out with the rest of the crypto space, went through a healthy accumulation phase, and has since begun showing signs of life yet again. It's been going up a fair bit lately, and more importantly Nano is experiencing a massive increase in interest. It's actually the reason I've been less active in r/cc \\- I literally cannot keep up with all the DMs, Discord messages, chats and questions elsewhere I get about Nano. This is no hard data, but I'm pretty sure I alone have sent to over 300 newly opened wallets this past weekend because people wanted to try Nano out, and the faucets are seeing a surge in use as well.\n\n**So what is the price upside here?**\n\nI think I've described well enough why this is exciting from the perspective of someone interested in the tech and wanting to have a global decentralised digital currency, but what is the price potential here? To be honest, I am loath to do price forecasts, so here are some reasons I think Nano will go up, strongly, in the near future, without having an idea as to how much this will be.\n\n**Exchanges.** Nano recently got listed on some exchanges (BitcoinSuisse for institutional investors, AnchorUSD for a direct USD gateway + exchanges in Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia) but *still* isn't listed on **Coinbase**. The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. This could be a coincidence, but it's positive either way. Additionally, in another showing of Nano's big community, the post requesting Nano be added to Coinbase is now the [all-time most upvoted post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/l8lcwl/is_nano_cryptocurrency_planned_to_be_added_on/) on r/coinbase. Plus, Garry Tan, one of the early investors is [presumably still invested in Nano](https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1231029507638693889). Another exchange that could list Nano is **Gemini,** and the good news here is that the twins have recently gotten more interested in Nano in the sense that they're liking Nano posts on Twitter. Thin proof, but it's something!\n\nThe most hopium part of all is of course Elon Musk. His [least error & latency](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) post combined with him looking into crypto makes me hope that he'll run across Nano and try it out. The Nano community has recently developed a knack for getting their posts in front of people they want to know about Nano ([see also Raoul Pal](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1353531308748767234)), and it's my hope this also gets the ultimate first principles engineer to give Nano a look [through this tweetstorm.](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1356277209212858371)\n\nIn essence, my thinking here - Nano has extremely good fundamentals, a large and enthusiastic (developer) community, a lot of price upside, hence is worth a look for anyone regardless of what got you into cryptocurrency.\n\nI'd love to hear what people here think, and if anyone has any questions about Nano I'd love to answer them.",
