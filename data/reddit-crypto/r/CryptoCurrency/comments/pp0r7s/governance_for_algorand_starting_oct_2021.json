  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just as another reminder, governance for Algorand, a pure proof of stake blockchain, is coming in Oct 2021. So from Oct 2021 until Oct 2022 you can receive BOTH governance AND participation rewards (participation rewards at 6% which you get by just hodling ALGO). The total rewards (governance + participation) can range from 12% to up to 30% depending on how much total ALGO gets staked for governance. I cannot stress how insane that is. At worst you&#39;re DOUBLING your rewards and at best you&#39;re FIVE Xing your rewards. And all Algorand holders can participate to sign up and become a governor in Oct 2021 when they drop the sign up. Do NOT sleep on Algorand.</p>\n\n<p>For more specific info here is their official youtube vid about this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/224LsnCJdj0\">https://youtu.be/224LsnCJdj0</a></p>\n\n<p>Algorand imo is a great project so please help spread the word. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Had to repost this sorry. I had to get premium in order the post to go through. Not enough karma arghh.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: Whoa my first Reddit awards! Thanks guys!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: Some clarifying points for my own edification. 1) Governance is a quarterly thing (every 3 months) you choose can be a part of it or not each quarter. 2) <strong>They will still have participation rewards until the end of 2022</strong>, however will slowly be scaled down in 2022 (per the video at 9:22).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
