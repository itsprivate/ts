I can see in the future games like GTA with NFT cars and weapons and even clothes. That would revolutionize gaming. Maybe an RPG games with player based economies with different professions and loot that is all NFT. I think the future is bright but we’re no where near the point where is worth getting into. I think if all these crypto games had no crypto involved they would be dead the next day with the exception of crypto royale ( which is super fun). What are your opinions? Any games out there that are worth your time?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
