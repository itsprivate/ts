What would I do if I woke up to my portfolio hitting my target price? I would tell my wife to quit her job and I would put in my 2 weeks with my employer.</p>\n\n<p>To my employer: I would politely tell them that I need to quit my job in oder to “find myself” \nsaying something along the lines of needing some “soul searching”. \nIt comes across professionally neutral yet ambiguous. Most importantly, it leaves them guessing without burning any bridges or bad blood- just in case things go belly up.</p>\n\n<p>To my family: I would tell them I took up a an opportunity of a lifetime within my company, a dream position that sounds too good to be true, because it is. This “dream job” would allow me to travel the world and financially provide me the means to justify any bigger purchases like a home or providing for a child. </p>\n\n<p>To everyone else: They’ll see what they see with whatever I decide to share online with my new found freedom and travel. Honestly, I would most likely fall of socially- at least for a while. \nNow if someone really presses me for details, I would vaguely regurgitate what I originally told my family but with even less details. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone asks if I’m still invested in crypto, i’ll tell them all I sold before it pumped and how I’ll kick myself every day for doing so. </p>\n\n<p>You may be asking, would I go to all this trouble? Because fuck them!- respectfully. </p>\n\n<p>Having money can change a lot in your life, including how people see and treat you; your family unfortunately isn’t immune from this. All of a sudden you become an ATM. You’re seen as a resource, a safety net. Random people old and new start wanting to be your “friend”, or you might start getting phone calls from family members you haven’t heard from in years. You don’t want to end up in this position. It’s emotionally exhausting and potentially causing irreversible damage with those you love. </p>\n\n<p>This isn’t always the case, but more often then not, if you tell people you have money, especially if you’re young, or if you live recklessly, not staying in your lane, then you’ll quickly find yourself back in your old cubicle. </p>\n\n<p>Stay humble, stay hungry, keep DCA’ing and when you sell, don’t say a fucking word. </p>\n\n<p>I wish you all much success and happiness for many cycles to come.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
