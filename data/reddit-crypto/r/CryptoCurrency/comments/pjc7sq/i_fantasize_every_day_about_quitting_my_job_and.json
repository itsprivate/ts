I work remote and have a decent salary, which I’m grateful for. But my company has no resiliency, I have no backup, I haven’t taken a true day off in 2 years. My boss is a dumbass. Our CEO died this summer unexpectedly at the age of 43. We are a startup and we are a fucking mess.</p>\n\n<p>The stress is always there, every day. All the people in all the departments are stressed out to the max. People are having health issues, people get fired or quit very frequently. Those who stay have to do more and more each week. We’re all burned out and pissed off.</p>\n\n<p>Every day I’m dreaming of a 10x bump in my crypto portfolio. I don’t have a lot, so I can’t quit yet. And honestly it’s the same way with every job that I’ve had. They all suck. Working for someone, any company or institution, effing blows. It doesn’t matter public or private sector. I’ve done multiple in each and it’s the same story. I just want to opt out, but I’m married, and we may have a kid some day.</p>\n\n<p>All I know is, I want flexibility in life. I want to not be trapped. I want to be free in my professional career, to try new things and do what I want. I need a safety net to do that. I’m hoping crypto can do that for me. I think we still have a ways to go in this bull run. I’m hoping by mid next year I can quit my job, and start living the life that I want to live. </p>\n\n<p>Can anyone else relate? Who’s with me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
