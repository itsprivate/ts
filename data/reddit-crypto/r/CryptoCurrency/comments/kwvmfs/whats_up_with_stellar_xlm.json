Compared to other projects, Stellar is getting adopted by banks, financial institutions, and top-tier companies.\n\nSecond, if you try Stellar, you’ll be amazed just how fast and quick XLM gets to your wallet. More or less than 2 seconds. It is no doubt why on [Coinstats,](https://www.coinstats.network) Stellar is the number 1 when it comes to transaction volumes. For the sake of simplicity, it means Stellar blockchain is being used more than any other chains.\n\nUkraine choosing Stellar to test and create their CBDC is also one of the greatest achievements of Stellar.\n\nUSDC will also come to Stellar on February 2021. What does it mean for users? Well, no more cursing the damn USDC fees because of HIGH ETH GAS FEES.\n\nYou can exchange your crypto to USDC easily on Stellar and send it for a fraction of a cent at an ultra-speed.\n\nFurthermore, it is no doubt that Stellar is the main player in cross-border payments, remittances, CBDC, and asset tokenization.\n\nBut wait that’s only the tip of the iceberg!\n\nStellar also has a native DEX, and they are working on turing smart contract. There is already a Stellar Smart Contract but with turing it will be better.\n\nYou will also find Stablecoins on Stellar not found on any other blockchain e.g. **Philippine Peso, Nigerian Naira, Chinese Yuan, Mexican Peso, Euro, Brazilian Real, and Argentine Peso.** And guess what? They are 100% backed 1:1, because you can’t issue Stablecoins on stellar if you are not regulated or licensed. That’s also the reason why one of the [world’s oldest banks](https://www.coindesk.com/one-of-the-worlds-oldest-banks-is-issuing-a-euro-stablecoin-on-stellar)  issued their EURO on Stellar. \n\nYou can also try to play [Litemint](https://www.litemint.io). It is a game built on Stellar, and you’ll also get an NFT if you win the competition and earn CREDITS which you can trade for XLM on Stellar DEX(SDEX). You can download Lobstr or Solar from App Store and Play Store to interact with SDEX.\n\nSee? Stellar does not only change the way payment works. You can also play games. There are more use cases, but I suggest you go to Stellar to learn more.",
