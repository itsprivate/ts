It’s the people’s money: Tail Emission ensures the networks security indefinitely, while Bitcoins security is at risk when there’s no more supply increase. </p>\n\n<p>Will tx fees be enough to secure the Bitcoin network? One that is completely transparent for the world to analyse? How about Eth, that rich mans playground?</p>\n\n<p>If you’re ignoring Monero now TRUST ME you still be crying about it in 5 years time. Stop investing in SHIT. LoopCrap, VAG and BAL nft social contracts BULLSHIT - nobody cares guys. </p>\n\n<p>Monero is powerful enough to uphold entire underworld economies, entire nations. </p>\n\n<p>Look up White House market.
