I haven&#39;t researched much on what&#39;s been going on with Algorand but I was surprised to see its dedicated ASA subreddit has 18k members. Memecoins and scam coins are booming in that sub. Almost every day there&#39;s an airdrop, either scam or not.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, if I&#39;m not mistake, this the sign the chain has good traction. Even when there are many scam coins running on it. I imagine like in Pancakeswap era.</p>\n\n<p>Is Algorand&#39;s future that bright? Could it reach Top 5 one day? Are you all start swapping and allocating more ALGOS or experimenting with their ASAs? What ASA you most excited about?</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t seen any ASA hitting major exchanges so I&#39;m curious if it&#39;ll be a thing one day?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
