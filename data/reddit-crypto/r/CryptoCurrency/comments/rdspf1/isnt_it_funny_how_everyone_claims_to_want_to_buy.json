I think it’s just funny how human psychology works we always want to jump in with the pumps in price but soon as it’s red we all start being bearish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a load of rubbish when some people are saying they want it to go lower so they can buy the dip. Don’t fool yourself you will be too scared as usual and this is why the same people keep winning in bitcoin and you don’t. The smart money is always buying the dips, instead of talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rant over&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
