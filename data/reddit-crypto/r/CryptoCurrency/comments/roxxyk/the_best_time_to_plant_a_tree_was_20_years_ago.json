There’s also a ton of pseudo-technical posts explaining how every little dip means the next big bear winter is coming and how each tiny pump means the parabolic moonshot is finally here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is nobody knows what will happen next, and your guess is probably about as good as most other people’s. The other reality is that most of us missed getting in early enough to become a millionaire on small investments. That doesn’t mean that you can’t still make money and be involved with interesting projects with room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe that crypto has a place in the future, then buy projects that make sense to you, turn off your phone, and go outside or do something fun. If you really think ETH will hit $10k eventually, then buying it at any price under that is a great investment in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing most folks who have profited off crypto have in common is that they were patient when others weren’t and they bought things that, through some combination of luck and foresight, were built to last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn’t plant trees when crypto was first on the scene, but if you think the future is a forest, you can still plant now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
