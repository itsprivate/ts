Tom said “I’m giving him a Bitcoin too so he’s still getting a pretty decent deal.” </p>\n\n<p>We all know Brady is in on crypto but idk, thought it was cool and makes me wonder if TB12 is even more of a believer than we realize—seeing an opportunity to insert Bitcoin into a topic people are talking about and taking it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
