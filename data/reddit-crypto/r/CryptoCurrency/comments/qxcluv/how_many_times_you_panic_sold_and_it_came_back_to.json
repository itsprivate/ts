How much convinced you were when you panic sold? Was it worth it? Or you fell for a astrologer too? </p>\n\n<p>I hope we could give some of our experiences to the newbies and help each other cope with the dip. One thing that is certain in crypto space is that blue chips always goes back up. Other than that Holding is not a bad idea if you invest in a solid project and are in it for long term. Many projects has shown astronomical returns after a crash or dip. Just remember that time in market beats timing the market. DCA, HODL and stake. Its not a get rich quick scheme, patience will pay in long term. You&#39;ll get there eventually.</p>\n\n<h1>Don&#39;t panic, and think rationally!</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
