  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks have statistically returned 8-11% every single year since the 1940s. Crypto has been soaring to higher lows every year, and it&amp;#39;s showing no signs of stopping now. All time highs are nice, and everyone loves when a coin moons, but the real value with crypto investments is yearly returns. The technology that powers crypto gives it it&amp;#39;s value, and it&amp;#39;s only becoming more streamlined, mainstream, and &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto.com is getting their own &lt;em&gt;stadium&lt;/em&gt; named after them. If this doesn&amp;#39;t scream &amp;quot;invest now before it hits the banks&amp;quot; then I don&amp;#39;t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s coming, the future of crypto is coming and it&amp;#39;s certainly not too early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put things into perspective, would you go to a financial advisor and ask if it was too early to invest in stocks? Of course not, because the answer would always be &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s all about &lt;em&gt;how long you plan to invest&lt;/em&gt;. 1 year in stocks won&amp;#39;t get you much, but 40 years in a 401(k) will leave you with an amazing retirement fund if invested properly. Time is your friend in stocks, and also in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it too late to invest in Tesla? Nope. Apple? Nope. Bitcoin? Nope. Ethereum? Nope. We&amp;#39;re just getting started, and even after the future is shaped by crypto it still won&amp;#39;t be too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never too late, ever. &lt;em&gt;Time in the market beats timing the market. Always&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
