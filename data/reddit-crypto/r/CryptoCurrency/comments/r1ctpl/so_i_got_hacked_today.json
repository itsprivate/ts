Here&#39;s what happened - hopefully others will learn from my dumb ass mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>A week ago I moved some money into a defi protocol.  Wonderland.  While moving things around and connecting my wallet it seems I was the victim of a phishing scam and I allowed access to my wallet to a site I didn&#39;t recognize.  I was already on a few sites that had connections to my wallet and assumed it was one of them asking for something.  Apparently I clicked yes when my metamask asked for connection to another site.  I had figured it was just one of the others that I was already on... traderjoe, wonderland and abracadabra.  I also connected it to DeBank.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I found the funds were all gone and transferred to this wallet:</p>\n\n<p>0x34b58707e43904137ea1f8cd1d554571f650e8c2</p>\n\n<p>This person has been stealing funds from a lot of people it seems.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully I only lost about 5k but it still hurts.  That&#39;s a good chunk of my hard earned money and really all the throw away cash I had for defi experiments.  It was clearly my fault.</p>\n\n<p>Security wise I do use random generated passwords stored in a bitwarden account.  I have avast and have never had a virus / malware positive hit on my computer.  I had multiple accounts on this metamask wallet but only one was looted leading me to the conclusion they did not have my passwords.  I have since disconnected the wallets to all sites now.  Unfortunately I panicked and disconnected them before I could identify which connection was the phishing attack.  If anyone has info that could help me see what it was connected to when it happened I would be thankful for that.</p>\n\n<p>I have been aware of hardware wallets for basically forever and am a total fool for not getting and using one.  I&#39;ve ordered a Ledger Nano S to help keep me safe in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Please, learn this expensive lesson from me and not from your own wallet.  Get a hardware ledger or use multisignature on your wallet.  Keep an eye on all connections and remove them when they are no longer necessary.</p>\n\n<p>This fucking sucks.  I&#39;m so angry at myself.  This is going to be a terrible thanksgiving.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway... rant over.  I hope at least someone can learn from this and not have it happen to them.  Any further advice I am happy to hear.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck out there...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
