And it sure as hell is working to this point congrats. </p>\n\n<p>But the problem is many of you newbies don’t understand MC I just got flamed for pointing out to two people that shiba will not EVER hit a penny (.01). I was accused of it being just like BTC to 10k and doge to 50 cent. Okay no shib is like neither of those. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s revisit market cap shall we? The market cap is a metric we use to compare coins to one another it’s THE thing to check when you want to know potential price action of a coin. MC= circulating supply x current market price. BTC is the #1 coin at 1.1T (1 decimal place) MC. You can calculate that with $60,300 (current Market price) x 17 million (circulating supply). No one with a brain should believe your coin will surpass this. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at shib shall we. A current MC of 17 billion. It’s got some room to run sure. Will it get to a penny? No shot. Why? MC. To get to 1 cent shib will need to 238x from here. That would be a market cap of 17B x 238 = over 4T. All of crypto is currently 2.55T. It’s NOT HAPPENING THIS RUN. </p>\n\n<p>If you are new I hope this helps cause I doubt your influencer who told you to buy explained this. If you made money great but no your $50 will not 300x you will not hit $1 the supply continues to go up daily making it even harder. I hope this helps.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: to those who are commenting like it can happen beat of luck. If it does save this post hit me up and I’ll record me chewing my show strings of 3 year old shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: bring on the downvotes shib gang. Sorry for trying to educate you. /s im not sorry for telling the hard truth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
