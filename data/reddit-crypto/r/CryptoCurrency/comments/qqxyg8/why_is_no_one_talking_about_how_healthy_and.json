There have been several significant corrections that wiped out as much as 20-50% of the market in a day leading up to the ceiling. This time we haven&#39;t even had a double digit correction for a long time. </p>\n\n<p>Hell, even seeing a red day is rare! If anything, any corrections are actually prolonged and healthy leading up to even bigger gains. IMO the bigger market cap is driving the market towards more stability. It&#39;s absolutely incredible how healthy this bull run is!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
