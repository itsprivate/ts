My dog turned 11 in June and I know he’s getting older but he’s been there for me when I needed him most, and I feel I owe the many anonymous people in this sub a thank you for giving me a chance to help him get back to a pain free life.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you so much for the words of encouragement!!! I will be doing the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Updating this post with how the surgery goes (the soonest I can schedule it is a month out).</p></li>\n<li><p>Sending pics of my good boy to anyone who sends me a message asking, I literally have hundreds and I’d love to share!</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for the awards also! I’ve never really gotten those before haha. God bless!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
