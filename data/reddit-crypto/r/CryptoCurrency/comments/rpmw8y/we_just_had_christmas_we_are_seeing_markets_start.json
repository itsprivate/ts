Watch the market and learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The best advice does not come in the form of a YouTube video, Facebook ad or a PM from some random on Reddit.  It comes from doing some searching, reading official home pages of coins and looking at the merit of their project. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When something is pumping, you don’t have to jump in.  This is FOMO (fear of missing out). It isn’t always bad but please make sure you have a handle on the market before you make rash decisions. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don’t do leveraged trading. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, have fun!  People on here can be crazy and the memes can be weird. But it’s just people having fun (for the most part). Don’t get over invested and don’t take things too seriously!  Good luck, make some money.  Don’t forget about taxes depending on your region!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
