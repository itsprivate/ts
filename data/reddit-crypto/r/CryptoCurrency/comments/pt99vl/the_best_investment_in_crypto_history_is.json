  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>OK so this crypto hits every check box.  It&#39;s Proof-of-Stake.  It has 25 percent of the transactions that ETH has presently.  It has a market cap 1/100th of ETH.  It costs pennies to send the crypto.  Gas fees are pennies.  Huge growth.  The market has just beaten down the price by about 40 percent to boot.  Valuation websites are saying that based on its growth it should be worth 3x its current market cap already.  </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing about ETH that no one wants to talk about seriously.  Sure it has the most projects but those projects are put in handcuffs by the very high gas fees.  It should not cost 50 dollars to move a coin.  So if I am a new developer why would I pick ETH as a platform to host my APP or Project?  What is the only advantage it has?  Size.  It&#39;s a big elephant with a lot of people pumping money into it because they assume size means it can&#39;t be taken down.  It absolutely can be taken down.  You&#39;re going to see projects moving ERC-20 coins entirely over to Tezos soon.  Because the odds go up that their project will be usable by people looking to use it a lot.  </p>\n\n<p>For instance.  I had a token called AMP that is hosted on ETH.  I wanted to stake the coin but decided I would feel trapped if I did.  It shouldn&#39;t be expensive to stake a coin and then unstake a coin in short period of time.  Our NFT projects are all selling out on Oneof.  Tezos is going to 100 billion market cap and ETH is close to its peak market cap.  Do you want something that can do 20x or 3x?  The answer is pretty obvious.  Maybe if ETH could move to Proof of Stake immediately they would stand a chance.  But I&#39;m making a prediction that TEZOs is about to be moved up from the minors into the BIGS.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
