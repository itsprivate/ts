Peace & love..*\n\nFor context: Some guy over on the Doge subreddit is posting his Dogecoin gains and bragging about being a Doge millionaire. When I first saw that post my mind was blown. I was under the impression that this guy was an average retail investor that invested a couple thousand and became a millionaire from it. Well, that's far from the truth. Naturally, I wanted to dig a little deeper and find out more about this guy. What I found out is that he's not being very transparent about these astronomical gains.\n\nHis original investment wasn't a few thousand, or even 10 thousand, it was 188k. That is no small amount of money to be throwing around at a meme coin. This isn't some \"rags to riches\" story you're seeing, this guy is obviously very wealthy to begin with. When you have 188k to invest, it's much easier to make 1 million. As opposed to your average investor, if they only have a few thousand to work with, it's near impossible to hit that 1 million dollar mark.\n\nNot only that, but this guy posted a few days ago and showed that he still hasn't taken profits and doesn't plan on it yet, so he's now far from having 1 million gains. Considering the price of Doge right now, he's probably sitting at 350k..... and his original investment was 188k. Let's do the math, shall we. This means the dude is sitting at $162,000 profit. While that's amazing and incredible, it's a far cry from $1,000,000.\n\nDon't believe anything you see online and remember always to question everything. I just felt like this dudes post was misleading and it can make normal retail investors FOMO into Doge so they can be just like him only to be burnt in the end. In reality, this dude was very wealthy before Doge. Just remember, not everything is how it looks.",
