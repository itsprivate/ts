It&#39;s such an obvious rookie mistake.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m not totally new to the cryptosphere. I&#39;m starting to get involved more in the world and was allowed in on a testnet. I went through the process of adding the network and when I did, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get back to the mainnet. Metamask wasn&#39;t switching back. I thought I must have fucked myself. On little sleep and in the wee hours of the morning, I started to panic. Restore metamask. Gotta do it. </p>\n\n<p>I get on my browser and type in metamask. First result is &quot;restore-metamask.com&quot; I&#39;m still screaming &quot;FUCKING MORON!&quot; at myself for this, but I clicked it. </p>\n\n<p>Looks official. I mean they have the metamask fox logo. Not just anyone can have a fuck-damn fox on their homepage. Real nice site. I don&#39;t even register what I&#39;ve done. It asks for a seed phrase. I oblige. The whole damn thing I type out, without a second thought. </p>\n\n<p>I get into my wallet. My funds are...there. but I can&#39;t click anything. No other options. Right then, a wave of gut wrenching realization came over me, a minute late. </p>\n\n<p>I grab my phone and uninstall metamask, then reinstall it, as I had read this is another way to get back to the mainnet. I go through the proper process to restore and I get into my wallet. Everything is still there. Quickly, I transfer all I can, except a little eth for gas fees. After cleaning out into a new wallet, I left $13 of ETH in the metamask. A fine bit of bait to see if my suspicions (well founded) were accurate (they were). Minutes later, I check and it&#39;s gone. They got in. They took all they could. I&#39;m lucky I had a very brief window of opportunity to move my bags to a different wallet.</p>\n\n<p>All this is really embarrassing to throw down on the table for y&#39;all, but I figured if I can share my $13 dollar lesson with just one more sleep deprived newbie, it&#39;ll not be a total waste. Be safe.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
