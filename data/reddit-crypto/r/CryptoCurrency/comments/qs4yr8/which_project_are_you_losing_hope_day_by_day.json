There were some disappointing coins as well which had many expectations but failed. Then there were some coins/tokens which literally didn&#39;t pump on it&#39;s own but got dragged upward by BTC pump. So which coin you are or were holding that you have no hope for it&#39;s future. Mention the reasons so it helps others to make their own decision. Also I would like to know what made you invest in that project.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
