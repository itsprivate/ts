This will apply to both private individuals and business clients. The interest on deposits under 150,000 euros will remain unchanged at 0%. \n\n[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/)\n\n> Rabobank has become the latest Dutch bank to charge customers if they have savings of above €100,000. The bank will now levy a rate of 0.5% on savings of over €100,000 from July 1. The change, the bank says, will impact on just 4% of its customers. ING and Volksbank have already introduced negative interest on savings above €100,000, while ABN Amro has a limit of €150,000. The move, Rabobank says, has been prompted by continuing low market interest rates.\n\n[https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000](https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000)\n\n> ING customers with more than a hundred thousand euros in their account must pay a savings interest of 0.5% on this from 1 July. The bank will then lower the negative interest threshold from € 250,000 to € 100,000.  \n>  \n>The negative interest applies to both business and private ING customers with more than € 100,000 in their accounts. ING emphasizes that the interest applies per account and not per customer. Spreading money over several (savings) accounts at the bank would thus offer another chance to escape the negative interest rate. On the other hand, there are higher costs per month for holding multiple accounts.\n\nConclusion: FUCK BANKS. CRYPTOCURRENCY'S ARE THE FUTURE.",
