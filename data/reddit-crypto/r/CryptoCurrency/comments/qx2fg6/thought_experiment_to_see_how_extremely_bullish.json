But this time, somehow, you can&#39;t buy any crypto for 10 years (yes, even Monero). </p>\n\n<p>Now you&#39;re thinking...</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate question â€” you&#39;re offered all the same conditions, 1 million dollars, but you have to give crypto for ever â€” never buy or obtain, directly or through intermediaries, any crypto (yes, MOONs too).</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d still come across articles about crypto bull runs and dips and crashes, unprecedented all time highs, flippenings, moonshots and all that stuff â€” you wouldn&#39;t look for it, but the way the media is things like that would just pop up. Your friends and family would eventually bring crypto up in conversations with you...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tldr: So, would you give up on crypto for life for $1M now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>PS: Although my portfolio is far from 7 digits, I wouldn&#39;t take the the deal for 3 reasons. First, I&#39;m strangely confident my handpicked bags of alts can do better than that in the long run. Second, I wouldn&#39;t want to deny myself the possibility to invest into crypto further, even those staking, DEFI lending apys are hard to beat. And third, this thought experiment has shown me I&#39;m not in it entirely for the money, not entirely for the tech, â€” for the most part, I&#39;m into crypto for the ride ðŸŽ¢ðŸš€ðŸ¤˜ </p>\n\n<p>I hope this little thought experiment gave you some perspective.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
