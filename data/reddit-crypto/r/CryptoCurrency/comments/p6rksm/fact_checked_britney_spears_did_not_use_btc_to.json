This is really unlikely. Here&#39;s why:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>She never explicitly talked about crypto or even BTC in any public interview or the podcast</p></li>\n<li><p>This is just speculation based on the next episode of the podcast. There has literally been no confirmation of those that run it</p></li>\n<li><p>All this news come from crypto newspapers, they will only give hopium and bullish news because that&#39;s what gets them visibility, but they won&#39;t fact check</p></li>\n<li><p>Probably there is a hidden reason behind this, someone may be using this fakes news to pump the price (if hedge funds do it with negative stories to short, why not positive stories to pump the price and sell high)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know the story seems cool and it would be great if it actually happened but it seems really really unlikely to be true, as a sub we must do better to keep good content</p>\n\n<p>The only news I found on the internet were all crypto websites, no real newspaper like Washington Post, Bloomberg etc took the story. This are the guys that fact check their stories and that&#39;s why there has been no mass media coverage</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Also I think it&#39;s very unlikely because for those that wanted to buy/use BTC back in 2014-2015 and even 2016 you had to be know a lot (be submerged if you want) into computing and most exchanges/sites were either sketchy as hell or a scam</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I was going to list my sources but the post gets taken down because they are sketchy as hell (as this whole story is)</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
