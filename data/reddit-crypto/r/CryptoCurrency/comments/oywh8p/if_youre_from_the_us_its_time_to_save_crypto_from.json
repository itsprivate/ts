This would be functionally impossible to do and would deprive [state citizens] of legitimate investment opportunities. The language will not bring in any extra tax revenue…the only effect it will have will be to drive innovation and profits in the most innovative area of finance overseas, depriving citizens of [your state] of jobs and punishing them for making regular investments. </p>\n\n<p>Please vote YES on Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment to the infrastructure bill, and vote NO on the Warner-Portman amendment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Info on the amendment: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577\">https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577</a></p>\n\n<p>Your senator’s phone number can be found here:\n<a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm\">https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Even easier: <a href=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/\">https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/</a></p>\n\n<p>This website directly connects you to your senator with a script you can read off of!</p>\n\n<p>Save crypto, do your part.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
