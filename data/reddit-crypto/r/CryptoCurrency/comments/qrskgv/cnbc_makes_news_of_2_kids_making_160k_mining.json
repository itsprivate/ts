They started mining with 3 dollars a day, which is what I get with my 2060 ($349), but then their operations grow majestically, how majestically you say? <strong>$64K per month!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you, there is no fuckin way in the planet earth that you can get these numbers without a mining farm. Let&#39;s continue!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>“We have configured our computers to constantly scan for the most profitable coin and switch to that coin automatically,”</em></strong>  If i need to translate it to English, Ishaan is either a super genius coder that can make a super complex AI. Or, they simply use NiceHash, which is what i use and does all this stuff automatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>“Even though we are now making a lot of money, we are just as proud now as we were when we only made $3 per day, since our main prize is not the money,”</em></strong> I dont get why they act like its their achievement, its just that they poured a fortune to their rigs but, &quot;How much?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Now you remember when I said, &quot;What they don&#39;t say&quot;. Now that&#39;s kind of a lie cause just when I thought the article ended, there is a sweet spot that explains how they make that much money.</p>\n\n<p>See, their father Manish Raj, did something that I laughed the shit out of myself once I read. He took a loan for his kids to Mine Cryptocurrency. Yes, you heard me right, he took a LOAN, for his kids to mine Crypto! Honestly, my father of the year award goes for the Manish!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, how much processor does little Ishaan has? Well, hope you&#39;re ready cause shit is about to get real!</p>\n\n<p>14-year-old Ishaan has:</p>\n\n<p><strong>100 NVIDIA RTX 3090!</strong></p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p><strong>50 NVIDIA RTX 3070 TI!</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a huge chip shortage going on right now so no fuckin way he got these cards by the retailer prices, but let&#39;s say Manish is a close friend of Nvidia&#39;s CEO, which I must say, you probably need to be to give that much money to your kids. He still would need to spend, AT LEAST $150.000 on GPUs with $1500 per card!</p>\n\n<p>And you know what&#39;s funny? RTX 3090 isn&#39;t even a good GPU for mining. of course, its hash rate is an incredible 108 which is a lot, But, it&#39;s not very efficient in Hash/$ perspective, as it needs 291 days to pay its price, while GTX 1060 only needs 159.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
