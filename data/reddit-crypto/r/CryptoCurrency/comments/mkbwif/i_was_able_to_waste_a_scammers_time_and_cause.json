I usually just block and report them but this time I decided to have some fun and play along. \n\nSo, as usual,  the scammer sends me a link to a fake website and asks me to \"validate\" my wallet to receive rewards. I decided to open the link, but of course on private browsing mode with all my other windows closed just in case. The website asked me to type in my 12 word wallet seed and I just typed in \"You are a low life loser who takes the easy way out by trying to steal peoples money\" and the wallet seed was imported successfully. \n\nI typed in a few other more explicit wallet phrases and those were all imported successfully as well. Then I spent the next 15-20 minutes submitting a bunch of fake wallet seeds. I thought maybe if the website was run my multiple scammers I may be able to flood their pool with fake seeds that it will make their job harder to find the real seeds from the actual victims. But I did spend enough time that the scammer shut down their website. \n\nI won't lie, doing that made me feel really good especially if it meant 1 less unsuspecting person falling victim to their ploy. If I was knowledgeable with bots I would have easily had one just spam the website with a bunch of random imported fake wallet gibberish. \n\nThis goes without saying but to those that are new to the cryptocurrency space and made a private wallet(meaning not on a central exchange like Coinbase, Binance, Gemini etc.), don't EVER give ANYONE your private keys, just type in a bunch of fake keys instead and waste their time ;)",
