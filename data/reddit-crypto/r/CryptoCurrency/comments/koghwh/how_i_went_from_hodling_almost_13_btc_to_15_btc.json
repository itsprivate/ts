I had been buying BTC slowly starting in the fall of 2016, and I eventually accumulated almost 13 of them. If I had just tucked those away and never touched them, I feel fairly confident in saying I would be a millionaire within the next 5 years, possibly a multi-millionaire.\n\nBut then, greed struck. I wanted to find the next \"diamond in the rough\" project that no one else knew about, and get in on the ground floor and watch it shoot up 500% over the next year. I was sucked in by a project called QASH, and kudos to you if you've ever even heard of it. I went all in, 100%, on QASH, and in January 2018, QASH hit its ATH and I had about $500,000 to my name. I thought I had done it, that I had picked the right horse, and I'd be a millionaire before the end of 2018. But then, QASH absolutely cratered, but I kept holding out hope it was going to bounce back. Finally, in August, I sold back in to BTC, and I was down to just 5 BTC in my name.\n\nThen, in the fall, we had a family emergency and not enough money to cover it. I was forced to sell my BTC for about $3k each. I eventually ended up selling everything. I had 0 BTC, when just 12 months before, I had half a million dollars.\n\nI finally bought back in once our financial situation stabilized, but could only really afford .65 BTC (1 BTC was worth $10k when I bought back in). But then, just like before, I started looking around at projects that could pay some big dividends. I did a lot of research into Tezos (XTZ), and decided that I liked what they were doing, and that they would be a good investment. I bought all in when it was worth about $3 sometime last spring.\n\nSince that time, Tezos has fallen and is now treading water at about $2. Meanwhile, if I'd left my investment in BTC alone, I'd have about $19k today. My Tezos investment is worth $4,300 by comparison, good for .148 BTC as of this writing.\n\nBottom line is, greed will hurt you. Every time. I still think it's possible Tezos is going to do some big things, but I could have kept my money in BTC and bought into Tezos now and gotten a lot more than what I currently have.\n\nI didn't learn my lesson last time and made the exact same stupid mistake. But at least I still have something, and maybe a glimmer of hope. I just pray that Tezos does not become another QASH.\n\nFeel free to tell me what a moron, idiot, fool, etc I am.",
