Even if I just make $10 out of $100, that is still 10% return in a few months. If I put it in the bank, I will only earn 0.1% pa interest. Clearly the small win from crypto is something to celebrate about. Next time I can set a higher target, and if I make it happen, that will be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>So set your own objectives, follow your plan, and if you win, celebrate it! You can do it now, you can do better too in the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
