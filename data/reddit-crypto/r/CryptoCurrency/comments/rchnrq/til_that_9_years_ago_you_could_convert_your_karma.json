The purpose was to give redditors a few cents (which would be a couple hundred $$ now) to expose them to crypto and learn more about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the exact exchange rate was, but here’s a sample conversion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1,510,146 karma = you get 0.01510146 BTC (worth 15 cents back then, and $744 today)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;543 karma = you get 0.00100543 BTC (worth $50 today)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could also donate it to a public faucet instead of sending it to your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a 100 karma minimum and it was a once-per-user thing. You had to decide whether to cash in right now, or karmawhore some more for a bigger payday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the bot was turned off a few years ago and doesn’t work anymore (but you’re free to still try - who knows?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zqocl/exchange_your_karma_for_bitcoin_reddit_bitcoin/\"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
