You can only buy it on Uniswap at the moment, and it&#39;s up something like 500% in the last 2 days.<br/>\nI&#39;m convinced this is going to be the next big thing and since no one is talking about it (not even on this sub, let alone the mainstream media) I know I&#39;m early.<br/>\nI bought 20 million PUSSY coins yesterday and I&#39;m already up 70%. Not gonna even think about selling until it&#39;s worth 6 or 7 figures. Wish me luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
