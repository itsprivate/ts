First of all would you say the same thing to an unknown artist trying to sell their album? Maybe you’d say yes but you’re probably the same person who doesn’t care about fake merchandise or buying a crack version of a game. </p>\n\n<p>Why NFTs make sense:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Games</strong> - By making an ingame item NFT, players will be able to trade through secondary markets outside of just the game, move between multiple games and platforms. If a gamer’s account is stolen, disabled or if they decide to just quit you can still use or earn back the value of your items instead of it disappearing. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>E.g: <a href=\"https://axieinfinity.com/\">Axie Infinity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cryptokitties.co/\">CryptoKitties</a>, <a href=\"https://lostrelics.io/\">Lost Relics</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Art</strong> - When it comes to art NFT can be anything digital such as drawings, music, videos, etc. With the NFT Technology artists are still able to make money without completely giving up their copyrights.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>E.g: <a href=\"https://paperpeople.io/\">Paper People</a>, <a href=\"https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks\">Crypto Punks</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Business</strong> - Majority of NFTs are using Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent manner. With NFTs using the same tech it’s just a proof that devs can do so much more and create more businesses for crypto users like us.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I just don’t get how people can love cryptocurrency and at the same time hate on or refuse to learn about the technology.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
