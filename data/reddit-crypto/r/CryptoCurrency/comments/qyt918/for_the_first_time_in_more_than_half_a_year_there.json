This was more than enough for it to enter the top 10, as it had multiple times before. But this time, it stayed there for quite a while. A few weeks ago, a second meme coin, SHIB, joined it in the top 10 - as far as I know it was the first time than any other meme coin but DOGE did so.</p>\n\n<p>SHIB already left the top 10 a week or two ago, now DOGE has been kicked out by AVAX. Personally, I&#39;m pretty neutral regarding meme coins - would never buy them but don&#39;t care at all if others do - but I know some of you will be happy about this. What I do dislike, however, is this sub&#39;s tendency to declare meme coins and other coins it doesn&#39;t like dead if they dip a few %, which they would call a &quot;healthy correction&quot; or a &quot;tasty dip&quot; for coins popular on here.</p>\n\n<p>Love them or hate them, meme coins are not gone and one of them, be it DOGE or something else, will re-enter the top 10 probably rather sooner than later - those coins tend to pump really hard once they do. Memes will be a big part of crypto ecosystem, at least until it matures - and hey, I wouldn&#39;t bet that it ever will. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short: DOGE is out of the top 10 for the first time since April. Enjoy it while it lasts, it probably will be back.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
