It&#39;s not early to say that the money will be flowing to alts, usually it flows to top caps. So if you&#39;re in these large and some mid cap coins, hold tight because things are about to get wild. BUT make sure you take some profits, now I know HODL is good because your coin may go up another 500% but try to take profits in stages. Securing profits is the best thing you can do to yourself in the alt season, at the same time letting the rest ride just in case things go wild. So sit tight and watch how things unfold in the next few weeks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
