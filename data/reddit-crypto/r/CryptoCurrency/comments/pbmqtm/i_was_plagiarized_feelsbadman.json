One thing I can’t understand is the scummy element that inevitably comes when there is some money to gain.  Rug  pulls,  shitcoins,  etc.  Now  plagarism  can  be  added  to  the  fray.  The other day I wrote an original article for <a href=\"/r/crytpocurrency\">r/crytpocurrency</a> reviewing and comparing various crypto debit card solution. It took me months of using these cards in order to write a well informed article to hopefully help everyone out!</p>\n\n<p>Here is my original work. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p89d3p/i_have_used_and_reviewed_every_major_crypto_debit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p89d3p/i_have_used_and_reviewed_every_major_crypto_debit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the article which was pointed out to me by a few members of the community.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joyfulbusinessblog.com/the-5-best-major-crypto-debit-cards-ranked/\">https://joyfulbusinessblog.com/the-5-best-major-crypto-debit-cards-ranked/</a></p>\n\n<p>Aside from some small changes, this is my words. I am not going to bash the person who published the article or plagarised my words. Even though it doesn’t feel great, I still stand by the words and hope that some people are helped with what I reviewed. </p>\n\n<p>The article was then shared all over the place. I‘ve seen it on multiple subreddits. It’s not the end of the world but it does feel bad when you work on something and someone else tries to claim what isn’t theirs.</p>\n\n<p>To everyone else: </p>\n\n<p>May you see nothing but green dildos and lambos!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
