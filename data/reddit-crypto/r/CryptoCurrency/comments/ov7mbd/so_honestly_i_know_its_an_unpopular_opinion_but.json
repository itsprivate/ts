But really, every single time BTC goes through a bull run it gets a bounce like this.

I am totally, 100% open to the possibility that I may be wrong to say that, as I am absolutely not an expert TA.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now if you want to downvote you&#39;re free to do it, just not too much please!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
