Your porto should look like this today with 58% loss.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fpvmkkyjxoi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=350b471e096ba7370c188a6cb6627b3ccc8b8b67\">https://preview.redd.it/fpvmkkyjxoi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=350b471e096ba7370c188a6cb6627b3ccc8b8b67</a></p>\n\n<p>what you should do now is to open the trade section of your exchange, select XRP/USDT(cuz its the best stablecoin out there) and click Sell button. after you sell it with current price(which was 1.25 when i made this), you should click on Buy button and rebuy XRP or any specific coin that you just sold in loss and VOILA! by doing so i now own 402 XRPs( cuz i had 2 usdts left in spot from previous remaining dust) and i am in almost in 0.5% profit. Not only you now have more XRPs but now you are comfortably sitting in green area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wt7se37lxoi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689bef6ebdfc71b5099618b00eada8fa49e11d60\">https://preview.redd.it/wt7se37lxoi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689bef6ebdfc71b5099618b00eada8fa49e11d60</a></p>\n\n<p>This technique works for every coin and every amount of loss at any given time.
