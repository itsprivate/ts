I can contribute the following to my \"interest\" in Crypto investing:\n\n-I gave up smoking cigarettes. I was spending close to $400 AUD a week on smoking.

Everyone says to only invest what you can afford but I had no definitive idea what I could afford. I sat down and extracted 12 months of bank statements into excel and from that data I developed a pretty comprehensive budget which ultimately told me how much I could afford to invest in Crypto.\n\n-After developing the budget with the goal of finding out how much I could invest into crypto I realised there were areas of my life where I was just bleeding fiat. I actually stopped investing in Crypto for a bit while I focused on paying down high interest 'negative' debt like credit cards and car loans. I vetted my utility and insurance providers and if they were unable to offer better prices I took my business to other companies. I negotiated with my bank and reduced the interest on my mortgage, I also changed my repayment schedule from monthly to weekly which significantly reduced the term of the loan. \n\n-I further offset my electricity bills with the installation of solar panels on my home. I haven't had to pay a bill in over 18 months.\n\n-Having reviewed and maxed out reduction on expenses and needless purchases I still wanted more money for my family and to invest in crypto so I decided to upskill and increase my income.

I now stress less and never worry about money. I'm a lot happier now, I spend more quality time with my kids and wife because I'm not worrying about how we are going to pay the next bill.\n\n-Indirectly Crypto saved my marriage, kept a roof over my families head and drove me to be a better person in general.",
