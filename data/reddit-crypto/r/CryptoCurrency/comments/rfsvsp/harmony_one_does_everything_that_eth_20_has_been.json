The total cost to do ALL of that was about &lt;strong&gt;.0000002 ONE&lt;/strong&gt;. This same set of transactions could have cost me upwards of $400 on Ethereum, and maybe significantly more depending on the day. On Harmony, it&amp;#39;s basically free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that ETH has first mover advantage, but there was a time  when Yahoo! was bigger than Amazon, Apple, and Google. How much longer are crypto developers and users (outside of whales) willing to tolerate triple digit gas fees when competition like this already exists? It can&amp;#39;t keep going for much longer imo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
