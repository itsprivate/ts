The coin you will mention without any context will just be written there within your comment and nobody will have a clue why you have put it there. The probability why you would put it there is that you have probably invested some of your hard earned money in it and want to convince others to buy into it in order to increase the price not knowing that the others commenting on your comment either have invested in that coin as well or simply have the same low buying power as you have. In fact it will leave your comment about your coin unanswered and it will slowly but quickly move forever into the void of irrelevance. With that said I‘d like to make a proposal. What if you would not put your coin into a contextless comment underneath this post but instead collect proper substancial information about the specific coin or project and present it in a good and digestable way to us, the users and commenting cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Wouldn‘t this deepen the conversation and foster a good and deep dialogue between us?</p>\n\n<p>Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
