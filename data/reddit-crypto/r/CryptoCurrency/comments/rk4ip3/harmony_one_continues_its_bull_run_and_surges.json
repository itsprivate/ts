This means lower fees and higher speeds on the network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has been quite a huge bull surge for Harmony since Thursday. This coin has already gone past multiple resistance levels since the latest Bitcoin crash as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else extremely bullish on Harmony ONE? Out of all the coins in the top 100, you&amp;#39;re most likely missing your chances with Harmony being one of those that are most likely to get into the top 30 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Fixed the percentage as an average across most coin trackers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
