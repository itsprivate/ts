Worry not, I am a sane individual and did DCA in but it is an amazing feeling to see I am finally back where I started. After the experience, my first fall and soldiering through I have come to an understanding of why people absolutely love the bear and the dips. Thinking back, I struck luck to be able to buy some BTC at 28K, 30K and 35K. No one knows if we will be able to see BTC at that price again but I for one am remarkably content to have bought them at that price when we are finally closing in 64K BTC. </p>\n\n<p>For those of you who held like me kudos to you and thanks for HODLing together that made it a lot easier. </p>\n\n<p>Crypto is definitely a great place for an adrenaline junkie like moi.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
