Luckily now its about 5% which is more in line with what's recommended for such a risky investment.\"\n\n\n\n- [CryptoNick is deleting all of his BitConnect videos, and so are his buddies. Please never forget what he and his cohorts did to so many people, and how much money those people lost in the process thanks to CryptoNick, Trevon James, and Craig Grant!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r0ftz/cryptonick_is_deleting_all_of_his_bitconnect/) SafeMoon's older brother?\n\n\n\n\n- [+1(800)273-8255 - U.S. National Suicide Hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qu8t9/18002738255_us_national_suicide_hotline/) Things got rough.\n\n\n\n- [Why we won't have a long term bear market, and how to systematically pick your future investments in crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r4vlc/why_we_wont_have_a_long_term_bear_market_and_how/) Huge post and the title sums it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that's all I am going to do for now, so far I can say that for myself it was a nice excersise to do, and what I get the most is how their posts are so similar to ours right now, I don't know if we are at bear market now, or how long we will be, but the paralellisms for good and bad are there, and as you can see if you were guided at least by what people then were getting to the front page then you certainly had now idea what was going to happen, just like us right now. \n\n\n\n\nAlso I would love to hear people that were here when that bear market happened, I am new to crypto, only got 4 months as an investor so I don't have much insights about what It felt like.\n\n\n\nEdit: /u/thijsfc pointed out XRB is now Nano, which is doing quite well lately.",
