This is an incredible achievement for Ethereum. Depending on the price of ETH, this $ number could decrease back under 1 Billion, or even rise higher.</p>\n\n<p>The London Fork, which introduced the burn, was released under 6 weeks ago.  If traffic continues as it does and gas fees continue to climb, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if within a month another $1 Billion is burnt. Bullish.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
