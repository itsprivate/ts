The average cost of a home in America is about $245,000, according to Zillow. In some areas that number can double easily if not more. That&#39;s a lot of money. Can I afford it with my job? Not even in 30 years. And I&#39;ll lose this job way before that.</p>\n\n<p>And then boomers wonder why we are financially screwed. They think we are &quot;lazy&quot;. And keep telling us to work harder so that we can achieve better status or buy things we need. Many of the older generation people laugh at me when I mention that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum are a great way to invest money and one day maybe afford to buy a home with it. They dismiss it as a joke. They call it &quot;computer money&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot;. I&#39;m being told that I should work harder even though I work 10 hours a day and am a father of two little kids who need me.</p>\n\n<p>For me personally, crypto must not fail. It&#39;s the only thing that I still have hope that it&#39;ll pull me out of brain numbing grinding everyday. I want to say that I have other ways of saving money but I dont. Am I a fool? Chances are extremely high. But Im riding this wave.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Millennial on my bros and sisters, we&#39;ll get there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
