In their world it&#39;s a token CONSOLIDATION. So, if you had 1 billion tokens you will now have 1 million tokens but instead of 0.0000001 they will be worth 0.0001. </p>\n\n<p>The reason that&#39;s so brilliantly greasily effective for them is that they can keep selling their bags and run the price down again from 0.0001 till it again adds a few more zeros. Rinse and Repeat. </p>\n\n<p>Even though the price per token is close to worthless right now, when you&#39;re talking someone who has trillions, even a fraction of a penny can net you good sales proceeds when you dump. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr; SafeMoon team doing a reverse split to continue dumping without ppl noticing their coins going down massively in value</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
