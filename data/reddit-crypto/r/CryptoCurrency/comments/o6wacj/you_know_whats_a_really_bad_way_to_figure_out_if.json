That&#39;s stupid.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hi, I&#39;m martins by name hkreli. I am a regular poster on here and for some reason, sometimes my posts get a lot of upvotes. Currently, 2 of the top 5 posts on this sub in the past week were written by me, one slightly over, one slightly under 10,000 upvotes - and I have absolutely no idea why, neither of them were all that interesting to be honest.</p>\n\n<p>Did you ever have a post reach 5 digits of upvotes, or something close to that? If not, I&#39;ll tell you what happens: you get a lot of chat requests, especially if it happens multiple times. People were telling me random stuff, offering me money to promote their shitcoins or other products (because it seems you&#39;re an influencer if you have a few popular posts) etc. Stuff like that always happens (but yeah, it&#39;s weird enough).</p>\n\n<p>You know what&#39;s also weird? Part of the title of my popular post yesterday was &quot;Nobody knows what is happening, don&#39;t come to this sub for advice&quot;. I explictly said that nobody has a clue what will happen and that people shouldn&#39;t listen to anyone pretending they do, because crypto is super random. Can you already guess what messages I also got? Let me quote:</p>\n\n<p>Guy 1: &quot;Hello mate Do you trade crypto? Hope you don&#39;t mind sharing your strategy?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Guy 2: &quot;You seems to be probably one of the most intelligent and thought out people on all the trading subs, just wondering how you learnt the ins and outs.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Guy 3: &quot;Hey man looks like youre good with crypto can you tell me what to buy right now?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In my post I had, like I said, explicitly said that you shouldn&#39;t listen to advice - and I had given zero indication whether I was good with crypto. As far as those guys know I could just have 5 DOGE on Robinhood and nothing else. This is not the first time this happens, I always get asked for advice when I make a popular post, but I thought it was especially weird when the post was exactly about not doing that.</p>\n\n<p>Karma is the worst possible indicator of crypto expertise. I am not an expert (<sup>and to be honest I think there is no such thing as a crypto expert, but that&#39;s a different topic</sup>) and I&#39;ve seen downright crazy people with much more karma than me. Even if they&#39;re sane: maybe they are funny, are really good at promoting their OnlyFans or just post a lot of questions to askreddit. Even if they earned all their karma on this sub, that doesn&#39;t make them an expert at all. Please don&#39;t listen to anyone&#39;s advice just because they have a lot of upvotes. And if you still think people have authority because of karma: I&#39;m like the most popular user on this sub in the past week so you have to listen to me: don&#39;t listen to people just because they have a lot of karma or moons or whatever.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
