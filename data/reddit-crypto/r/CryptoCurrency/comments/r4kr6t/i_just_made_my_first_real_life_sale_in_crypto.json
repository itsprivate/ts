Do you accept any other form of payment?</p>\n\n<p>-Sorry, what do you mean? (At the moment I was imagining some pretty weird things tbh)</p>\n\n<p>-Like Pay Pal, or Venmo? </p>\n\n<p>-Oh! right. Sorry, I don&#39;t have an account in either.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Pause...</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>-I could probably take Crypto...</p>\n\n<p>-Yeah that be cool, would XRP be fine? (Fastest transaction speed of the currencies available in the most popular crypto exchanges in Mexico)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I felt so exited! A real life transaction of physical goods for crypto currency! Just like the pizza guy! The transaction went fine and didn&#39;t take too long. Afterward  I put that shit into BTC and ETH and due to the recent spike I&#39;m already up like 6%!!! My mom said we should put a sign that says &quot;We accept Bitcoin&quot; lol. </p>\n\n<p>Do any of you have personal stories of transactions of the kind? I&#39;d love to hear them! </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>(I hope this isn&#39;t a breach of Rule 5.2. If it is, I Apologize and feel free to delete)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
