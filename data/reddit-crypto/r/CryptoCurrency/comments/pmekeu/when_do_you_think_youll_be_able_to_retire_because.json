Now if ETH goes to 10k and BTC to 100k around 2022, I think I&#39;ll be set. That&#39;s said I&#39;ve learned to tamp down my enthusiasm due to the wild swings we have. I also learned to stick with ETH and BTC mostly. I&#39;m really enthusiastic about them hitting 10k and 100k respectively. I&#39;m tempted to get into more tokens, or projects but I can&#39;t afford to gamble too much.</p>\n\n<p>That said, what investments do you have that&#39;s you think will alow you to retire, and how long before you think that may happen? I feel highly confident in ETH and BTC, so I&#39;m just trying to get a feel for people&#39;s confidence here on other projects. Not long shots, but what you think you&#39;ll retire because of. (Yes I know, it&#39;s all long shots but you know what I mean. Also this IS part of my DYOR.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
