I gotta admit, even though I know it doesn’t make a difference, I had a lot more fun buying 50 million Dogelon Mars coins for $120 (currently down 30% on that lmao) than I did buying 0.002 BTC for that same amount. Hell, you have to now spend over $6k just to get 0.1 BTC. I don’t see how anyone new to the space would not find that intimidating. However, for $120 you can get almost 200k Satoshis. For $6k you can get over 9.5 million. That seems very cheap to me still, and it would definitely be more appealing to someone who’s just now getting into crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
