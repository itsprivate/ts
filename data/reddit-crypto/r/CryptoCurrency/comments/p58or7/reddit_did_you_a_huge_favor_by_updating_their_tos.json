If there is no one authority backing up it&#39;s value, then it can&#39;t be regulated by SEC. </p>\n\n<p>In order for something to be regulated by SEC it needs a central figure to identity. This is why they aren&#39;t regulating Bitcoin.    There is no central figure giving it value.  There are countless people giving it value at their own free will. </p>\n\n<p>Reddit has no control over the Blockchain.\nIf people decided to give it value, reddit holds no responsibility for that as they have stated it has no monetary value.  There was no ICO.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not a security .  Over , done with, Period</p>\n\n<p>We should be thanking Reddit.  If they said it had value, and told you it can be traded then SEC would be regulating reddit right now or in the future.      That could mean NO MORE MOONS.    SEC would ruin the sub had they were forced to remove moons. </p>\n\n<p>So be grateful.   If you dumped off your moons I suggest getting them back before it&#39;s too late. </p>\n\n<p>Reddit has big plans for their Virtual goods sector.  It&#39;s a great app.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
