But the apps that also run on the network are interesting - seems like there is big potential there. It seems like a \"new internet' from reading it since it has something to do with being decentralized and running on nodes (I guess?), but at the same time I start to wonder if it's ACTUALLY different or if it's just marketing jargon. They describe it as a P2P thing (similar to torrents? I guess? is that accurate?) I just wonder how the network would scale if it suddenly sees a ton of adoption.\n\nThe website (and Ethereum shills) make it seem like this is the next big thing - their interest in moving to the staking model sounds like (if it works) that it could be great (though the potential downfalls could be a massive hit on Ethereum as a whole) - a huge reduction in energy usage is a +1 from me, seeing as how I work in the energy industry.\n\nAlso people always compare Bitcoin to it - I know Bitcoin is the \"mother\" of Crypto as we know it - but in general I feel like I either see mostly negative things about Bitcoin (aside from it's monetary value), or no talk about it's future plans are. Seems like more of a volatile \"stock\" than a currency with a big plan. Why are most eyes still on it? People always complain about the energy usage of Bitcoin and it's energy impact on the global grid. I know that there are a bunch of ETH network coins that make changes based on people who earn tokens from staking into it the coins? How does Bitcoin make changes (if at all), or was it basically deployed the the mysterious Satoshi and left to fend for itself.\n\nSorry for all the questions here - this stuff seems really interesting and I am most definitely excited to be a part of it all but it still feels really \"uncharted\". I think Reddit Moons may help to get more people interested in the network though.\n\nSo what do you think? Is Ethereum's network going to be the big thing? Lots of people think that way - wondering how others feel. I hardly see anything that paints a promising future for Bitcoin besides how much money it makes.",
