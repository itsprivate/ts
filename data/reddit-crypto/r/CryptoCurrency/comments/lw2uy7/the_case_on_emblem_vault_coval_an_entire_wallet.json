Portable Liquidity Pools ‚Äì Hold multiple liquidity pools inside a token (e.g. Balancer, Uniswap)\n* **Tradeable Portfolios** ‚Äì Trade entire portfolios in one transaction (i.e. ETF‚Äôs) Create Hedged Tokens ‚Äì Combine tokens inside an Emblem Vault to create a composite token.\n* **Digital Entertainment** ‚Äì Video, games, and music inside an NFT (anti-piracy).\n* **Tokenization** ‚Äì Tokenise real-world assets for supply tracking or trading.\n* **Blind Transactions** ‚Äì Send tokens to a Vault and hide contents within with a password, the vault can be traded many times but transactions will be hidden on-chain unless you have a password.\n* **Store Encrypted Data** ‚Äì Stored Value (e.g. gift cards), software keys, coupon code.\n\n# What are the Tokenomics?\n\n**$COVAL** is the utility token used for the purchase of products and services offered by the Circuits of Value ecosystem, it can be used for Emblem Vaults and future products. $FUEL is a utility token used within the Emblem Vault Platform for discounts. (Not to be confused with another $FUEL token, this one is still in development) The total supply of $**COVAL** is **2B** and the **circulating supply is around 1.2B.**\n\n# Staking Plans\n\nThey have some interesting plans lined up for the $**COVAL** token, one of which I can describe here.\n\nImagine if you will an **ERC20** token that allows you to **deposit** a token, and **earn** yield. When you spend your earned token, the equivalent of your deposited token will be burnt. You can later withdraw the remaining deposited token, keep your yield, but your balance of the earned token will be reduced by your withdrawal amount.\n\nThis system will allow **staking, and yield** **without** withdrawing your earnings, so **gasless** on mainnet. **Shadowstaking** is another term.\n\n# Why should I care about Emblem Vault?\n\nThe **entire** cryptocurrency space has taken the concept of ‚Äú**money**‚Äù from a very small set of possible currencies all controlled by centralized governments, to an **infinite** set of possible ways to exchange value.\n\nThe crypto space opens up **endless** **possibilities** for party-to-party exchange, almost like we have gone back in some ways to the days of bartering, where you could trade **bananas** for **chickens** and the act of building a barn for a horse (I might have been watching Little House on the Prairie recently ‚Ä¶)\n\nBut the problem with the barter space and the problem with the crypto space are the **same**: how do **2** parties **quickly and efficiently** negotiate how many bananas are worth a chicken, or how many hours of barn work are worth a horse, or how many chickens PLUS hours of barn work are worth a horse?\n\nAnd in the crypto space, how can I give someone a ‚Äú**composite**‚Äù token, meaning that I use some of my **BTC** and some of my **ETH** and some of my **Dai** and some of my **Tron** in a **single** transaction? Currently, you **CAN‚ÄôT.**\n\nIn the crypto space, there is **NO** elegant way to exchange coins and/or tokens across multiple blockchains in a single transaction.\n\nInstead, one has to **transfer** BTC and then **transfer** eth and then **transfer** dai and then **transfer** Tron (and do that to **4 different addresses**, and let's not even talk about **fees**). What the crypto space is lacking is a simple way to **combine** multiple coins and/tokens and exchange them as a singl**e ‚Äústore of value‚Äù.**\n\n**Enter $COVAL (Circuits of Value).**\n\nEmblem Vault is a product of the Coval sandbox, born of the Coval ideals that crypto should be universal; fully exchangeable across blockchains, coins, tokens, countries, everything. Using Emblem Vault, anyone, anywhere, can combine currencies across different blockchains into a single ‚Äústore of value‚Äù and then transact that ‚Äústore of value‚Äù **without ever moving the individual tokens** until they are **claimed** and are **ready to be spent at any moment.**\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n* Create a vault Put shizzle into it. This can be any combination of BTC, ether, any ERC20 token, AND any ERC721 token.\n* Send that whole combination of stuff as a single tx to anyone you want and however many times you want.\n* When the time is right, the current owner ‚Äúclaims‚Äù a vault, receiving the private keys for all included coin/token types, thus being able to import them into ANY crypto wallet and spend them.\n\nTry it for yourself. Go visit emblem.finance and create one.\n\n# Quick overview:\n\n**Current price:** $0.0068  \n**Market Cap**: $6.6 Million  \n**Where to invest:** Uniswap/STEX",
