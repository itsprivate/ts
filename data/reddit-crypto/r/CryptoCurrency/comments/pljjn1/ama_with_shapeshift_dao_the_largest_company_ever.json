It only felt right to hold it right here, where some of the crypto&#39;s earliest ideas were spread and evangelized.</p>\n\n<p>The ShapeShift team is nothing short of inspiring in creating a number of successful products for the crypto community. We humbly announce that ShapeShift co-founders Erik Voorhees (<a href=\"/u/evoorhees\">u/evoorhees</a>) and Jon ShapeShift (<a href=\"/u/shapeshiftjon\">u/shapeshiftjon</a>), as well as Willy Ogorzaly (<a href=\"/u/willyf0x\">u/willyf0x</a>) foundation head of decentralization and engineering leader Josh (<a href=\"/u/joshuaforman\">u/joshuaforman</a>) , whom have been fighting, innovating, educating, and shaping the blockchain industry for nearly a decade are joining us for an AMA!</p>\n\n<p>Not many people, especially those that are fairly new in this space, know about the extreme hardships, intense pressure, threats and persecution that the early pioneers endured to help shape the thriving crypto-space we see today. So feel free to ask away, whether it be historical or about our future 🙂</p>\n\n<p>Did we mention we have NFTs &amp; other freebies to give to this awesome community?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some references links:</strong></p>\n\n<p>ShapeShift’s decentralization announcement and details: <a href=\"https://shapeshift.com/shapeshift-decentralize-airdrop\">https://shapeshift.com/shapeshift-decentralize-airdrop</a></p>\n\n<p>Recent Coindesk feature: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/18/shapeshift-daos-and-the-future-of-work/\">https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/18/shapeshift-daos-and-the-future-of-work/</a></p>\n\n<p>Erik&#39;s detailed decentralization post:  <a href=\"https://erikvoorhees.medium.com/shapeshift-is-decentralizing-639bb4c82fc8\">https://erikvoorhees.medium.com/shapeshift-is-decentralizing-639bb4c82fc8</a></p>\n\n<p>And of course, a lot of good resources on the <a href=\"https://shapeshift.com\">official site</a> and an inner look at the DAO community in <a href=\"https://discord.gg/shapeshift\">Discord</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The AMA will officially begin at 1:00PM (Denver, Mountain Time) but the thread will be opening now for questions.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
