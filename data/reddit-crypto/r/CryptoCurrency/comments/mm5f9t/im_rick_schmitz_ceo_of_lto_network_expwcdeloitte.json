I can’t wait to tell you all the latest news and progress. Our ecosystem is growing; partners, projects and tech, there’s so much going on it’s hard for me not to get excited about it.

Next to that, the LTO team is focused on getting the Decentralized Identities (DIDs) structure up and running so that cross-chain partners like [Horizen](https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-lto-network-to-make-business-transactions-safer-and-more-efficient/), [Drep Foundation](https://drep-foundation.medium.com/drep-partners-with-lto-to-enable-defi-ecosystems-between-eu-and-asia-through-decentralized-c5970e00dcb5) and [Effect Network](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/partnerships/effect-network-lto-boosting-trust-using-decentralized-identities/) can start building upon to it. Speaking of which, one of our other partners, [Sphereon](https://sphereon.com/), recently announced their next LTO Network DID product in the making: the [MyCompanyWallet](https://sphereon.com/news-and-insights/sphereon-and-lto-create-mycompanywallet-app/) App.\n\nWe fully expect more and more exciting projects will notice our plans with the DIDs structure and how LTO Network will function as an oracle for DeFi through [Chainlink](https://blog.ltonetwork.com/chainlink-oracles-b2b-accreditation-ethereum/). Naturally, we're ready to give all of them the information they need to make it work.\n\nSo far the introduction! Feel free to submit your questions below and let’s make it a great AMA together.
