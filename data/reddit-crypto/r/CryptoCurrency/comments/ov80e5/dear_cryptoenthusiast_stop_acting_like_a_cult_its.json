Funnily enough some people in here want to keep Crypto anonymous while saying that Crypto can help with transparency in politics by tracking transactions. Like ... what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crypto is not perfect. Let people critizise it to make it better. Don&#39;t bully them out.</strong> You are giving Crypto a bad look and driving people away from it. You are making it so easy for anyone saying Crypto is bad. &quot;Why else would they react like that to valid criticism?&quot;. Just bring forth arguments. Call your representatives in a calm respectful manner and tell them what you think and give them arguments. <strong>Nobody ever made the world better by insulting and bullying people. Be better.</strong></p>\n\n<p>PS: It&#39;s not helping to delete this thread. It just kinda proves my point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
