I think that’s amazing and I hope others enjoy the beauty in that just by clicking a button we can help make someone else’s life a little better.\n\nI never thought I would be this kind of person. I’m not talking about the sharing the wealth aspect of being a socialist. I’ve always enjoyed spreading the love. I’m talking about turning into a radical who wants to change the world.
