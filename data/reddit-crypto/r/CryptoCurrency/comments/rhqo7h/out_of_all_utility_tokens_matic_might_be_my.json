And they keep working so hard on expanding and upgrading their ZK technology and influence in the market (the recently acquired Mir Protocol for $400M). And I personally think ZK is the future in this market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, the developers listen a lot to their user base and constantly make changes to the network based on users’ preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, they’re all over the market from NFTs to scalability to GameFi. Wherever you go you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love to see what some of you favorite utility tokens are :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
