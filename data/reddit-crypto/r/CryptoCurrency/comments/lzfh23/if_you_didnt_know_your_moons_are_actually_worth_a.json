I recently got a distribution of 100 moons and now I just realised that I can convert mine to nano, which is another coin I really, really like.\n\nSo you should just know that if you wanna, you can cash them out for nano at [https://moon.nano.trade/](https://moon.nano.trade/) and then if you really wanted to, send that to an exchange (since nano has no fees when moving) and sell that for fiat, essentially meaning that shitposting can buy you lunch. No seriously.\n\nYou can also hodl your moons too, which is a viable strategy because they might be worth a bit in some time too, but it's awesome to know that I can in fact cash out my moons for money anytime I want. I thought you guys might like to know this too, if you didn't already, I certainly didn't.\n\nFYI: You will lose a lil bit in fees so just be sure that you wanna do so",
