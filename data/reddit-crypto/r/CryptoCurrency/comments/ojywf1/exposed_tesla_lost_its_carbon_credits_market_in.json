This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla&#39;s shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn&#39;t enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kl5io232k4b71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd804647696cb66355c6f86813aebea7c3ffc2a5\">Bitcoin purchase made sure Tesla had a profitable Q1 2021</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bsqm2midk4b71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143bd79e7eab0c149b3741174b1889990e530ea5\">2020 was Tesla&#39;s first-ever net-positive year thanks to carbon credits sales</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nvqwgowhk4b71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a61238f0ecfc9d394c7c0fdd580ba178ba7b224c\">But that source of revenue is shrinking (May 6)</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Long-term play</strong> - The reason for Tesla&#39;s revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.</p>\n\n<p>So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?</p>\n\n<p><strong>One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments</strong> <em>&quot;due to</em> <em>rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions&quot;</em><strong>, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cv3iaqtcn4b71.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5965e5ed7a4dbfdf035ec32544bb09851ffe703a\"> Tesla applied for renewable credits, one day before Bitcoin mining FUD (May 12)</a></p>\n\n<p>Unlike carbon credits, which can only be sold to other carmakers, the EPA&#39;s renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry.</p>\n\n<p>Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining to replace Tesla&#39;s revenue loss from selling carbon credits.</p>\n\n<p>Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%).</p>\n\n<p>The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of <em>&quot;and transactions&quot;</em> because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think he cares to understand. Notice how he&#39;s trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they&#39;re loving it!</strong> <em>(credit iTruth84)</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vinrxqnfs4b71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fc10359461a17813cf6823719660cfe9f1780cb\">Billionaires get all the benefits of inflation.
