(For some reason, it was locked, I never found out why).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have three kids, M**, A** and E**. I bought them each $100 worth of cryptos of their choice and will give them the entire investment when they turn 18. I let them make their choices based on whatever reasons they wanted. All I did was show them the top 100 list from <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/\">coinmarketcap</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>These are their allocations and reasons for each decision:  </p>\n\n<p><strong>M** (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.</strong> He really loved the black diamond and thought the other two had nice aesthetic designs.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>A** (7 yrs old, girl): ETH, AAVE, CRV.</strong> She also loved the black diamond, the AAVE has her favourite colour and starts with the same letter as her first name, CRV has a pretty rainbow.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>E** (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.</strong> She loves unicorns and therefore, loves UNI. The ENJ logo has a very pretty E for her name. CAKE because she loves pancakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
