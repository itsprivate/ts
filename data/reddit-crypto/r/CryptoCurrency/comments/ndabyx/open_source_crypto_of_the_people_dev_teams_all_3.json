So, lets take a step back.\n\n1. Blockchain projects are known, and frankly valued, for their transparency.\n\nSo why are they working in secret?\n\n2. The project basically has 3 part time devs.\n\nHow do the supporters of this community think 3 part time devs, and I billionaire, are going to fix a coin that was made in two hours, as a joke?\n\nFor Reference Cardano, IOHK alone, has 99 full time devs, and 278 person team and have been working on the project since 2015 full time.\n\nI’m preaching to the choir to most of you, but I want you shibbys to read this too.\n\nI held some doge once. It was fun. But non doge people are not your enemy.\n\nThese billionaires messing with the market while secretly trying to push a joke coin, for his own gain, are.\n\nDon’t believe me, believe the founder of Doge.\n\nJackson Palmer said this Thursday\n\n**Reminder: Elon Musk is and always will be a self-absorbed grifter**\n\n[https://decrypt.co/70945/exclusive-dogecoin-developers-say-theyve-been-working-with-elon-musk-since-2019](https://decrypt.co/70945/exclusive-dogecoin-developers-say-theyve-been-working-with-elon-musk-since-2019)\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrossnicoll/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrossnicoll/)\n\n[https://iohk.io/en/team/#](https://iohk.io/en/team/#)",
