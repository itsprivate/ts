I hold DOT, LINK, MATIC and ALGO (my wife would not let me sell it, she said she likes the name). Recently heard about Loopring but seeing it go parabolic, I am holding my horses. FTM is another candidate I bought some while ago. This sub has suggested several coins in past that was actually profitable (ALGO and ADA included). </p>\n\n<p>Now, I am here out in the wild asking those random internet people to suggest some solid projects to invest (DCA actually) in during a bullrun.
