Ask enough questions and you will get banned.\n\nEarlier today i was told to purchase [Cook.Finance](https://cook.finance/), that is about to \"take off\" to the moon. I googled it and went to their website mainly to view the team. The entire team went to great schools and show great careers on linkedin. So i decided to google them to see if I could get any more information about them. You cant. They do not exist. After the second or third person bringing back nothing i decided to check and see if any of them had actually graduated from the University they claimed to have attended. None. Not a single person on this [Cook.Finance](https://cook.finance/) team had graduated from the University on their linkedin profile page. I assume they never attended because again they do not exist.\n\nThe next thing to do was to reverse image search their linkedin profile to see what social media website it came from. Guess what? The reverse image search for every single team member returned nothing. It did not even return the linkedin profile picture i was searching. This almost certainly means the profiles were created recently and the crawler has not gotten to it yet. Either that or its a massive coincidence that not a single person on the team has had the crawler hit them over many years and every single one of them used a picture that has never existed before on a social media website.\n\nThose first two things alone are pretty damning themselves but I wanted to see what people directly tied to this coin would say about that so i visited the telegram channel which is by far the most active \"community\" for this coin. I went in and told them that i had reverse searched the profile pictures and gotten zero hits and also that it appeared that not a single one of them had actually graduated from the university they had on their profiles.\n\nI WAS BANNED.\n\nThey banned me for asking those two questions. Someone responded to me \"let me check\" and a couple minutes after that i was banned. I can post the screen shots of the questions as well the account no longer able to access the channel.\n\nThis coin is 100% a pump and dump scam.\n\nEDIT: very minimal edit.  i noticed that a couple of the teams linkedin pictures return their profile link to linkedin.  However, there are still a number that do not return anything.  This does not change my view",
