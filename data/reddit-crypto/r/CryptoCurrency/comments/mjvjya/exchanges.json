Most of hate is from  people hating because Binance and Coinbase or whatever exchange you use happens to be somewhat like a centralized bank. \n\nHave you guys tried buying crypto back in the day?\n\nHave you guys forgotten how hard that was?\n\nDo you guys realize that you don’t NEED to keep crypto on an exchange?\n\nDo you not realize how easy investing in crypto is now as opposed to back in the day because of these exchanges? \n\nThese huge exchanges have allowed many naive investors and less tech savvy investors invest into t he cryptocurrency market like never before. I can appreciate that. Any investor can.\n\nIt’s not a perfect system, but it’s also a relatively NEW system. Banks have been around for a very long time. They’ve established trust in society. Crypto exchanges haven’t had that time to mature yet. Give this shit some time and appreciate the fact that crypto finally has multiple platforms to trade, stake, buy, sell or whatever as opposed to a couple of years ago.\n\nEdit: I’m not trying to say that exchanges like Coinbase or Binance are perfect. I just think people forget how far it took to get to where we’re at and don’t consider what these exchanges offer now that wasn’t ever possible before. \n\nThese exchanges may come and go. Maybe new platforms get created down the line. Crypto is still new and Rome wasn’t built in a day.\n\nEDIT 2: People seem to think I’m shilling Binance. I’m not shilling Binance. I’ve used and I use multiple exchanges. The point if this post is to acknowledge how far we’ve come while also taking into consideration that improvement amongst ALL platforms needs to be made. Yes, I use Binance for some transactions, but not all. If I replace that with Coinbase, are you guys going to tell me I’ll shilling Coinbase too?",
