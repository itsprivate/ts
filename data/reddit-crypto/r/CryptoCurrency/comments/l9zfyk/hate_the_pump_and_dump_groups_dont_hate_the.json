Folding@Home-  By folding at home you can \"Mine\" Banano by renting your GPU and CPU power to True Medical Research.\n\nwith a low value of each Banano coin you can truly have fun with it by accumulating some , giving away some or contribution to Medical Research,\n\n and that's the purpose of a Meme coin **in my opinion- Having fun.**\n\nPeople should understand that Investing Hefty amounts of money in meme coins isn't a wise choice!\n\nbut people can do whatever they want, if you decide to invest in something you should DYOR and take full responsibilities of the outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fight against the Pump and Dump Groups\n\n# \n\nBack to our Topic, Don't Hate the Coins that are being Pumped and Dumped, most of them probably being victimized by Pump and Dump groups.\n\n**Hate The Pump and Dump groups**, because these groups can move from Coin to Coin every single day and create chaos that isn't even connected to a certain coin.\n\nFor example many people in this sub like LTO, Fantom or more low Marketcap coins, heck this Pump and Dump groups are now targeting XRP so its not just Low Market Cap coins, lets think about XLM, Ada, VET and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow would you react if a Pump and Dump groups will decide to pump of your favorite coin?\n\nWould you turn your anger towards the Developers or the managers of that coin? \n\nYou Should turn that anger to that Pump and Dump groups that will bring chaos to a legit coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm asking you one thing don't turn your hate towards a certain coin, turn your anger against these groups, don't Join them, Downvotes their posts, report them to the admins and try to prevent people from joining these groups.\n\n# Only together we can stop it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks you for coming to my TED talk, feel free to leave your comments below and discuss it.",
