I know there&#39;s plenty of us out there.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a typical 30 year old guy. Some family, most of them are estranged. Single, no kids. I have a good friend or two I&#39;ve known for decades, one of them just got married, we barely see each other anymore.  You know how it goes.</p>\n\n<p>Lately I&#39;ve been struggling with what do with my life. I have a decent career in data analytics, but I didn&#39;t go to school for programming and constantly people belittle me in my industry for not understanding the fundamental concepts of SQL and just being a &quot;copycat&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, luckily I have the money for stupid fiat, and I found cryptocurrency a few months ago. This community has been so helpful and welcoming it&#39;s changed the game.</p>\n\n<p>That was right when BTC hit 29k. I bought, put my entire life savings in, and I&#39;m finally feeling like I have something to look forward to.  The idea of not having to work a job I hate, financial freedom, and becoming a life-time hodler is helping. I had around $20k saved to my name recently and was thinking about buying a house, but the idea of being the only one in it just seemed pointless?</p>\n\n<p>Now I have only around $2k to my name in fiat, but I feel more alive than ever. Seeing the charts go up and down, getting to know the ins and outs of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work protocols, reading white papers, being active in a community that believes in decentralized currency, some people might say I just love money but no, I love cryptocurrency.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
