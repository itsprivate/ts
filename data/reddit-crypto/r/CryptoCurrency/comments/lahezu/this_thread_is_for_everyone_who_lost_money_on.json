Show this to your friends who want to \"get rich overnight.\"**               \n\nThere are quite a few users who have spilt over in to our subreddit from wallstreetbets and the dogecoin sub and god knows where else. After seeing this not only happen with a coin that was designed as a MEME and nothing more and then happening with XRP, I feel like there is an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed.                 \n\n[please read this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kp6s43/inside_a_pumpanddump_group_the_deception_the_con/) on how a pump and dump group operates. If you don't have time, the TL;DR is - they buy tokens / coins anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the head of the group tells everyone to pump a coin. Then they dump their coins without telling you. They claim you get \"insider\" information if you give them 0.01 BTC or invite 30 people to the group.                  \n\n#**Pay attention to these fundamentals:**                \n1. It doesn't actually matter if there is a cryptocurrency that is more efficient, more secure, faster, or better in general because....               \n2. You will not see people who mined bitcoin for nearly free in 2010, or bought it at 10 cents each, 1 dollar each, 10 dollars each, 100 dollars each, or 1000 dollars each dumping at 34,000 USD for a token that almost no one has heard of. Even if such a thing existed, you couldn't get everyone to agree on when / how to dump their bitcoin for \"something better\", this was tried with bitcoin cash and the market has spoken.               \n3. Financial institutions aren't interested in anything except bitcoin right now (and are **much less interested in something the SEC has legal issues with**) because it functions as a hedge against inflation and it has verifiable scarcity.                 \n4. You need to pay attention to **market capitalization** (market cap for short) of a cryptocurrency. Go to coingecko.com. Check out the market cap of your \"coin\" and then compare it to bitcoin's marketcap. In order for it to surpass ethereum it needs to get 130 billion USD of fresh capital quickly. If it wants to get past bitcoin, it needs to get at least 600 billion USD of new capital. with that in mind...                 \n5. If your token is under 50 cents but it's in the top 100, do the math and figure out how / what it would need to get \"past bitcoin\". Just because it's \"cheaper than bitcoin\" doesn't mean everyone wants to buy it.                  \n\nHopefully this thread has been helpful. That is all. Thank you for reading.
