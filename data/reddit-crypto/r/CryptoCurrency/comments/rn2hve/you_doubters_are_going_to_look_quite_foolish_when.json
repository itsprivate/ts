Perhaps it will happen when the Grinch character in your life (A douche brother - in - law perhaps?) will say something dismissive like &amp;quot;You should never have wasted your time and money with something as foolish as crypto&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you will see the numbers start to shoot up. His eyes will go wider and wider as he realizes his mistake. (You giggling when it hits $69K won&amp;#39;t help any). When it finally hits $100K, his heart will grow 3 sizes that day and you will be vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happening is inevitable. The only chance of it not happening would be if our lives are not a work of fiction, and that seems very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
