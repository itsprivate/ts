We all love talking about our work and cool new investments and ways to spend our money on future vacations or sport equipment. My family is small so maybe we have less to worry about. But no one in my family tries to get loans, steal money, and would survive an audit. My interests, like crypto, would be an awesome topic for the dinner table. Debating on why or why not it’s the future. Debating on if it’s paid off investing in risky assets and whether it’s worth looking into. For real guys if you know your family well then don’t be afraid to talk about your interests and passion such as financial freedom and the technology in crypto. No need to talk about holdings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
