  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;XRP Ripple is slugging it out in court, they could have settled to the EVIL EMPIRE (THE USA) but they didn&amp;#39;t. They held their ground because the FEDs were being bullies and really haven&amp;#39;t established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ripple is a real-time macro settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable &amp;quot;secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.&amp;quot; The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it was evident in the trial that XRP told Ripple earlier (court document revealed) that they weren&amp;#39;t a security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am baffled why the judge has not thrown out this case. However, there are rumours that XRP might settle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details. XRP Ripple has signaled that they wil be hiring several hundreds of people. A JP Morgan report sent to investors earlier this month put XRP and the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the spotlight and concluded that a win would put the crypto asset on the road to mainstream adoption. More on that, here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coinbase, which was mentioned as a key player for XRP adoption, announced it will participate in the forum and will be represented by CEO Brian Armstrong and Lead Independent Director Fred Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ripple has successfully accelerated its global expansion this year despite fears that the lawsuit could cause hesitancy among institutional partners. Now it seems that the blockchain firm will be hiring a few hundreds in 2022 as they prepare the launch of the upcoming Liquidity Hub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the XRP Ledger has just had a “game-changer” upgrade that took a year to come into effect and it’s likely to strengthen its appeal. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz said it was “awesome news”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, where RIPPLE goes so goes the industry as they say.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
