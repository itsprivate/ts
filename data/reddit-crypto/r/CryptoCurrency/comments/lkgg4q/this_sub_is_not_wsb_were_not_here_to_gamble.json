This should not be a gold rush.\n\nLet me start by saying that yes, I too participated in the WSB saga, and while many of have come changing that crumb trail of HIGH GAINS and it was fun seeing the stock go 50-100% every day, that's not how crypto really works. \n\nCryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC...) is a volatile asset, that means that in can go BOTH WAYS it can get you gigantic gains OR stupidity big losses...\n\nYou may get discouraged because you bought at the top last night and are still on the red, but the truth is that crypto trends UPWARDS, look at any widely adopted coin's graph and you'll see it if you zoom out enough. Instead of buying high and sell low, HOLD, if you want to add to your capital when it dips, do so, but remember that you don't lose money until you sell. \n\nI think it's important to emphasize that getting some of 6our gains out is also a good strategy, because when it dips you don't lose so much. And if the coin you're into dips, you can use the your realized gains to buy MORE and when it rises you'll make even more gains. \n\nIf you want to be safest, invest in well regarded coins (like BTC, LTC and ETH) , not shitcoins that people shill so you pump it up for them. Oh and never invest more that you can afford to lose, I'd personally do 1-2% of my savings, because I like to have money to live with right now and that's all I can afford.  \n\nBTW, dont think crypto is a surefire way to invest, other methods are safer IMHO. Naturally this is not investment advise in any way.\n\n\nTL;DR Crypto is like a rollercoaster, not a rocket. \nPlease do not turn this sub into WSB.\n\nEdit: words.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks kind stranger!\n\nEdit 3: the fact that this post and my comments are getting downvoted speaks volumes about how people really want this sub to go crazy into pump culture. \n\nDownvote away if you must",
