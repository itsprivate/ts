However, that is only available in the US and I&#39;m in UK where you can get crypto.com cards (available in Europe/US too).</p>\n\n<p>There are different tiers of cards available but I&#39;m going to be talking about the jade green card because that&#39;s the one i have. 6 months in, i have earned about $500 in rewards without changing any spending habits, and that&#39;s not counting the price appreciation of my CRO tokens that i staked to get the card. Here&#39;s how:</p>\n\n<p>Spotify reimbursed in full each month = $12\nNetflix reimbursed in full each month = $13\n3% cashback on all purchases = approx $30\n10% p.a. staking rewards on locked CRO = $25</p>\n\n<p>All of the above is paid in CRO, which i then shovel into the crypto.com Defi wallet and lend it out for a yield of approx. 14% p.a.</p>\n\n<p>All of those rewards put together have been about $500 in the last 6 months, and as my defi wallet size increases that will only get better. Obviously I&#39;m at risk of CRO price fluctuating but you could trade out to a stablecoin or some other crypto if you really wanted to.</p>\n\n<p>The best rewards I&#39;ve ever had from a bank are air miles, and frankly I&#39;d much rather have about $1000 extra in my pocket each year in crypto. My long-term plan is to keep accumulating CRO in this manner and when the next face-melting bull market comes around, whether it&#39;s later this year or not for years to come, I&#39;ll have a nice stack of CRO which I&#39;ve earned through doing...absolutely nothing?!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
