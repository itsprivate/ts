It would greatly reduce fraud, potentially allowing the sites to give out much more. And one could even create such a site to serve a dual purpose. <strong>Imagine if I wanted to help the subreddit on Mesoamerica get more attention. Then I could create a faucet that gives a differential amount based on the number of upvotes you get inside of that subreddit, encouraging people to post good comments there.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Then again, it could also itself be pretty susceptible to fraud; I guess someone would have to try to see how well it can turn out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That dude lives way ahead of his time..</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
