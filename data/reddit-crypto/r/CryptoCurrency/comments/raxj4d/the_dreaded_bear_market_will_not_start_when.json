That shows how pessimistic the market already is and it is exactly the reason why a multi year bear market will probably not happen now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be much more worried when people start posting &amp;quot;should I leave my job and start trading?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I made 10x in one month, so I will be a billionaire in six&amp;quot; and so on. This will be the time when people who bought in extreme fear start dumping on the moon boys and the dreamers will scoop it all up and then realise that no one wants to buy now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
