People call ADA, ALGO and more as stablecoins or claim they are underperforming while they have been up more than double this year. We see BTC do a 100% in a few months and then with a small correction everybody goes pessimistic and loses hope. ETH is on all time high levels and some dare to say the hype is over or there is no bright future ahead of us. The whole market has risen absurdly and October is so fucking green while now we see a tiny correction and suddenly we start the question if we are in a bear market. Shitcoins do a 10x and people fomo hoping for 2x in a day and if that doesn&#39;t happen it&#39;s a failure. God most of the crypto &#39;&#39;investors&#39;&#39; have become so low quality it even makes me wonder if indeed serious projects will make it through. You should be happy about the crypto market the way it is. It&#39;s rising extremely fast and the adoption is huge. We are just heading to a dangerously distorted economic reality.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
