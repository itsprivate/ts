Mostly I just worked really hard to stay even...\n\nDon't get me wrong... I hit some big gains but then would slowly see much of it disappear through an inefficient process of chasing falling boulders up big hills. I was making money... *for the exchanges.*\n\nThen I would read this thread every day and whether it was full of panic, party or moons it would encourage me down the rabbit hole further.

It pays to just DYOR, buy 5-6 coins you see long term potential in... set some Stop Orders if you are super worried about protecting a big gain and leave it alone.
