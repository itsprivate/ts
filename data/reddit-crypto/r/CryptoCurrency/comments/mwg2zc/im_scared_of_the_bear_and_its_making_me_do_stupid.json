I hit some big gains but then would slowly see much of it disappear through an inefficient process of chasing falling boulders up big hills. I was making money... *for the exchanges.*\n\nThen I would read this thread every day and whether it was full of panic, party or moons it would encourage me down the rabbit hole further.
