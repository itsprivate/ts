Its similar to how yahoo questions is still a popular destination for students looking for answers to questions from years ago, people here need to remember to maintain a degree of honesty and integrity when it comes to answering individuals. Otherwise we end up creating a toxic ecosystem like DOGE forums and communities, where any little question starts to be seen as FUD.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to write a sob story about how I came across this sub a year back, I genuinely wish newcomers the best since cryptocurrency is always in need of new developers, supporters, and idea creators. And the only way that will happen is if we treat people the same as we always have and don&#39;t deny people knowledge due to suspicion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
