DCA isn&#39;t &quot;the only way&quot;. Neither is selling now and jumping back in when it drops another 30%. Nor is swing trading while it dips further and further. Or even HODLing.</p>\n\n<p>They all work. If you haven&#39;t invested more than you can lose, and you aren&#39;t an emotional investor, there are TONS of ways to profit from this dip. There are also tons of ways to hedge against a further dip.</p>\n\n<p>The more you keep telling people &quot;don&#39;t do x, do y&quot;, the stupider you look. But you keep telling people &quot;HODL&quot; and &quot;DCA&quot; because it&#39;s the only things you&#39;ve heard parroted to you.</p>\n\n<p>Stop giving investment advice and telling people there&#39;s only one way to go. Every tactic works if you aren&#39;t an idiot. The markets can still dip another 50% overnight. Fuck, crypto might not even exist in 5 years. There is no &quot;right way&quot;. There is only one wrong way, and that&#39;s selling or holding without a plan.</p>\n\n<p>Also, take the emotion out of your trades. All money in crypto should already be considered gone. If you aren&#39;t practising risk management and getting emotional, you&#39;ve already lost.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"/u/Wess-L\">u/Wess-L</a> also brings up a point I missed. Don&#39;t buy now just because retards spam &quot;BUY THE DIP&quot;. You could wake up tomorrow with an extra 40% dip and you&#39;ll just be sick with regret. Wait out for the V shape recovery and don&#39;t get greedy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
