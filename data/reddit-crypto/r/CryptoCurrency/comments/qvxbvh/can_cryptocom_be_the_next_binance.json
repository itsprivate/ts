So let&#39;s jump right in.</p>\n\n<h1>Fee structure</h1>\n\n<p>It&#39;s fee structure is relatively expensive right now compared to the other exchanges and I hope they would reduce it in the near future. The fees is between 0.04% to 0.4% for maker fees, 0.1% to 0.4% taker fees, 2.99% for credit card pruchases.</p>\n\n<h1>Currencies</h1>\n\n<p>There are over 150 or more currencies right now in their exchange and it is quite a nice amount compared to the other exchanges out there.</p>\n\n<h1>CRO Card</h1>\n\n<p>Their CRO card benefits are amazing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Midnight Blue </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is basically free and there is a 1% cashback. If I am not mistaken, this is the ordinary plastic card</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby steel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the 2% cashback. With a FREE spotify cashback</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Royal Indigo / Jade Green</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the 3% cashback. With FREE netflix and spotify cashback</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rose Gold / Icy White</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the 5% cashback. With FREE netflix, spotify, prime, and 10% expedia cashback. You also get an exclusive crypto.com private gift</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Obsidian</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Maximum perks of 8% cashback. You get basically everything and some private jet partnership. </p>\n\n<h1>Crypto Earn</h1>\n\n<p>Their Crypto earn is quite amazing. Their CRO have a 10% stake p.a. depending on the card tier that you have. Some other high stake rewards are USDC, DOT, MATIC.</p>\n\n<h1>Marketing</h1>\n\n<p>more than enough.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
