This fact is very relevant in the context of the recent market dip and the current recovery we see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume you bought a particular coin at the price of $100. If the market falls by 20 % you will be left with $80. The market starts recovering and your assets starts to grow but this time in order to have your initial investment it will need a 25 % rise to get back to $100. The price might fall with 20 % but it should jump by 25 % not by 20% to break even. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$100 - 20 %($20) = $80&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$80 + 20 %($16) = $96&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$80 + 25%($20) = $100&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy investing! Don&amp;#39;t buy high and sell low.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
