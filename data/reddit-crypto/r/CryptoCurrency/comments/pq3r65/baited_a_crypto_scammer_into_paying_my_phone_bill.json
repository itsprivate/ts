I wanted to clarify here that you should never give any personal info to a scammer. I gave them my phone number because the number has no links back to my identity, and I donâ€™t use it for 2FA on any accounts.</p>\n\n<p>In theory a smart scammer could use you phone number to gain access to your social media accounts and more. I had nothing to lose here with what I did, worst case scenario was this guy finding my social mediaâ€™s and posting my Reddit history or something lol. </p>\n\n<p>But just a warning to you scammers out there, you gotta do better. If something seems too good to be true it probably isðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>\n\n<p>Also this is funny and all, but it still gave me a guilty feeling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
