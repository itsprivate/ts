Decided I wanted to post a coin I’m very bullish on. \n\n- Harmony ONE is a blockchain-based platform, built to solve the riddle of delivering both scalability and decentralization at no expense of one another.\n- Right now it has 2 second finality, yes 2 SECONDS.\n- Its fees are extremely cheap, like practically fee when using it to do transactions. \n- The team behind Harmony are amazing too, I’m not gonna list their names and accomplishments because I want to focus on the coin right now, but definitely recommend looking them up! \n- Harmony’s MC is roughly 1.1B right now, price is .1233 at the moment. \n- Harmony has been partnering up with some big names and announcing new partnerships almost every week now. Some big names are Animoca, Quidd, SWFT, and so many more. \n\n- Staking, it’s 12% APY. Absolutely insane. \n- All in all the team and coin are doing great things, the only thing it lacks really is community. Harmony just needs more exposure and adoption in the crypto world. A lot of people are predicting $1-$1.50 during this Bull run. I’m not gonna put any prediction of mine, because I’m a long term holder and the staking alone is amazing. I hope everyone decides to do some DD on this coin! Definitely recommend at least adding to the watchlist!",
