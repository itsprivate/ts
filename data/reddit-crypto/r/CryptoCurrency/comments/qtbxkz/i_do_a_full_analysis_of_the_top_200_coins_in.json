Putting a bit of excel skills and data analytics into this mini analysis on a boring rainy Sunday. Quite interesting to see some lesser known coins back then have now well on the nice moves, but at the same time many coins have fallen into oblivion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Changes in relative rankings</strong></p>\n\n<p>A whooping 120 coins have now out of top 200. The trend is quite clear: almost all of the coins ranked on the second half (101st - 200th) are now out of top 200. Nevertheless, 41 out of 50 coins on top 50 back then are still on top 200 now.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n2t27137jgz71.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3586f78b65df1f3a1a004da9c624c64437607f01\">https://preview.redd.it/n2t27137jgz71.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3586f78b65df1f3a1a004da9c624c64437607f01</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Please do note that drop in ranking doesn&#39;t mean the market cap is going down. In some cases the market cap still go up. However, market cap goes up doesn&#39;t guarantee increase in coin price because of changes in circulating supply.</p>\n\n<p>Mildly interesting: the coin that ranked 200th back then is BUSD, is now ranked 19th. No change in value because it is a stablecoin but the market cap has increased by almost 800 times from $17M to $13.53B.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Top 20 now - the traditional and the new comers</strong></p>\n\n<p>A number of coins on top 20 now were not even launched in Jan-2020. They are: SOL, DOT, SHIB, AVAX, UNI. WBTC was newly launched back then with a very low market cap.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/drecswhajgz71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0548587a7db6e5b7d15426d11fcfaecd964f1f00\">https://preview.redd.it/drecswhajgz71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0548587a7db6e5b7d15426d11fcfaecd964f1f00</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>USDC, DOGE, LUNA, ALGO and BUSD were coming from outside of top 20 back then.</li>\n<li>In terms of ROI, it is actually LUNA that increased over 20,000%, followed by DOGE with 10,674%.</li>\n<li>Later during the year, SOL came into the market with only $0.78 per coin in April 2020. It has since then increased by 29,803%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Top 20 back then - where are they now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Only 1 coin of top 20 back then is now gone (999). Most are doing well from investment perspective.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t6v2a9eejgz71.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d4ca01613b03bc52f42d8ff6468b1aeb8e4f57\">https://preview.redd.it/t6v2a9eejgz71.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d4ca01613b03bc52f42d8ff6468b1aeb8e4f57</a></p>\n\n<p>Quite interesting to see diversification doesn&#39;t always work with crypto. The top 2 average returns is almost double that of the top 100 or top 200 portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Big gainers - the ones that gained over 10,000%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fancy some rags to riches stories? Here are the ones that rose over 10,000%. FANTOM and LUNA top the charts here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4w49cqxijgz71.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79efadfa5e0928ce4bcb14c5f75210c7ec581e84\">https://preview.redd.it/4w49cqxijgz71.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79efadfa5e0928ce4bcb14c5f75210c7ec581e84</a></p>\n\n<p>Please note these are only from Jan-2020. There are coins that gained big but weren&#39;t launched in Jan-2020 such as Solana or Shib.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The ones that go to zero or near zero</strong></p>\n\n<p>And now we talk about the other side of gambling. Various coins have lost over 90%. And if it lost 90%, which is $100 to $1, it will need to increase 9,900% just to get back to break even.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/s4sgr8xmjgz71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7542663202a610cc9b35e720d6bfa42fa8a79f2\">Some of these coins sound very obscure as well. They are now forgotten.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Summary of gains or losses</strong></p>\n\n<p>As noted above, the returns for top 200 coins if you spread investment equally would be around 1,200%. There were big gainers but also a lot of big losers.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/akb37c9rjgz71.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c57d6fd57aed844354bf454a97d507b4903da5\">https://preview.redd.it/akb37c9rjgz71.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c57d6fd57aed844354bf454a97d507b4903da5</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I source data from Coinmarketcap and price movement from yesterday may change a bit, but I don&#39;t think it will shift any rankings significantly.</li>\n<li>Care had been taken but I can&#39;t guarantee 100% accuracy.</li>\n<li>Let me know if you want something to be added or changed.</li>\n<li>No staking rewards or other passive income or transaction fees are taken into account. These vary a lot and hard to quantify accurately.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
