If I didn't sell them, in just 2 months now I would have so much money that I don't even want to check exactly how much because I would die of anger.\n\nI decided by myself, it's not anybody else fault, but please stop with these posts where you advice people to sell shitcoins because their price will collapse, because you can't predict the market.\n\nHonesty I don't like these coins, I learned a lot in these months and now I focused my money in different coins with better projects, I believe I'll get a revenue in the long run.\n\nBut never forget that nobody can predict the market. And most important, the market is not related to the project, it's related to the hype. If everyone is talking about doge, everyone wants doge, so the price will spike. You can have the best project ever but if nobody knows about it, nobody is interested, so the price won't grow.\n\nRight now the most recent post got 7,5k upvotes and it's another post saying that doge is a scam and nobody should buy or they'll lose their money.\nWhy? If you don't like it, don't buy it, you can also say that you don't like it, but please stop pretending that you can predict the market because you can't.\n\nMaybe doge will collapse in few days. Maybe it will reach 1$. You just can't know it. Personally I won't invest now in doge because I think it's already too high, but I won't call it a shitcoin and I won't tell anyone to sell.",
