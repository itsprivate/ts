I’m not sure about you but I’m down 15-30% across all my portfolios from ATH. The past week has been an absolute bloodbath. If someone really wants to buy a coin then just do it. Most coins are still down at least 15% from ATH. So don’t complain or worse yet wish that it would dip more. We get it, you’re a crypto savant and only buy when the green line crosses the red line on the 236 hour MA or whatever other tea leave reading TA you do. Thank you in advance for not doing this anymore and do us all a favor and just buy now.",
