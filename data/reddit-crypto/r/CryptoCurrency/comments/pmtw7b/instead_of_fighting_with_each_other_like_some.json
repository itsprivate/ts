ETH sub was full of ADA memes and FUD in recent days saying it can&#39;t do things the way it is supposed to (that was debunked straight away by the way). Concurrency issues with ADA were never a thing and most of the decentralised exchanges including Ergo and other exchanges already found solutions to the UTXO model. </p>\n\n<p>But the biggest feature that we should focus on in my opinion is interoperability:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>One of the main value propositions of Cardano since its inception has been interoperability. The vision for the future is to provide a decentralized data platform utilizing blockchain technology that is scalable to onboard large amounts of user data, sustainable to keep incentives aligned with a robust Cardano governance structure and offer efficient interoperability with other blockchains and legacy systems.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>To date, one of the biggest factors that the blockchain industry has been trying to address is the zero-sum mentality of many big industry players creating a need for a unifying industry theme.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As the blockchain industry matures, several blockchain projects will co-exist in a dynamic ecosystem to meet the specific demands of many types of applications and users. Existing legacy systems will also need to somehow be a part of the movement towards blockchain-based data infrastructure and an interoperable blockchain platform such as Cardano will be able to meet its needs as well.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s simple as that, different crypto projects can easily coexist, single coin maxists will remain on all sides wherever we want it or not but I think as a crypto community we should focus on working together instead of fighting with each other. Bridges that will connect communities will be built and we should help them do it for the better future of all crypto space.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, I hold ETH, SOL, ADA and ALGO.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
