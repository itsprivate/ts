Probably but aren&#39;t we all. I have the classic story just like everybody else. yesterday I was sitting back from my shift at work and saw the SHIB graph greening super high. At this point all I could see was +50% today and so I took the last of my USDC (Around $1500) and went all in on SHIB.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Should I have saved some for buying opportunities for my other coins like ADA and ETH? Yea but I didn&#39;t and the worst part is I knew it was gonna drop as soon as I bought it. My thought process is &quot;If I buy it, it&#39;ll instantly drop. Maybe I should pretend not to care about the graph and maybe it&#39;ll rise&quot;. I was wrong and you take this as lesson just like I will. I&#39;ll just add it to the other FOMOs pile.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
