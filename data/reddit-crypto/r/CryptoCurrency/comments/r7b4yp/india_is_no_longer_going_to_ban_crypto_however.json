All you gotta worry about is the dip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We Indians had to worry about the dip and the possibility of an outright ban. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wasn&amp;#39;t a firm believer of crypto, I&amp;#39;d have panic sold but I held out thinking our government cannot shut itself off like that. Look at the taxation opportunities! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway it seems our Indian crypto movement is getting noticed by the government and they&amp;#39;re finally deciding to regulate Cryptocurrency as Crypto &amp;quot;Assets&amp;quot; and not recognized as legal tender. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;#39;s a sigh of relief for us Indian folks. I&amp;#39;d rather pay some tax than become an outcast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now time to worry about the dip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/business/new-crypto-bill-private-cryptocurrency-to-be-regulated-not-banned-crypto-not-legal-currency-in-india-5-points-2634568\"&gt;https://www.ndtv.com/business/new-crypto-bill-private-cryptocurrency-to-be-regulated-not-banned-crypto-not-legal-currency-in-india-5-points-2634568&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
