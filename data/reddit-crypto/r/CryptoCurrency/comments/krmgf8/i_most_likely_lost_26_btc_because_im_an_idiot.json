First order of business is to make sure I have a backup of the private keys. Well, no problem, I already have encrypted backups of my private keys on two USB drives stored at separate locations.\n\nBefore wiping the disk, I plugged one of them into the computer to make sure the file was there as I made those copies about 1.5 years ago after the purchase of my 2.6 BTCs. All good. Sure, a Ledger is more convenient, but this works and I now don't have to get death threats after the Ledger address leak.\n\nNext up, erase the disk with MiniTool's Disk Wipe as I don't want anyone restoring the wallet. This computer will now be with me at work, while traveling and so on. Reinstalling the OS, feeling good. On to the new computer, installing things I need, restoring documents folder from backup, setting up firewall and antivirus... all good.\n\nFinally, ready to reinstall wallets for the coins I own.\n\nLet's start with BTC. To import the private key, I just have to decrypt the file from one of the two USB drives and, well... just import it. I install the OpenSSL client and type in the command:\n\nopenssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in btcprv -out btcprv.txt\n\nThe terminal now asks for ... the password. No problem, I have all my passwords in my password manager which I trust 100%. I go to my password manager to grab it and... IT'S NOT THERE. No mention of a BTC password anywhere to be found. I spend the next 30 mins rechecking and rechecking, but it's not there.\n\nI've spent the past week and a half going through all my remaining disk files and notes, the password is nowhere to be found. I'm 100% sure it was a strong auto-generated password from my password manager.\n\nSo why can't I find the password? My theory is this: After testing the password manager thoroughly during my search for an answer, I realized it has a serious weakness: you can create a password, then copy it, switch to another window and paste it. BUT IT'S NOT AUTO-SAVED. You have to click a Save button! Now, if you try to quit the password manager, it will tell you about unsaved data. But I think I might have had the manager open in the background for a long time and forgot about it, then inadvertently clicked \"Don't save\" on the next reboot.\n\nIt's my fault anyway, I should've checked that I was actually able to decrypt the files before wiping the disk... \n\nI have one more thing to do: see if a professional recovery company can restore the wallet file. As I used wipe software, I'm told the chances are essentially zero.\n\nApologies for the length of this post, but I needed to get it off my chest. FML.",
