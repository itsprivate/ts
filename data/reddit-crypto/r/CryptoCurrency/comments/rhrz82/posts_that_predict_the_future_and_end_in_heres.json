Yeah, here&amp;#39;s a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fed announces they will begin curbing inflation, which should incentivize people to take a little bit away from their assets, but NOPE. All markets green today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big partnership announced with a particular project? Not even a blip in price action. Celebrity endorses a coin? 20% spike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OMG coin is still around? Like, why?&lt;br/&gt;\nSo here&amp;#39;s my advice - DCA and hold in projects you believe in, and don&amp;#39;t sell until you need the money for something. Keep a small stash of fiat in the event of another black swan event so you can buy buy buy. Please join me in downvoting all posts that end with &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s why&amp;quot; including this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
