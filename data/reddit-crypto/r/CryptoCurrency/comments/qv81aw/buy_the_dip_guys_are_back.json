This is not some great opportunity to buy coins at a small price. \nThe prices are at the levels they were like 10 days ago. Where were you then? Why didn&#39;t you buy at that price? You must one of those idiots that get fooled by Black Friday every year where they pump the price the week before and then they give you a &quot;discount of a lifetime&quot; by selling you a product at the price it was the whole year. Just buy whatever the fuck you want, at whatever price you want but STFU about it. </p>\n\n<p>Rant over.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
