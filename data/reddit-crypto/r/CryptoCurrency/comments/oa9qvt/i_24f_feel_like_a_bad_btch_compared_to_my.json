His strategy was to put a few thousand in and watch the charts meticulously every few seconds. I even saw him swing trading and swapping coins, so I decided to learn everything I could about crypto and see if he was getting &quot;scammed.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I learned a lot. I convinced him to not buy tether, watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, and saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN CASH and I tried to hold my breath. </p>\n\n<p>At this point (around April) I thought, hey, I know a little bit now, time to start my portfolio. I did something different than him, and put 25 dollars in each week. He kind of made a little fun of me, said it was &quot;cute&quot; that I was investing and trying, and also said it was kinda pointless to put that little amount of money in. </p>\n\n<p>Then came the &quot;crash&quot; that I was completely prepared for and mentally ready to see, and I just ... continued to put in my money weekly. He &quot;no longer wanted to talk crypto as much&quot; and stopped putting in money because all of his was already invested. </p>\n\n<p>I am proud to say that as of today (because I started building with one coin vs. His 10-15) ...</p>\n\n<p>MY BITCOIN IS WORTH MORE THAN HIS!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: for you weirdos saying I&#39;m in a toxic relationship .... have a drink</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
