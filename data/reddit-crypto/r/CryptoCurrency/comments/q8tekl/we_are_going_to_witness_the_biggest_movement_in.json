Easy, BTC can hold its own and then some and is proven time and time again.  This is how mainstream adoption continues and crypto in general becomes more widely accepted.  I keep seeing crypto.com advertising for UFC, college football, car racing, it&#39;s everywhere!</p>\n\n<p>More and more businesses will adopt and encourage crypto.

We will hit a new ATH tonight!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
