Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don&#39;t get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a> is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
