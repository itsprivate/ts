The numbers are inflated, but when this gets resolved people will know exactly how much crypto you have and maybe take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice, have fun with this bug while it lasts, but keep it private and keep your holdings private to avoid any unwanted attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
