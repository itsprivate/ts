But today Bitcoin moved into a descending pentagon pattern, currently testing 35k to the upper falsetto Trend Line of 37k. This indicates Bitcoin could possibly range back downwards to 30k if the Phase 3 Burgandy Trend Line isn’t held in the 24-hour period. </p>\n\n<p>If we <em>do</em> hold the Burgandy trend line, we could rocket past the 37k mark and overcome the asymmetric volatility, just like we saw at the end of last cycle’s oscillating Morningstone quadrant phase. </p>\n\n<p>In short: it’s quickly approaching Truth Time™️ for Bitcoin. If we can’t hold the Burgandy line, I see a re-test of the 21-day SVP directional level. But if we <em>can</em> hold the Burgandy line, and if Bitcoin blasts through the Tamland 27-week support metric, the upward pressure could lead to a downward stochastic indication of a Rainbow Cross. If that happens, all bets are off.</p>\n\n<p>Please subscribe to my shocked-face-thumbnail YouTube channel for more insight and analysis.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
