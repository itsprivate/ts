Why I think this is starting to get dangerous is because of everyone displaying the amount of moons they have. Some people on here are displaying that they have 100s of thousands of moons. I saw someone today with 500k moons at the peak that was $190,000. </p>\n\n<p>All I’m saying is people can now become targets and that’s scary. We don’t walk around displaying what’s in our bank accounts or what we have in our wallets I feel like it should be the same for moons since it’s becoming high in value. What does everyone think? I’m just trying to look after the well being of everyone. Cheers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
