Trading shitcoins is as risky as it gets.  <strong>Nobody</strong> here likes shitcoins. The people who love them are the ones that will buy the coin as soon as it launches and get out as soon as they can. People who are telling you to HODL are probably the ones that are too deep in it to sell at loss. They want you to stay so they can get out.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Holding shitcoin for a long term will most likely result in a loss of money -</strong> <strong><em>Losing money made me wiser</em></strong><em>, take this seriously even if I am not your</em> <strong><em>financial advisor.</em></strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
