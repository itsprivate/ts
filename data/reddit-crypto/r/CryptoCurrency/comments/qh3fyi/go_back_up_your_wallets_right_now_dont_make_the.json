No idea, considering I&#39;d been using the same password all day.</p>\n\n<p>I reached out to Guarda support. They do not curate an account, they just basically hold your wallets. This means that you have to save your wallet string manually. Now, my funds (8279 ONE) are lost and I have to start all over again. </p>\n\n<p>I failed so y&#39;all can laugh and back your seed phrases and wallets up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
