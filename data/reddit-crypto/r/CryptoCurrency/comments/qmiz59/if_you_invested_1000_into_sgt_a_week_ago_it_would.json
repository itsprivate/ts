But the gamble those holders took <strong>then</strong> is way underestimated <strong>today</strong> now that everyone knows of it. </p>\n\n<p>The dozens of other coins that fucked people hard — don’t make for as good of a one year equation. I took the liberty of going through the <strong>most popular</strong> moonshots posts from a year ago.. to bring you some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>BEYOND PROTOCOL - “bigger than Bitcoin and ETH combined” is the slogan and it was the most popular post in the last year, $1000 a year ago would be worth $647 today </p></li>\n<li><p>BabyKrypto - only 47 days old but if you bought $1000 worth when they started advertising it on Moonshots, you’d have $125 today </p></li>\n<li><p>$1000 in SHIBAFEVER would have gotten you 77 million coins just a week ago, worth $153 today </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After this we started getting into rebase tokens where the “price” doesn’t move they just “adjust” the tokens that you hold, but you can’t sell either so I’d say $1000 into those burned up pretty quickly. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There’s also Floki Jr, Floki New York, Micro Shiba and Chopper Inu, Catch Doge, Doge back, and Robo Doge that I can’t even find accurate information on.. but I’m guessing those didn’t make many crypto millionaires. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyway, I’m seeing a lot of posts asking how to jump on a newly listed coin first and where to find them, and I just wanted to say .. I don’t even think those that have held SHIB for a year give themselves enough credit for how big a leap they took. This style of investing breeds a lot more losers than winners, and winners rarely stop there and cash out — they’re on the hunt for the next opportunity to lose money. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do whatever makes you happy — but I think we need to see more of the whole picture</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
