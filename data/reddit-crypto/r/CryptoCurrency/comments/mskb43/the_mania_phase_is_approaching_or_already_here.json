Please try to be AT LEAST playing with house money (aka. withdraw initial investment), doesn't have to be right now but definitely before the market turns. When is that? That's the question that if I could answer I would already be a millionaire, so sorry, you'll have to figure it out yourself. DYOR is a motto for a reason.\n2. Be nice in this sub please: I enjoy being here, and would prefer not to have fights all over the place, if you think the DOGE pump was bad, see what happens in a few months, weirder things have pumped harder during bull markets (look up TRON in the last bull market) , so it's honestly not even an issue. If they bought into a pump and dump, it's their responsibility to figure it out before the dump. You can warn them, but no more than that, it's their money and they can do whatever they want with it. For those who's favorite coin everyone hates pumped, don't go around telling people they're just jealous. Remember, anyone here who bought bitcoin is up at least several hundreds of percent, and this idea that they'd be jealous is very immature, and will probably make them hate your coin even more. As many atheists say, \"I don't hate Jesus Christ, I hate his fan club.\"\n3. Congratulations to everyone on your gains! Hopefully in a year I will hear of all the great stories of how you changed your life with the money!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Nothing here so far didn't happen last time (perhaps arguably even every time), please be nice and if possible withdraw your initial money before the bear market. Congratulations and hope in a year you are wealthier than you are today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This is not financial advice please don't sue me ><",
