The congregation is in the hundreds. Anyone else seen something like this? I think it’s pretty amazing  to see different parts of our culture grasp the power of cryptocurrency. Can’t wait to see where this all heads. Adoption is right around the corner, from institutions to your local church. Now we just need the Bible uploaded on the blockchain haha.. I wouldn’t be surprised if more and more religious institutions hop on the crypto bandwagon. I think I read somewhere that the Mormon church was dabbling.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: not saying I am partaking in this, just reporting on the news. Also, if you don’t believe in God or go to church that’s all cool too! It’s more just exciting to see that crypto is available to be used in and for other things.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
