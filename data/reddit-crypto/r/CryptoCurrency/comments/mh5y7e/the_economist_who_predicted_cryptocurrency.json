It was considered the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s. Once again, the government’s monopoly on currency was questioned. On 3 January 2009, the first bitcoin was mined.\n\nIt was Hayek’s theory made practical.\n\nHayek’s theory in his book was that not only would the currency monopoly be taken away from the government, but that the monopoly on currency itself should end with multiple alternative currencies competing for acceptance by consumers.

I know, that some of you don’t like, when we are sharing the quotes from the history figures because they said a good chunk of things that was false. In this case, I feel like, the vision that Mr.Hayek had, is becoming true, and everyday we’re closer to it. \n\nHope you found this “legacy” somehow educating or inspiring.\n\nR.I.P Mr.Hayek - your vision is becoming reality :)\n\nHave a nice day !
