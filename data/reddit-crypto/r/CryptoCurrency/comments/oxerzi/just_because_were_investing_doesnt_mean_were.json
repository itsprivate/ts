Were all going to make money but unfortunately you have to have money already to make those huge bags. Even if ethereum were to hit 5k or 10k by the end of this year, if you only invested $100-200 you won&#39;t be seeing a lambo or even a new car. It makes me sad but its the kinda truth when people say you have to have money to make money. Regardless I&#39;m still going to keep investing and whatver i make im still going to make be happy about.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
