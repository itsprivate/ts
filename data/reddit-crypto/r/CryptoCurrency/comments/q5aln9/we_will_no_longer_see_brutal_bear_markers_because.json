However, I really can&#39;t see BTC being sold below 5 digits anymore. Nor do I see ETH being sold at 3 digits. It&#39;s simply too much of a discount. Way too many people are familiar with Crypto nowadays. You have thousands of institutions and companies investing in Crypto. You didn&#39;t have this just 2 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the explosive growth we&#39;ve seen just this year alone makes me believe that Crypto can no longer be stopped no matter how much FUD is being spread around. Bear markets are also becoming less longer and less and less profound.  We’ve had two down 83% bear markets, but  The previous two have been -61% and -54%. With the -54% being just a few months ago and we&#39;re already on a new bull market. </p>\n\n<p>The Crypto market just a few months ago crashed -54% because of an Elon tweet and crashed -30% again after a China FUD in June. Since then we&#39;ve brushed off dozens of these tweets and actually spurred a bull run after the latest China FUD. I seriously believe 2021 has begun a new chapter for Crypto. We are not only seeing longer and more bull markets but shorter and fewer bear markets in between. Crypto is a huge multi-trillion dollar industry now. I truly believe long and brutal bear markets are now a thing of the past.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
