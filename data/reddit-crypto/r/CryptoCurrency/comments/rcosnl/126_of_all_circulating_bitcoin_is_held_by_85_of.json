(proportionately speaking) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most shocking figure for me was that the majority of people- close to 85% of the total wallet address who holds BTC- holds less than 1BTC in their account while only 0.04% of the total wallet addresses holds more than 100 BTC each accounting to the collective ownership of close to 63% circulating bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought that Bitcoin was a means to erase this rampant and corrupt inequality, alas, as reference to the real world- the rich will grow richer and richer by each passing day. The freedom to invest a huge sum and let that sum grow is a luxury not all of us can have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1- I love Bitcoin, i love the technology, what i don&amp;#39;t love is this inequality in the ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2- Central exchanges holding Bitcoin: Can we approximate the number of Bitcoin held by central exchange and then assume that a large chunk of it is held by small retail players because players with significant numbers of Bitcoin would migrate to their personal wallet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maximum amount held by exchange should not be more than 10-12% (according to a dated article published this year) so if we reduce that from the current number 63%, 50% is still held by 0.04% and that still is a significant amount? Does this argument hold?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
