I'm not naming them because honestly, it doesn't matter. I swung by cryptomoonshots, told myself I was gonna put $50 on the first one I saw, and started the process through pancakeswap. I didn't read it all too well, but I did find the link easily for a currency called \"moonys\". The process finished, and to my surprise, the coins that entered my wallet had no value to them. Thinking this may have been an error of some sort, I turned off my phone for an hour. When I came back, still no value. I tried finding the reddit post and to my complete and utter shock...... it had been deleted. So I'm the proud owner of useless coins and it only cost me $50. (keep in mind this money isn't going to hurt me at all, and is purely for entertainment purposes) so please remember to do your research, stay away from cryptomoonshots, and never believe anything you read on reddit.....unless it's from me. Because I'm trustworthy. And stupid. Thank you for your time.",
