I saw this with SOL quite a bit. The reality is that centralized crypto is horrible and it defeats the entire reason why crypto is so great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized crypto is somewhere between decentralized crypto and the traditional system, but it is the worst of both worlds. &lt;strong&gt;Centralized crypto is not immutable (transactions can be reversed, look at ETC), it&amp;#39;s not trustless and it&amp;#39;s not censorship resistant&lt;/strong&gt; which are the most important benefits of a decentralized blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A centralized blockchain defeats the entire benefit of blockchain itself, which is decentralization. There is no point in using a centralized blockchain, a SQL server would work a lot better. I fully expect to be downvoted and have people in the comments attacking me for this, but the reality is that centralization is horrible and should never be justified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may make some money on a centralized coin, which is great! All the more power to you. But don&amp;#39;t pretend that it&amp;#39;s okay for the long term. Centralization is antithetical to all the crypto stands for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
