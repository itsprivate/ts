Memecoins like Doge,  and the rally of the GME stock were leading the way. The FOMO was real.  Unfortunately, this is what also led to a large portion of the drop and  the subsequent massive dip. Since the hype was never going to be  maintained, there was little else propping up the values.</p>\n\n<p>Since  then however, a number of projects, particularly Bitcoin specific, have  promoted more viable long term investment and adoption. Some examples  include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first Bitcoin Futures ETF just started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</li>\n<li>Grayscale is planning to convert their US$39 billion fund into a physical ETF.</li>\n<li>Bitcoin is now the 8th most valuable asset on the planet.</li>\n<li>Google announced a Bitcoin payments option</li>\n<li>Twitter is using the Lightning Network </li>\n<li>An actual country adopted Bitcoin as its national currency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This time, it is much more than just hype driving the rise and use of Bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
