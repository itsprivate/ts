You can far more than that weekly, but this 15 XTM is what you have direct control over. </p>\n\n<p>The other ways to earn more are things that you can&#39;t control, like how many people follow you each week. Those I have excluded from the maths.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Noise .Cash</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is another social media platform that rewards you with BCH for your social media posts. </p>\n\n<p>The key to earning anything tangible here is to publish original, useful, and interesting content on any topic that you love. Some of us earn between $1 to $10 daily for making noise on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brave browser</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This one is very popular among us, but in case you don&#39;t know, you can earn the Basic Attention Token (BAT) by using the Brave Browser and opting to see its privacy-respecting Ads. </p>\n\n<p>The company shares a portion of the Ads revenue it receives from advertisers with users like you who choose to see the Ads. How much you earn with Brave monthly depends on the number of Ads you receive and probably your location.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Presearch</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Presearch is a decentralized, privacy-first search engine that currently rewards you with 0.1 PRE for every search you perform, up to a maximum of 30 paid searches per day.</p>\n\n<p>You will earn a maximum of 3 PRE per day or 90 PRE per month with Preearch, which at the current price is worth $21+ for doing what you already do every day anyway.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blogging platforms</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are a good content creator, you can earn crypto daily for your work by publishing on the following crypto-based blogging platforms: Publish0x, ReadCash, Hive, Blurt, etc. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn and Earn programs</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Coinbase and CoinMarketCap learn and earn programs are the most popular in this category. CakeDeFi and Crypto .Com also recently started their own learn and earn programs. </p>\n\n<p>They reward you with various tokens for learning about selected cryptocurrency projects. You&#39;re literarily being paid to learn about various crypto projects. This can only happen in crypto. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Airdrops and giveaways</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not underrate a crypto airdrop or giveaways, because some of them are worth a lot. Plus the value of the crypto you receive in these airdrops and giveaways can increase significantly over time.</p>\n\n<p>So whenever you have an opportunity to participate in a crypto airdrop or giveaway, as long as they do not require you to send money, and you meet the requirements, I suggest you take part in them. </p>\n\n<p>For the past 2 years, I have personally earned tens of thousands of dollars worth of crypto from airdrops and giveaways.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people are asking, where do they find airdrops to participate in.</p>\n\n<p>Good airdrops are getting rarer, but they&#39;re not impossible to find. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes they&#39;re based on luck, chance, being at the right place at the right time, and some old hunting.</p>\n\n<p>CoinMartketCap airdrops are the only ones I can recommend right now, and I suggest you stay active on crypto social media platforms for those random airdrops and giveaways hosted by various projects.</p>\n\n<p>Pls if you have some good, legit airdrop sources, kindly share in the comments. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>These are just a few of the most legit and worthwhile ways I know that you can earn crypto daily. </p>\n\n<p>And if you can HODL what you earn from these platforms they could be worth some really significant amount over time.</p>\n\n<p>Now over to you, what are the best ways and platforms you use to earn &#39;free&#39; crypto daily?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
