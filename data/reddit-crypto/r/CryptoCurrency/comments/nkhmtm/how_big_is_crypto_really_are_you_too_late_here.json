We are still very early. It’s less than 1% of total currency and markets. That’s still 100x opportunity to grow from an overall perspective. We’re only in the IBM days of where crypto currency can be at when you think of how the computer and internet exploded. So no, it’s not too late. Many projects aren’t guaranteed, in fact none of it is. But if you believe in the technology then you have a chance to invest now. Just like people thinking oh I should have invested in Apple or Amazon, it’s so obvious after the fact. Guess what? Nothing in life is guaranteed. I’m here to take a chance. What are your thoughts?",
