It&#39;s a token that provided right to vote on a poll for what they should focus on next, but that&#39;s literally it.</p>\n\n<p>I exposed them for having a fake address on their website, since I looked them up on Google maps and called the business that was actually listed at that address. I also exposed the fact that the rum was selling for $200 a bottle and that the guy running the coin literally had zero prior experience making alcohol. </p>\n\n<p>I essentially just listed information from their website and got threatened with legal action.</p>\n\n<p>Best part though? The mod in question stopped posting 4 weeks ago and Moonpirate has fallen over 93% since he sent that PM.</p>\n\n<p>It sucks when people lose money. But its hard to sympathize with people who threaten legal action to stop you from sharing your opinions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
