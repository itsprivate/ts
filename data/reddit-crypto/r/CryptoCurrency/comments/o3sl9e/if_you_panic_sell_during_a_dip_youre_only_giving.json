Of course it's your money so you should do what's best for you, but if your goal is to make money selling this low probably isn't the best choice. \n\nAnd yes, this is (or will be in the future) true of other coins too, but it's especially true of Bitcoin given its small and fixed supply and the growing institutional interest.",
