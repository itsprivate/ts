Because of the gains that I got from my DCAing in crypto slowly, I was able to case out most of my stuff to pay the remaining 200 bucks of loan. Im a free now and it feels amazing. Im sad that I had to sell most of my coins but hey..I couldnt ever complain, I can only be grateful. </p>\n\n<p>Funny how a random meme last year brought me here and slowly changed my life. In this short time I learned incredible amount of financial stuff, learned about tech and crypto in general. For the first time in my life Im grateful to a meme.</p>\n\n<p>Now the next thing Im planning to do is farm more fiat and hopefully get a bit more child friendly apartment in a safer city for my kids. </p>\n\n<p>Have a superb Sunday my lovely people and have a drink on me!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
