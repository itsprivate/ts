Millions of people have made tidy profits off SHIB, and some of them talked about this back in January when we saw the devs behind SHIB were smart as shit.</p>\n\n<p>SHIB, Doge and every other meme coin is not a shitcoin. A shitcoin is an altcoin which is any coin other than Bitcoin. Meme coins are advertising for crypto and good for hyping the currency as a whole and to make money off of if you play it right.</p>\n\n<p>Paying attention to meme coins have changed my life, but be warned that If you first hear about a meme coin on Reddit it’s almost always too late.
