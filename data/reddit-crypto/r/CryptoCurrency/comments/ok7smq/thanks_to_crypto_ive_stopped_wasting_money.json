My whole life I’ve been an impulse buyer, as soon as I get in my head that I want something (I can afford) I buy it. I can’t really explain exactly what’s caused it but now a days I ask myself if the item I’m about to purchase is a necessity or if it’s a luxury. I’ve stopped myself buying so much shit that I would have otherwise not even disputed. Crypto is something that’s grounded me financially. I enjoy investing in my future and the future of crypto. I’m extremely grateful to be in the market at this time, despite some people saying we’re in a bear market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
