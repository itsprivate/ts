I used to be very depressed, with really no hope for the future, no goals, and really not much to live for. Learning about, discussing, and investing in crypto, with a lot of that happening here, in this sub, has filled me with so much energy, joy, and passion over the last 11 months or so that it&#39;s really kept me going. I&#39;ve been able to distract myself from some of the hardships of life with what I&#39;ve found to be one of the best &#39;hobbies&#39; out there. Cryptocurrency and this sub as a whole have given me a new hope for the future, and honestly a reason to look forward to waking up tomorrow. And for that, I thank you all!</p>\n\n<p>Infinite Love ðŸ’•</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
