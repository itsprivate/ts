There is a separate &quot;non-profit&quot; Foundation corporation that puts that money off chain. The foundation has a history of closing deals without requiring the payment to be made by buying Algo.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I put non-profit in quotes because, like many other non-profits, that doesnt mean they dont pay themselves very well. The average salary at Algo is a respectable $130,000.  Yeah.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When Algo created a CDBC for the Marshall Islands the price did not move for a) the above reason and b) because it didnt use the Algo mainnet. They instead deployed a fork and all the adoption benefits went off chain. (SOV).<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unless you work at the Foundation, youre not going to see a penny of that.  Those consulting fees will be paid with fiat off chain and the adoption is forked elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Algo&#39;s price seems to be driven entirely by the small transaction fees and speculative investors, half of which I have to question if they understand the above dynamics</p>\n\n<p>The maneuver that pissed me off is that Algo sold and trained the Marshall Islands how to install the &quot;SOV foundation&quot;, so not only does the alleged better future governance of Algo not impact the CDBC they installed but what they sold is a system of self sustaining cushy foundation jobs under the guise of digital currency progress</p>\n\n<p>None of the above is moving dollars into Algo. The foundation can sell all of this by making its clients pay for everything in Algo, but they choose not to.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m calling it like I see it</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
