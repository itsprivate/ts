I use Kraken as my main exchange because they are secure and i trust them. I like the way the app is designed and the support is amazing aswell.</p>\n\n<p>However they lack the stacking opportunities CDC has. The main reason is im using it as a second exchange is the Debit Card. </p>\n\n<p>In germany gaining 2% cashback is actually quite a lot. For example AMEX offers 0,5%, Amazon aswell (more if you order on amazon). Those deals literally just suck.</p>\n\n<p>With the ruby card (350 Euro Stake) i get 2% Cashback and Spotify cashback worth 10,63 every month.</p>\n\n<p>That alone is like 36% Return a year (!).</p>\n\n<p>With recent events (coinbase listing) <a href=\"https://Crypto.com\">Crypto.com</a> overpassed Tiktok in the play store. They really stepping up the marketing game with formula 1, UFC partnerships and a lot coming up. Q4 is about to be wild and they promised us.</p>\n\n<p>I bought in at 9cents and was like, Damn im late. However i tripled my money within 8 months and the card works flawless. I just buy groceries and fuel with it. </p>\n\n<p>If you have any more questions im happy to answer them. My honest opinion is that this card is a no brainer for EU (cuz we somehow arent involved with great cashback deals like the US)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers, David</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
