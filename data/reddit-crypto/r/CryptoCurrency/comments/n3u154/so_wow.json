Kindness costs nothing (most of the time 😉) and the ripple effect you can have in the life of another soul is not lost on me and I commend you guys for jumping on this lambo of cosmic love. \n\nI'm not a rich guy, I make coffee for a living. Sometimes to be god, to be what you want to see in the world you have to sacrifice, and while it isn't much it's been an honor and a pleasure to help who I have (you know who you are kings) and to give a little bit of my light to you. \n\nMy inbox is obviously popping off, so I'll do my best to speak with whomever about whatever when I can; you are all valued and valuable. The love that this place has for one another shouldn't go unnoticed and shouldn't be forgotten, moons and crypto in general have such huge potential to be more than money, and I encourage you all to take this leap with me. \n\nSome of us have massive amounts of moons, and I encourage you to give what you can to those who truly benefit from having it. To those I couldn't get to, I see you, I hear you, and I won't forget. \n\nNamaste and be love. \n\nu/anotherjohnishere \n\nP.S. Keep an eye out next distribution 👀",
