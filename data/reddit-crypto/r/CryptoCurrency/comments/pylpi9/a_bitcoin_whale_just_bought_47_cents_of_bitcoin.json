The whale currently has 112,764.59 BTC and just bought 47 cents more today. This is extemely bullish, because if a billionaire thinks it&#39;s worth his time to buy 47 cents of BTC, he must be thinking we can go to 1 million per Bitcoin soon, to make it worth his time.</p>\n\n<p>So if you can afford it, I would recommend to also buy at least 47 cents of Bitcoin, because it seems like he knows what he&#39;s doing. (In the past week he bought about 500 BTC by the way).</p>\n\n<p>But on a serious note, it&#39;s usually a good sign to see whales buying, because they make the price go up and down for the most part. Hoping for at least a new ATH by the end of the year, I think that should be doable. </p>\n\n<p>Ps. This is not financial advice, if you lose your 47 cents, don&#39;t sue me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
