Hope it helps some of us.\n\nFor example if you buy a coin at 100 dollars and the price dips by 20% to 80 dollars, to recover losses you need to gain 20 dollars.\nGaining 20 dollars from 80, we require 25% price rise. Please take this into consideration forever\n\nWhat we shall do to minimise losses:\n\n1. Dollar Cost Averaging: It is always advised to buy in parts and average out your investment price.\n\n2. Buy on Dips: Always buy on dips and possibly try to double your portfolio on each dip like this to average your buy price. \n\nFor example, if you have 600 worth of USD to invest in total\n\nBuy 50 first, \nthen next 50 on a 5% dip, \nthen 100 on next 5% dip,\nthen 200 on next 5% dip,\nthen 400 on next 5% dip, ( you can change percentage according to the coin you are investing, as each coin has varying volatility ) \n\nSuch a strategy (just an example) can be adopted which can help you recover your losses way quicker than others as you would directly be averaging from your just previous investment.\n\nRegards",
