They are listing any coin willing or capable of paying listing fees, but still ignore decentralized coins with no centralized funds to pay the ransom. Coins like Digibyte, Monero, and Nano are not just ignored, but seem to be blacklisted from the big players (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Binance US, etc). Ask yourself why? Honestly the trading fee revenues would be much higher on these coins then some shit token absolutely nobody wants or trades. Sure it&#39;s not an instant ransom, but it would be much more profitable long term for these companies and support decentralization and sustainability. So why?</p>\n\n<p>/End Rant</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
