This can be very benefitial if you plan to HODL anyways, but tax reports for it can be a nightmare in some countries.</li>\n<li><strong>Mining</strong>: Making your PC do computational work in order to support the network. If you have a gaming PC, you can most likely mine ETH with a nice profit (up to ~150$ per month atm).</li>\n<li><strong>DeFi loans</strong>: You lend money to others on a DeFi platform and earn up to 10% interest on it. Can also be done with stablecoins which don&#39;t have the volatility of traditional crypto.</li>\n<li><strong>Yield farming</strong>: Another way of lending your crypto, this time to a trading protocol and recieve some of the trading fees in return.</li>\n<li><strong>Air-drops</strong>: Air-drops are sending small amounts of a new coin to a lot of different wallets in order to promote it. You can sign up and get tiny amounts of free crpyto, but I&#39;d recommend using a new, empty wallet for it as airdrops have also been used to attack ppls wallets.</li>\n<li><strong>Games</strong>: Yes, you can get paid to play video games. Some offer you NFTs or small amounts of crypto as rewards. However, the amount is usually pretty low unless you play for a long time. Also be aware, there are a lot of scams out there (e.g. some games seem to just ban users that started making a decent amount of money). Some suggestions are Wave Ducks, Spells of Genesis, Beyond the Void, Huntercoin.</li>\n<li><strong>Coinbase rewards:</strong> You can get rewards for watching videos about crypto/defi/trading. Probably doesn&#39;t just apply to only coinbase, but it&#39;s the one I am aware of!</li>\n<li><strong>Moons</strong>: Probably the most obvious one. <del>Shitpost to farm them</del> Post entertaining and helpful content and recieve moons as a reward for upvotes!</li>\n<li><strong>Brave Browser</strong>: Blocks tracking and rewards you with crypto for ads that are displayed!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I will update this list, so feel free to post your suggestions and experiences! :)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions, you guys are awesome!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
