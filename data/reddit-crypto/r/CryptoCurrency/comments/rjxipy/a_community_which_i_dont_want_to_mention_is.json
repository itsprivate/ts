Is Reddit going public a dangerous thing as a whole? I read about buying a DAO on here but was a little confused, what do y’all think will happen? Lots of people are worried that Reddit will get less user friendly with more ads coming in, I really love this community and all the information we share to help each other out. Ideally creating a decentralized Reddit on a block chain would probably be a great idea to have a second place to gather and communicate, especially since it will push crypto into more real world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
