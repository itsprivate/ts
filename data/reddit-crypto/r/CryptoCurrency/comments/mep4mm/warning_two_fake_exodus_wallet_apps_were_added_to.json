If you don't feel comfortable downloading the apps in order to rate them, you can mark the legitimate reviews as \"helpful\" by clicking the thumbs up icon. You can also report the app without downloading it first. \n\nThe fake Daedalus Wallet app wasn't removed from the Google Play Store until there were multiple posts made to spread awareness of the scam and to encourage others to report it.
