Due holding UNI, I got some other airdrops too last year which also helped me build my portfolio significantly.\n\n \nI wouldnt say it’s all luck but I would say yes some of it could be based on luck as a lot of my low cap picks could very well have just gone to zero. But they did do multiple x and here I am.\n\nYes, I did my thorough research into the projects I was investing in but as we all know that price doesnt always reflect the quality of project (*cough cough DOGE..*)\n\n \nI've never really enjoyed my job and just stayed on to get by my daily expenses. I've always wanted to travel the world and work with some NGO.\n\nAlthough, I can’t celebrate yet but am hopeful to hit my targets before the bull cycle gets over.\n\nI am going to go on a world tour after quitting my job and going to start working on blockchain projects in future. Already have started to learn solidity (my first coding language!).\n\n \nTo everyone who are new here: you can also make it. Just hold strong through the bear market and don’t chase pump & dump projects.\n\nAlso you don’t always need a massive capital to achieve your targets.\n\nThank you!",
