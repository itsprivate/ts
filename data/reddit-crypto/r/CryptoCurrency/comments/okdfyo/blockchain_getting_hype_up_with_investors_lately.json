At least, that’s the impression one gets from the daily funding announcements that are eagerly reported by crypto news media.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s little doubt that digital currencies have seen remarkable growth. Spurred on by the incredible growth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the field of cryptocurrencies has only continued to expand. Many digital currency enthusiasts believe that these investments could produce a new batch of digital currency millionaires (or billionaires).Another common reason to invest in cryptocurrency is the desire for a reliable, long-term store of value.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike fiat money, most cryptocurrencies have a limited supply, capped by mathematical algorithms. This makes it impossible for any political body or government agency to dilute their value through inflation. Moreover, due to the cryptographic nature of cryptocurrencies, it is impossible for a government body to tax or confiscate tokens without the cooperation of the owner.</p>\n\n<p>This property makes cryptocurrency attractive to people who are worried about hyperinflationary events, bank failures, or other disaster scenarios. Bitcoin in particular has attracted attention due to its deflationary and censorship-resistant properties, leading proponents to describe it as &quot;digital gold.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>One of the most impressive and unique aspects of cryptocurrency is also a significant liability. Since cryptocurrency does not rely on a central intermediary, it falls on the user to safely store the cryptographic keys which control their blockchain address. Investors who choose to explore the digital currency space should be aware that a number of special security measures are absolutely necessary, and that even those measures may not sufficiently protect their holdings against hackers working constantly to refine their techniques. Is this all worth the hype it’s getting lately? Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
