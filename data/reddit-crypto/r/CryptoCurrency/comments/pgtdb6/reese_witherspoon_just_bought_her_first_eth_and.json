Some have just welcomed her to the crypto community, others immediately tried to get her on their crypto podcast or simply wanted to give her advice.</p>\n\n<p>But then there are also the generally anti-crypto people who accused her of &quot;gambling&quot; and how it&#39;s &quot;bad for the planet&quot; (lol) and the Bitcoin maximalists who ridiculed her for buying ETH and therefore falling for what they consider to be a &quot;grift&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I know Twitter isn&#39;t exactly representative of the real world, but still quite fascinating how emotional people react to a famous person simply investing into a cryptocurrency lol</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Mrs. Witherspoon, if you&#39;re also active on here, welcome and let me assure you that buying ETH was definitely a fine choice. I also liked you in Legally Blonde.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
