Why is that? Has the company failed to deliver what they promised? Are there coins that have developed further/better than ADA? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a total noob at crypto so maybe the terminology I used above is wrong... but hopefully you get what I&amp;#39;m trying to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I guess I should&amp;#39;ve emphasized that I&amp;#39;d like to know more about the utility/tokenomics/tech, etc of ADA... long-term, is it a good hold? If so, what&amp;#39;s your conservative guess for the price projections in 1 year, 2 years, 5, 10? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
