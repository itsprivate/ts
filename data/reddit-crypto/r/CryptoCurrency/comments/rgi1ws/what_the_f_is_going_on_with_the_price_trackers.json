Should we panic or keep calm?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also for those dreaming such a market would be a reality, can you imagine the inflation needed and the stupendous prices of every day stuff in said market?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous ! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have fun Boyz!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ditch CMC, CoinGecko is more independent and superior in every way ! ( and CMC copied their swag store...bad CZ ! )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
