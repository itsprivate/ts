I don’t know if people thought that smart contracts would come from one day to another or what, but we all know that Cardano likes to take it slow. The fundamentals of the coin are the same today than 1 month ago, so why would your thoughts about ADA change? Nowadays too many people move from trend to trend, and they can’t stand a coin being stable for more than 1 month. Remember that 1 year ago ADA was at $0,09 and now sits at $2, do what you want with your money but you will regret selling ADA just because it had 1 month of no movement. ADA was always known for being a “stable coin” anyways, did I miss something or what’s the reason for all the hate? Are they just mad that shitcoins pump but not ADA?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
