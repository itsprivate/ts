Therefore, they ask questions like: \"what happens to my coins if I delete my wallet? How can I move my voins to my new PC etc.\n\nI find it necessary to stress the follwing fact:\n\n**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**\n\n**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**\n\n**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# But where are my coins?\n\nCoins are \"stored\" in the blockchain. The blockchain is a really long list of every transaction between (coin) adresses. Since all transactions are known, and adresses are public, the amount of coins at a given adress is known, too.\n\nThink of a coin adress as a letterbox made of (indestructable) glass: everybody can see how much is inside, everybody can stuff coins into it, but **only the person(s) with the private key can take something out.**\n\n# But what does a wallet do?\n\nThe most important feature of a wallet is to (securely) hold the (private) keys to the corresponding adresses on the blockchain. Therefore it allows you to access (sent/spent) your coins. **Think of it like a big keychain.**\n\nTo generate keys and adresses your wallet uses a **seed phrase of 12 (or 24) english words**. Entering the same seed phrase always generates the same keys/adresses. Setting up a new wallet starts with a random seed phrase.\n\n# Questions?\n\n* How do I move my coins between devices/different wallet software? -> *You just enter your current seed phrase into the new software/ the same software on another device.*\n* So do I lose my coins if I delete my wallet? -> *No, since they are still in the blockchain. Without a wallet you are not able to do anything with your coins, though*\n* This means I can have the same wallet on different devices (i.e. pc/tablet/phone)? -> *Yes. Be aware, that you have to keep all those devices secure.*\n* So if lose my seed phrase, my coins are gone? -> *Your wallet will show you your seed phrase, so you are good as long as it is still installed. If you neither have your wallet or your seed phrase - then yes, nobody can access them anymore.*\n* Does that mean that anybody who knows my seed phrase can move my coins? -> *Yes!!*\n\n# TLDR? [edit]\n\n* coins are stored at adresses on the blockchain,  not in a wallet\n* a wallet gives you access to your blockchain adresses\n* the whole access thing is \"compressed\" in a 12 (or 24) words seed phrase\n\nTherefore: \n\n* protect your seed phrase!\n* don't lose your seed phrase!!\n* everybody who asks for your seed phrase is a scammer!!!",
