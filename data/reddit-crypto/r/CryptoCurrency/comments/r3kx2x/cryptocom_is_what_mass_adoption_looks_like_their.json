In one single swoop it cuts away all other reasons needed to explain to someone what the hell crypto is about and why on earth should they be interested in it.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t get any more understandable than &quot;Free Netflix and Spotify&quot;. That&#39;s the hook that makes people perk up and listen, because they <em>get it</em>. And then they&#39;re ready to hear about some of the other benefits. &quot;So you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s like a bank except <strong>they&#39;re</strong> the ones paying <strong>me</strong>?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It also puts Crypto.com in great company by association. Because &quot;We&#39;re the Netflix/Spotify of cryptocurrency&quot; is precisely the position they want to be in and are marching towards.</p>\n\n<p>CDC and its advertising will bring hundreds of millions of people to cryptocurrency. Add in the forced staking, another stroke of genius, and they&#39;ll have hundreds of billions of dollars in the vaults. This company will be like the whole world&#39;s crypto bank if it succeeds.</p>\n\n<p>People compare BNB to CRO and think BNB&#39;s market cap is close to the max CRO can reach, but with the vast hordes of new users about to enter the game, I think CRO will far surpass BNB in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, you could say I&#39;m bullish on this one. I&#39;m also scared about the giant being built (please don&#39;t be evil), but for now this one seems like a very obvious investment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
