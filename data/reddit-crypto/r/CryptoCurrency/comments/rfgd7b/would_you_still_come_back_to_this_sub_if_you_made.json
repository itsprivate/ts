And would you still check crypto news or would you cash out and leave the crypto space?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I guess I would reduce the time I spend on this sub, crypto new or watching the charts. Even thought I don’t plan to ever leave the crypto space, I would deffinently take a break from social media and crypto in general the first weeks or maybe even months. I admit that I do spend too much time (even if it&amp;#39;s worth it) thinking about crypto and checking the news/charts. So taking a &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; break would be great, especially for my mental health. Moreover, I do think that even when you make life changing money, you still want to make more. Would that be the cause to return 24/7 top the crypto space? Or would it be the perfect occasion to achieves new goals outside of the crypto field? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
