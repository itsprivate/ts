People sell and things get liquidated! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, selling and taking profit is great! But timing the market is hard! If you start panic selling for less than you paid, that is when you start losing money. Until you sell, you are never down! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way the Market goes up, it will also go down too! That is how it works. We wouldn&amp;#39;t know the good, without the bad..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use these dips in your advantage...Load up on more! Becareful not to over spend, as the market can keep dipping.. DCA with caution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice, but Ive been here since 2013 myself and have seen many &amp;quot;2017s&amp;quot; and many &amp;quot;May&amp;quot; crashes... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not to not sell for less than than you paid! Remember that! Especially if you are in this long term.. The Market will recover eventually! Stronger than before!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
