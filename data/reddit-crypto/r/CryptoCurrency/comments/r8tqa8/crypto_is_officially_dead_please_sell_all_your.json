This is definetly not a normal occurrence in the crypto world, please do not look at charts and notice this is a common occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead please panic sell, and leave crypto forever. I definetly do not intend to gobble up the panic sellers, no, I believe crypto is 100% dead this time. Its only up a few hundred percent this year which isn&amp;#39;t enough to confirm its now an institutional, mature asset class. Being only a few trillion dollars, it will likely disappear overnight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So again, please panic sell, the end is hear, and please continue to post about how scary and world ending this 10-15% dip is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
