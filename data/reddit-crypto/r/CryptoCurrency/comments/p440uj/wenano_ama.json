This has enabled so many individual users to distribute Nano to anywhere in the world without worrying about fees, delays, or technical difficulties. We have also caught the attention of globally focused charities that are looking to harness the power of decentralized digital currency to better meet the needs of their respective clients.</p>\n\n<p>We have so many plans for this platform and are incredibly happy and proud of the great support we have received so far from both the Nano Community and the crypto community as a whole. To help get into the details of what we have going on we have a few of our core team members here to help answer some questions. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Tipanano\">u/Tipanano</a> - Anders - Founder</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Sbhuson\">u/Sbhuson</a> - Scott - Lead Backend Developer</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Benlo_0\">u/Benlo_0</a> - Ben - Brand / Communications Manager</p>\n\n<p>You can download the app for Android or iOS by visiting our site here: wenano.net</p>\n\n<p>We’ll be on at 4:00 pm EST/ 1:00 pm PST to start answering questions.</p>\n\n<p>So without further ado, Ask us Anything!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
