We were once college students or just young folks struggling to make it just like you.   \n\nHere are some thoughts:   \n\n1. Keep your day job. (Or get a day job!) Mine fiat by hard work every day to invest in cryptocurrency if that's your goal. Work hard and efficiently.   \n\nYou'll be happier working - I don't care how many people want to stay home and do nothing. You'll get bored. Or depressed. Or start drinking. I promise, it's not all roses having no purpose in life. \nAs u/antonito901 wrote in a good article on this sub, Crypto = Great. Crypto + a Job = Wonderful!   \n\n2. Even if you get your moon, stay in school or build your dream.  Start a business, do what you love - not what you're told to love;  go to trade school or college, even the school of hard knocks. Just get educated, wherever, however, you can. Money is not the goal...a better life is.   \n\n3. Your 20's, 30's and 40s may take you far from family and loved ones, but work hard to keep connected with them as they will become even more important to you with each passing decade. (Not crypto advice but living advice!)   \n\n4. Investing is risky. Don't invest what you don't have. Pay off debt (I learned this the hard way) and your life will be so much more worry free and happier. Buy necessities such as a simple car or house before that Lambo. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Don't dabble in meme coins unless you have lots of extra money you can afford to throw around.   \n\n5.  Getting Rich Quick is usually a scam. If it were easy,  why doesn't everyone do it? Stay away from poo coins. Don't get angry when older people suggest that meme coins have no long term value. Most or all will not. Even Doge's time will come, it will grow old and out of people's minds unless it quickly develops more use cases.  Stay off CryptoMoonShots.   \n\nFinally, failure is okay, even in Crypto. Each investment will teach you a lesson. Each time you sell will give you information. You twenty and thirty somethings have a LIFE CHANGING opportunity with cryptocurrencies. Remember it might take time,  don't sell on a whim or a worry.   \n\nGood luck, I hope you each reach your moons, no matter what it is!",
