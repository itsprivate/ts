It&amp;#39;s been a roller coaster. I&amp;#39;ve lost a lot and I&amp;#39;ve gained a lot, both only on papers. Should have would have could have, all these regrets piling up day by day has exhausted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s time to take a break. Maybe it&amp;#39;s time to recuperate from all of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve decided. It&amp;#39;s definitely time to take a looooooooooooooong break from everything. From the charts, from this sub, from any crypto news, I&amp;#39;ll be uninstalling all my exchange apps as well, so that when I come back everything would be fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be living without fear for my investment, cause I trust the projects I put my money into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope when I come back, this sub will still be the same. Now tears are falling from my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you next year guys!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
