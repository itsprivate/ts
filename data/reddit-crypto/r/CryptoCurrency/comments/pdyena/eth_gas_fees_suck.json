Ridiculous. All the excuses people give for it is bullshit, dealing with eth will be a rich man&#39;s game if it stays like this. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m effectively done trying to do anything actually useful on the eth blockchain. Will be trying out Solana, Algo, Tezos maybe Cardano when smart contracts are out. Anything would be better than eth at this point. </p>\n\n<p>And yeah yeah layer 2 solutions blah blah blah, sorry but naa, if I have to jump through hoops just to do anything, it&#39;s no good. Maybe I&#39;ll come back in 10 years when it&#39;s maybe usable and &quot;eth2.0&quot; is close to being done.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
