It makes you resistant to sim-swap and 99% of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use Authy but Google has an authenticator as well. The beauty of Authy is you can create a password for all your 2FA keys, back them up to the cloud and download them to any device using your pass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck out there and fuck scammers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
