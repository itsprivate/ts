This has been a dream of mine since I was a little kid.\n\nGrowing up, we didn’t ever have that much and I routinely saw my single mother tirelessly work 3 jobs to support me and my sister. We grew up in a beat down house in a bad neighborhood but she worked to give us everything she could, often giving us food just for her to skip a meal and go to sleep hungry.\n\nA few days ago I sold a bit of my ETH (~20%, sold all on my ledger that I was holding until rocketpool) due to a redditor convincing me that taking profits isn’t always a bad thing. If anything, my mom deserves this more than I need the other 20% of my ETH portfolio.\n\nI’m buying my mom a $700k (as a kid, I thought this was impossible) house in cash that even I would love to have. I’m currently closing on the deal, signing papers, etc etc. over the next week to secure the keys to the house. I’m tearing up even writing this!\n\nI’m just a college kid with too much ETH. 5 years ago I didn’t expect this. I got lucky. I realize this. But i’ll be damned if my momma doesn’t deserve this. No amount of profit could buy this feeling.\n\nDon’t give up. If anyone of you dream of buying your mom a house like I am, don’t give up. I’m so thankful for crypto and this community as a whole. I couldn’t have done this without you all. \n\nCheers.❤️\n\n*Shoutout to u/TheTreeOneFour for convincing me to take these profits a couple days ago. After witnessing the 2017 crash, I realized you were right. You were the one that provided me valuable perspective, and I am forever grateful.*\n\n*Update post coming in the next week or two :)*",
