So yesterday I figured I would tip out moons to people that didn&#39;t have any. Two things became apparent #1 about half the people commenting did not know what a moon even was #2 a lot of the people commenting did not know they had to unlock their vault. If you just comment &quot;what are moons&quot; a bot will give you a link to a detailed description of what a moon is and how to set up your vault (which is an eth wallet). I will actually comment below and spawn the bot for those who want to learn about moons/vault. A few people activated their vault just to discover they already had some moons. I hope this helps a few people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
