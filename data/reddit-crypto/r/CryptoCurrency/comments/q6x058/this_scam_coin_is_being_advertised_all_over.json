This coin is currently the 8th most viewed on Coinmarketcap (probably due to spam by its makers). The coin already has a market cap of $230 million. </p>\n\n<p>If you go to their website, the entire coin &quot;team&quot; is just made up of Indian scammers and possibly a few hacked accounts. Also, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/safearnBSC/status/1447634182784487429\">these scammers cant even bother to write their own code</a>. I tried to trace all these people and absolutely none of them have any real social media from their LinkedIn pages. </p>\n\n<p>Their lead developer &quot;Ajit Singh&quot; does not exist. His liked Twitter profile doesn&#39;t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Their marketing manager &quot;Praveen Rai&quot; doesn&#39;t have any socials, and his LinkedIn experience shows a company that leads me to an open field in Tennessee.</p>\n\n<p>Their chairman of the board &quot;Sam Kelly&quot; is most likely a hacked LinkedIn account. All his information is stolen from <a href=\"https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/author/s-kellychorusfinancial-es/\">this website</a> where he clearly is shown as an author without any Crypto experience.</p>\n\n<p>Their subreddit is also managed by one moderator who spams posts every few minutes and deletes everything negative.</p>\n\n<p>You can already see where this is going. $230 Million is a huge amount of money that is being scammed from the people. It&#39;s unfortunate that people don&#39;t bother doing their share of research before buying coins like these. This is a massive scam that&#39;s being pushed everywhere. Please DO NOT invest in this coin, 8th viewed in CMC is not a small deal. Many people are going to lose their hard-earned money to these scammers.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Evergrow shillers can gtfo with their AMAs. Not only does that guy look barely similar to Sam, why is he lying about his qualifications? And most importantly, their entire code is fucking copied from another project. Most of the socials the people working on this are fake, even companies where they previously claimed to have worked don&#39;t exist </p>\n\n<p>A bunch of faces on zoom without any identity won&#39;t change anything. Evergrow is a copycat scam project.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
