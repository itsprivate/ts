We&#39;re no more pleased with the old guard than you are. We&#39;re not all on our knees blowing Trump or re-electing dinosaurs just because they&#39;re old, too (there aren&#39;t many options out there to begin with). So please, try to qualify the boomer bashing with &quot;most&quot; boomers don&#39;t get it. I&#39;d agree with that. Most of my friends my age think I&#39;ve lost it going in on crypto.  Fuck &#39;em. But I&#39;ve had plenty of younger folks who can&#39;t even make change for a dollar if the cash register doesn&#39;t tell them how.  It&#39;s not all about age.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
