In the upcoming parliamentary session, World&#39;s second largest nation in the world is gonna legalize crypto in it&#39;s country very soon. This would mean that this is a really big news for crypto. Till now, Indians faced really bad experience with respect to buying crypto. The exchanges in India were abandoned by many payment partners and banks due to RBI&#39;s instructions, that they should not work with crypto companies. When we want to buy some crypto through exchaneges, we couldn&#39;t deposit money inside the exchange wallet, as banks are not supporting them. Still now this is the same situation, we&#39;re currently using a third party app to deposit fiat in exchange wallets. So, cheers this is all going to change soon. And fellow members in this community, there are currently more than 10M crypto investers from India, imagine huge influx of investments coming in the coming days, I&#39;m sure of this we&#39;re going to the moon really soon. And bullish on polygon if you know what I mean.:)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
