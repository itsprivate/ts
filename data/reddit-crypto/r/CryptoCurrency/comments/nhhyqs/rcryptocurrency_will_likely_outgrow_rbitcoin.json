I own BTC, Ethereum, and I earn money for part time work in some alts, and I am thinking of buying a few alts that are in the top 20 on coingecko.                \n\nBTC Maximalists will argue, \"Altcoins were created to enrich their creators and their friends. Nothing more.\" because Satoshi never sold any of his original 1 million or so bitcoins. I don't fully agree with this statement, but I feel like that is 90% of projects out there right now.                      \n\nThere is cause for concern with PoS as a consensus mechanism, at the very least in the case of Eth I think there is. Imagine you run a node that has 1024 ETH. that is presently almost 3 million USD (assuming 1024 ETH x 2800 USD). Imagine if a nefarious actor or a burglar were capable of breaking in to your home and getting you to unstake that Eth and send it to a particular wallet that he owned. **small things like this are my concern, especially if the owner of a PoS node is a public figure.**               \n\nAnd finally, for the past 12 years, bitcoin has always been the number 1 coin by marketcap. That means after 2018 came and went and NEO crashed from 200 USD apiece to 20 USD (even lower a long time afterwards) apiece or ETH went from over 1400 USD apiece to 85 USD apiece EOY 2018, bitcoin was still at the number 1 spot by marketcap.                \n\n**I don't want to say your coin won't surpass Bitcoin, but if it hasn't happened yet, it is not likely to in the near future (10 years or so). Please ask yourself the following questions:**                  \n\nWhich coin is the \"next bitcoin?\" or in other words, the one coin that will replace bitcoin? Why is it that coin and not bitcoin? And how do you convince all of the banks and the traditional financial system to switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why would they switch to that coin and not use bitcoin? Why not use both? Is there a reason not to use both? This is why I strongly believe there will be no \"next bitcoin\" or a coin that replaces bitcoin.                \n\nJust some food for thought.                 \n\n**EDIT: It completely slipped my mind that there are some people who are here to make money from day trading and that is perfectly fine, in fact that is your prerogative. I, personally, don't do daytrading**                \n\n**EDIT 2: To reinforce the idea of surpassing a particular market cap we need to think of metcalfe's law, and think \"how could such \na massive number of connections suddenly be created with a new coin?\" and to be honest I think there is only one organization or enterprise that could make it happen: Google.**",
