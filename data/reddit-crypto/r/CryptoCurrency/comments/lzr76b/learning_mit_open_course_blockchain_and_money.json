It covers everything from the basics of how blockchain technology works, all the way to how larger financial systems interpret and work with these innovative systems. \n\nThe course is taught by Professor [Gary Gensler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gensler), who has worked under the Obama Administration as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and is currently appointed as the head of the Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team under the Biden Administration. \n\n(There are people who believe his appointment will challenge the development of blockchain from the federal government, while others are glad to see him in this position because of his extensive knowledge on the topic.)\n\nPolitics aside, the lectures are an enjoyable listen whether you are just getting started in crypto or are more advanced in your understanding.    \n\nHere are some links for the course website, and below I made a chart for each session with a video link and description.
