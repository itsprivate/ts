I mean iron finance was not a new name, it was previously on BSC before making the switch. plus fucking Mark Cuban endorsed it.\n\nI bought in with 500$ worth, I know its not a lot but it was 1/4 of my total portfolio so its a lot for me. within days TITAN skyrocketed to 60$ and I was making profits of over 50$ daily. I could've and should've cashed out then, but I didnt.  I wanted just ONE MORE day of the juicy rewards then I'd cash out. \n\nI went to sleep last night and when I woke up this morning, to my horror the price was tanked. I could've walked away with 1000$ yesterday but now I'm walking away with 0. this is because I was too greedy and wanted one more day of profits, and then the rug got pulled ( more of a bank run but still).\n\nnow, I know this was my fault and I've taken a valuable lesson from this. NEVER get too greedy in anything, especially if you are a trader or farmer. many have lost far, far more than me and I feel for them. but the common factor with all of us who lost is greed. if something seems too good to be true it probably is.\n\nI'm not bothering with liquidity farms now, I'll concentrate on making fiat to recoup my losses and focus on investing.\n\ni hope my experience teaches you a lesson, and I hope no one makes the same mistake as me in the future.",
