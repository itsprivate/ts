SHIB token is our first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them.  Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this ERC-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking). Popular worldwide, and already up thousands of percent, Shiba token ($Shib) is the first cryptocurrency token to be listed and incentivized on ShibaSwap, our decentralized exchange.\n\nSo, It’s an **ERC-20 token**. It is a token created on the Ethereum blockchain. That means that to send the tokens to another wallet or just to transfer those tokens from an exchange to your wallet, you’d have to pay the transaction fees with ETH. And do you know how high are the fees on the Ethereum blockchain right now? They are are pretty high. So, that’s the first red flag for me. But let’s continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We locked the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys!  The remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't own team tokens they can dump on the community.\n\nI don’t know whatever the fuck this means. I understand that 50% of the total supply (500 trillion) is gone. So since the total supply is 1 quadrillion, the remaining 50%, have been sent to the wallet of V**italik Buterin. I honestly don’t understand why, but SHIB TO THE MOON, right? Right guys?**\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nSo, now to analyze the tokenomics of SHIB, I’ll need some help from my dear friend. His name is math and some people hate him because he always speaks the truth. So, if you want an in-depth explanation about why the price doesn’t matter, read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5wkwq/will_doge_be_worth_100_a_coin_can_it_become_as/). Here, I’ll just analyze the tokenomics of SHIB.\n\n**Total supply**: since the 50% of the total supply is gone, let's say the total supply is 500 trillion.\n\n**Circulating supply**: 394 trillion (39% of the total supply)\n\n**Price**: 0.000028\n\n**Market cap:** 11.1731504753274 billion\n\nSo, if SHIB actually replaces DOGE and goes to the market cap of DOGE (64.26173717196869 billion), THE 4% OF THE ENTIRE CRYPTO MARKET, a SHIB would be worth .000163 cents. So it's mathematically impossible that SHIB goes to 0.1. Sorry.\n\nThat said, chill, learn, be patient and don’t fucking chase pumps.\n\nEDIT1: grammar. Also thanks for the awards, guys! ",
