You know the feeling of doubling your money and some of you might know the feeling of seeing that initial investment 5x.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a dude in his tirthies. Before getting involved in crypto I invested in S&amp;P 500 stocks and I was so hyped to get those 10% yearly returns!</p>\n\n<p>You can imagine the euphoria I felt when my initial investment in crypto doubled IN A MONTH. At a point, it 5X&#39;d before that dip. The best feeling ever, since I could literaly pay the remining of my mortgage with that sum.</p>\n\n<p>I got a bit greedy and put more money into it before the last 50% dip. You know what? I take that as a costly lesson.</p>\n\n<p>I withdraw 2x of my initial investment to put on my mortgage and I&#39;ll hodl the remaining for my retirement.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to say is I let the euphoria turn into greed, event when I attained my goal. That feeling is exiting and you kind of think it will go on forever, but reality will slap back soon or later. So just a reminder to take profit sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, I&#39;ll HODL ON FOR THE YEARS TO COME! I see that investment as an opportunity to gain financial freedom one day, but the journey with you guys is awesome. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the read, fellow redditors!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
