He also reported that both sweatshirts had the letters “WSB” on them with a image of a baby wearing sunglasses.</p>\n\n<p>“<em>There was literally bitcoin everywhere, it was like witnessing a real-life double-top!</em>” said Laura Latoshi, who also remarked that she saw people rush the ATM and start grabbing as much bitcoin as they could carry. “<em>If you ask me, they are just a bunch of paper-handed bitches who obviously panicked during the last market dip and sold low.</em>”</p>\n\n<p>The car — a 2021 Tesla Model S Plaid — was subsequently spotted by employees working the Joplin AMC Theatre later the same day. “<em>I guess they bought high and sold low and are looking for a way to buy some Lambos.</em>” said Frank Etherman, an AMC box office employee.</p>\n\n<p>A member of the popular subreddit, <em>CryptoCurrency</em>, estimated the theft was worth roughly $6,900,420.00. Police are asking anyone with information to post on <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/791huu5rpkg71.jpg?width=1384&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=280b9d5a128eabde80daa71cfe9720cff990192f\">Thieves make off with $6.9 million worth of bitcoins</a></p>\n\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p><em>If you made it this far, thanks for reading.
