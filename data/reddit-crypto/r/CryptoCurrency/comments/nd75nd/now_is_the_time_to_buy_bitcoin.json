The answer for some  is that they bought during times like this when everyone was fearful and they held. Like I said, it's all about perspective. Bitcoin was four figures for most of last year and Ethereum was a few hundred dollars. The price action of even months is not that important if you are planning to hold for years.

Miners and whales are accumulating too, so it looks like they're not worrying either. Don't be one of those people who panic sells your Bitcoin now only to panic buy if we hit six figures in the coming months. Just be rational and patient, and you will be fine.",
