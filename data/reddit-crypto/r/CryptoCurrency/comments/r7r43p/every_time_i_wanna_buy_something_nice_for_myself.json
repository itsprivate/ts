Now I’m a real frugal bastard so I wear all of my clothing until it basically falls apart. Same goes with everything else. However since I’ve started investing it’s even harder to try\nto justify these types of impulse purchases. The conversation today literally went “yeah I could buy this pair of adidas but do you realize you could just load up on more alts?” Well here I am at home with the same old pair of shoes but I bought more coins. One day I hope I’ll finally splurge and do something nice for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
