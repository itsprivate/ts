The danger is that it gives over confidence and many start to FOMO in money they cannot afford to lose.\n\nSo try and remember a couple of key rules that could save you a lot of money:\n\n- Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose.\n- Don’t invest money you might need in the short term. Anyone who held its Bitcoin through the drops at this point is in profit.\n- Certainly do not borrow to invest\n- If you are late to the party consider Dollar Cost Averaging (google it)\n- At some point BTC is going to create an ultimate ATH for this market cycle and then correct back down by 70 to 80%. Other crypto’s will drop even more.\n- Yes it will correct back down a very big percentage. Usually 80% (look at previous cycles) It could be triggered by a stock market correction when there are no more stimulus checks. Stock market is already dangerously over priced. (Google Stock market cap Vs GDP).\n- You can “Dodge” that correction by progressively taking profits each time BTC creates and new ATH. You want to have cash when the big correction comes.\n- Re invest your profits when we are again in an accumulation zone (after the 80% drop)\n- Those cycle take years, be patient.\n\nThis is not financial advise. Good luck with your investments!",
