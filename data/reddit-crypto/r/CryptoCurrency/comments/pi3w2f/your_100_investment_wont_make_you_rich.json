The majority of people (12% of those polled) were in the $1000-$5000 range. For many, this is a huge sum of money. Depending on where you live or your living conditions this could range from a month&#39;s pay to a year&#39;s, and if you have your entire year&#39;s salary invested that&#39;s awesome! That being said, unless I miss my guess the majority of the members of this subreddit are from the US, Canada, and UK. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing: if you want life changing wealth, whatever that means to you, you need to invest a decent chunk of change. If you threw $100 into the market just to &quot;see what happens&quot; it&#39;s not going to do much unless you&#39;re making some extremely risky plays which may as well be scratch off lottery tickets.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to build wealth it will take time and money, and a lot of both. Get into the habit of putting a percentage of your paycheck directly into your investments. Crypto, stocks, precious metals, NFTs, whatever, just always be buying, especially when you&#39;re starting out. </p>\n\n<p>DCA every day, this is the Gwei.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
