By tweaking some parameters in the future Cardano could potentially scale to 50 transactions per second on-chain which obviously still isn't enough for real world adoption.

It quickly rose into the top 50 posts until a bot deleted it from the frontpage stating \"there are already 2 posts about this coin in the top 50\". But guess what, there are always 2 non-critical moonboy posts about Cardano in the top 50. So it's very unfortunate that technical discussions about this coin have no place on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). I will therefore keep posting this daily, until the day a bot doesn't delete it.\n\nEdit: Since this time, this post didn't get deleted, I will add this. I have nothing against Cardano. But I have noted that there currently exists a widespread lack of knowledge regarding the scalability of blockchains in general and Cardano in particular. This is an extremely hard technical problem that haven't been solved for over 10 years. Cardano is not offering a unique quick fix to this anytime in the near future. But I am happy that we now have more projects than ever (including Cardano) that are working on it.",
