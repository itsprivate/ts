I heard a few numbers but it seems the average person on here has $400-$600 invested. If you become exceptionally <del>successful</del> <em>lucky</em>, and your portfolio hits 100x, that 60k will not buy financial independence. However depending on where you are in world that money could help greatly, for me it would be a fairly decent down payment on a house, but that&#39;s it. </p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t know, a good way to get an idea of max price, it&#39;s to fully understand &#39;market capitalization&#39; (price of coin x total supply of coin). This is why your fractions of a penny coin that &quot;just needs to hit a dollar&quot; will not do so since it would be 80x Bitcoin&#39;s current market cap.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t set yourself up for disappointment,  however we can make some money and change things up in our lives. </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
