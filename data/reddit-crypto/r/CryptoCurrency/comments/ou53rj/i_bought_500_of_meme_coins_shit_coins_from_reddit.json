Thanks to Sonar (PING) I doubled my money. I&#39;m not selling since <strong>this experiment is supposed to show what new, young would investors see.</strong><br/>\nAlso, I did not replace SafeMoon and the update was late too because I was on a vacation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, also, <strong>Sonar bots found my last post, calling me out for considering PING a shit coin.</strong> And you know what? I didn&#39;t do any research (because that&#39;s the point) and <strong>I don&#39;t care.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eulp5i9nj7e71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07edafadbb909eb42f3fd496717882c9540dc5e4\">Don&#39;t take this image seriously.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
