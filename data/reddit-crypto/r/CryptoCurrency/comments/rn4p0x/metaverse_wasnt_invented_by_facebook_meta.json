It exist much longer than few months. Whole idea of metaverse is much, much older. Meta, created by FB is named after Metaverse not other way areound. It is one of many Metaverse projects. If you are not a fan of Facebook and Zukerberg you can just simply never use Meta the same way like you can use other social media instead of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is the same level of ignorance like saying Musk invented BTC. Before you will start talking about something please DYOR. If you have no idea about something don&amp;#39;t talk about it at all, cause you spread  misinformations. It hurt whole idea of Metaverse to limit it to just one project. And CC should always give real informations, not fake bias. If you are not sure ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
