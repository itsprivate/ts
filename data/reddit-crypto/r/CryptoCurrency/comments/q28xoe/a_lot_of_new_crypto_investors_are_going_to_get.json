No offense to any of them, but they have such a one dimensional understanding of crypto and what it can do. I feel bad for them, because they really don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>When we enter a bear market, these shitcoins are going to get absolutely destroyed. You know that saying your grandpa told you: &quot;If bitcoin falls 80%, Doge falls 99%&quot;? It&#39;s true. SHIB and SafeMoon especially, will fall to almost nothing. These people will then sell everything, and claim crypto is a scam or whatever.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
