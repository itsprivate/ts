Even less in crypto market. And even less in the European Union since it’s less common here. I would say 10-15% of European women has crypto investments.

It’s simply because of the percentages of women involved in it.</p></li>\n<li><p>You don’t know the details. You don’t know how the talk went on, you just assume by one sentence. Which actually translated from an another language so it did not have the same meaning exactly. </p></li>\n<li><p>It’s not healthy to assume bad right away of an another human being. Don’t judge. </p></li>\n<li><p>I posted this with a totally different intent. To give you an example of how you can build relationships/friendships with a common rare interest. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just stop being hateful, I can’t really imagine why people are looking for a chance to spread negativity on someone’s happy post.
