My suggested changes to establish Moon Week are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 0</strong></p>\n\n<p>The day prior to the snapshot post (a Tuesday), mods will post a sticky reminding people to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki#wiki_how_to_create_a_proposal\">submit their governance polls</a>.   All governance polls should be posted Tuesday or Wednesday (Days 0 or 1)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the snapshot post by the admins happens as normal and replaces the sticky from the day prior</p>\n\n<p><strong>Days 2-7</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, a mod will create a sticky that links the snapshot post from the day prior and all currently running approved governance polls.  This is the deadline for your poll to be highlighted with the others because the mod may not be around  to add your poll later and people are less likely to check back multiple  times throughout the week to vote on new polls.  During this time, mods may take additional measures to promote the sticky post if the polls are not on track to have enough participation to reach the decision threshold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 8</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the moon distribution post by the admins happens as normal</p>\n\n<p>This idea should further formalize a process for when to create a proposal,  reduce confusion on when to vote, equalize the exposure and promotion of  governance polls, and clarify the monthly moon schedule.  To help people anticipate when the snapshot will happen, we will probably create a list in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki\">the wiki</a> of upcoming snapshot and distribution dates.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your consideration and thank you to everyone who gave their feedback on the meta post</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/o7spnx\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
