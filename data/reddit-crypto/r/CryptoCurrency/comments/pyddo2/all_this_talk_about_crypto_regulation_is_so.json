Fuck these guys</a> You’ve got GOP representatives buying stocks through their spouses, insider trading by dumping a quarter of a million dollars worth of stock weeks before crucial news is released (because you sit on the subcommittee with oversight on the project) and failing to report stock trades when you’ve already been involved in a stock scandal EARLIER IN THE YEAR!! </p>\n\n<p>I mean the hypocrisy is astounding! How do these scum buckets even have the gall to chime in on crypto and propose to literally rewrite the law books when they’re doing this type of shit?? They aren’t even being smart about it. They’re trading on stocks like Tesla and Alibaba but then bitch about the volatility of crypto when Musk literally sends out tweets and plunges the market into chaos. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck these guys. Buy crypto. HODL crypto. Stake crypto. LP crypto. Earn as much as you can friends. These guys are and they certainly aren’t asking  your permission to do it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
