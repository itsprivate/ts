I&amp;#39;m just planning to DCA and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also pretty concerned about this though. BTC has been in the red for most of the month (Nov 4th to Dec4) and it&amp;#39;s just been going down, down, and more down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the long-term holders, you guys &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be fine. If this is long-term (which I highly doubt), then that&amp;#39;ll be a problem. Short-term holders, I wish you guys the best of luck. And for those who said 100k EOY for BTC, please don&amp;#39;t inhale too much copium /j.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and have a good day everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edits: Grammer &amp;amp; word choices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
