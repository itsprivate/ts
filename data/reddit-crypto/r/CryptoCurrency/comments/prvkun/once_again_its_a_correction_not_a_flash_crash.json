It is always a struggle to be powerless, to see losses and feel the pressure, but I beg you please, just hold your hands tight around those diamonds and have faith!</p>\n\n<p>Please know, that experiment is over. All the doubts and fears now, are merely projections... tissue paper that burns up in the flames of progress. Cryptocurrency is here to stay. The adoption is already happening en masse and the expansion of this innovative sphere will be inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>The markets seem to suffer today when you look closely, and it looks pretty grim. However, everything is cycles within cycles, so when you expand out, you realize this is a healthy stimulative trimming of excesses. Massive market collapses, caused by the implosion of a Ponzi scam in the Asian housing sphere, is forcing many to panic worldwide. Liquidations absorb tremendous value and fear always follows.</p>\n\n<p>However, that money lost was never supposed to be there in the first place. It was air leveraged into existence. During a correction, the leveraged positions and any short term traders, get scraped away or sell, like pruning a tree. </p>\n\n<p>I like to think of the support floor by using the metaphor of a fighter. If you’re ever in a fight and you’re not doing too well, sometimes the best thing you can do is fall down to a knee and put your hands on the earth. Then, you breathe for a moment and you get back up, with the power needed to strike with a furious blow! This furious blow is the next ATH.</p>\n\n<p>The market has been brought to its knees, and it’s breathing deeply, but it’s gathering the power of that support and it’s going to use it like Mike Tyson’s uppercut. Don’t fret. Buy the dip. And HODL!</p>\n\n<p>Mentioning your buys during this dip and the most positive perspectives on market correction, automatically get upvoted! And the best comments get awards!</p>\n\n<p>TL:DR - “Crypto is here to stay”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
