This entire week feels like something out of a movie; if you were to go back 10 years and tell someone this was happening, it would probably seem outrageous. </p>\n\n<p>¡Buena suerte El Salvador!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> President Nayib Bukele <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1435023474494410753\">just tweeted an update</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>El Salvador just bought 200 new coins.
