For the current time being, right now, yes.\n\nWhat‚Äôs going to happen and what should I do?\n\nWell, I read a lot of of analyses stating that they expect a BTC crash to 20k before the next 75k + bull run. How long will that be, no one knows.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?\n\nWell assuming you didn‚Äôt time the market and sold at the top and you‚Äôre holding all your cash and profits monitoring the dip my suggestion is this.\n\n1) Current loses make it not ideal or a smart move to sell\n\n2) Hold your investment and forget about it\n\n3) If the crash is for real (might stay for a while), the prices might pick up on the week days and than crash further on the weekends. My personal advice, you won‚Äôt be missing out on any buying opportunities for a while, so don‚Äôt feel pressured. So, that means just hold your shit together and when you get paid and this shit continues to dip into the abyss, by more over time.\n\n4) Hold your shit, delete your wallet if you need to. Forget about it until the next bull run. You‚Äôre investment might seem like a loss now, but if you hold at some point in the future it‚Äôll be a profit.\n\n5) Treat this crash like a mutual fund or bonds, where you‚Äôre money is locked in for a year.\n\nBonus, separate your emotions from the crash, live life, average down when you can afford it. Move on with life.\n\nThis is my personal message to everyone, I hope it helps.\n\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm even HODLing my shitcoins, that‚Äôs the type of game we‚Äôre playing. \n\nDon‚Äôt let life‚Äôs challenges defeat you, you defeat them. Overcome with the pleasure of learning and applying and being in the field and part of the field. You think and analyze and remember, rewards are given to those who work hard and are patient. Make smart moves as best as can be and don‚Äôt beat yourself up from any loses but grow and expand from them.\n\nAlso we‚Äôre all in this shit together and don‚Äôt forget that your not alone,  just know that üòÇ\n\nBTC didn‚Äôt go from $0.01 to 65k in a day. It‚Äôs actually the fastest growing commodity in the world. So remember that.\n\nEdit #2: \n\nI‚Äôve seen some comments and I wanted to clarify something to everyone. I‚Äôm not stating that you should hold onto you‚Äôre investments if you don‚Äôt want to or if you think it‚Äôs better to sell now and buy back when it‚Äôs lower or whatever. Your personal situation is exactly that, your personal situation that only you can control and your decisions are for you to make.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm trying to state is depending on your situation and amount of losses you‚Äôve incurred, it would be more logical to hold your current investments and wait for the crash to get to its bottoms and buy the bottoms with new funds and average down. Therefore with time, once the market does another correction and trends upward again and reaches new ATH you‚Äôve lost nothing and if anything strengthen your position and averaged down.\n\nAgain, this is completely personal to you and what you‚Äôve invested in etc.\n\nTrying to ‚ÄúTime the Market‚Äù, can be a very dangerous thing and possibly incur further loses, so that should be considered as well.\n\nLast but not least, let‚Äôs not forget two very important factors here. At some point in the future, crypto currency will separate from USD and BTC. That‚Äôs when all these amazing projects will flourish and grow even more.\n\nAlso, when I state BTC, I‚Äôm talking about both the coin but also the crypto market as a whole. Right now, BTC is almost like it‚Äôs own index that all crypto follows. Wait for the future when this will no longer be the case, and as crypto grows and matures, things become more independent to one another.\n\nAnd thanks for all the awards and the constructive conversations in the comment section!\n\nCheers!",
