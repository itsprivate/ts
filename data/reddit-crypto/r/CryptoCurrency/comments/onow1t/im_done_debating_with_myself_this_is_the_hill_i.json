After spending years researching this market, I have gained so much knowledge and insight in the industry and learned from others, that it is hard for me to look anywhere else for investment opportunities in my 20s with this degree of confidence. I have concluded this is the hill I die on. 10k of my salary goes to retirement funds 5k to PMs and every single penny outside of that is dedicated to crypto currencies for the years to come. I have plans to live with my family the next 2-3 years until I’m atleast around 25 so lots of liquidity to focus on crypto and potentially change my life or go to zero. I’ve decided if it all went to zero I’m happy I took this one risk which is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my eyes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
