This is an actual question I have been wondering about since I got into crypto. Is it actually possible to live a sustainable life with crypto trading? Or do you need some kind of other income to go trading with?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems to me it&amp;#39;s a lot of luck involved and a lot of traders I watched, did get wrecked or got some big losses. Perhaps they&amp;#39;ve been a bit unlucky while I watched them, but how does trading feel to you guys?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have any of you guys triets to trade at some point? I did so my self, but I got rekt like a proper newb I am. Does TA actually work, or is it more based on marked trend and educated guesses to get the majority of the trades correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
