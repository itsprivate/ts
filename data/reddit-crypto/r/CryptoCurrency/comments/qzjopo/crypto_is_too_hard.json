Do you think your grandma who doesn&#39;t even know how to turn on her Wi-Fi could know about it? Even us young adults are sometimes too lazy to study it. They probably won&#39;t bother and just use a normal bank. They would just go to a bank and proceed with their lives.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Crypto is about decentralization, but we may need to embrace more centralization if we want more adoption now. I hate it, but I think we&#39;ll need it. I think, Real adoption is when companies have seamlessly integrated crypto into their services. When users don&#39;t even know they&#39;re using crypto, they just do. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Like how reddit implements RCPs! We just open a vault to get it. Points are also really easy to send. Example only: Just tap my name and type 5 moons, hit send. It is so easy! Until companies make it *THAT* easy, we&#39;re nowhere near mainstream adoption. That&#39;s why I think we&#39;re still early. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Crypto is still too complicated for the general public. We need companies to integrate it in their services.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
