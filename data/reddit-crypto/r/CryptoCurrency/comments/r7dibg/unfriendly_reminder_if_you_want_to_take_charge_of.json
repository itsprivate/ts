When in fact it was entirely the individuals fault to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really think you can run around giving out your full credit info with your social security and address for a &amp;quot;free Ford F-150 through email&amp;quot; you got randomly sent? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course not. So why are people surprised when they give out the entirety of their private seed or login information for it to get wiped clean? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No you aren&amp;#39;t getting it back. And maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t have had it to start with. If you choose to be that reckless with your own assets maybe you should just stick to the arbitrary monetary fiat system that we already know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
