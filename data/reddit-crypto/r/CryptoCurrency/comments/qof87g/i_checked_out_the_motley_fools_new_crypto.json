If you were an insider or employee, you likely got a sweet payday. If you were not, well <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/icp-cryptocurrency-crash.html?referringSource=articleShare\">this NY times article covers the controversy pretty well.</a> Why would MF choose to press this particular coin? </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yvtnggytx2y71.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2d04832fca522e0092c880e16c5f9c7b7cd4974\">Someone is holding a bag it seems.</a></p>\n\n<p>Theta (THETA) - Theta&#39;s use case of decentralized video streaming is a great idea. I don&#39;t hold a bag, and I don&#39;t know much about it. A broken clock and all that?</p>\n\n<p>Solana (SOL) - The centralized ethereum killer that shut down for 17 hours <em>from too much traffic.</em> Maybe in the end it will live up to the hype. MF, as a bag holder (see above), certainly wants it to.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary, spend $1500 to get hand-held about what all these dang bitcoins are on about</p>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<p>I dunno, just read this subreddit for free I guess.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
