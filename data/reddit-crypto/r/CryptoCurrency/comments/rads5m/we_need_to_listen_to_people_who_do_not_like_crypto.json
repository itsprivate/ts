For this reason, we need to LISTEN to those who aren’t on board yet, because to achieve mainstream use we are going to need to convert people who aren’t on board yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have LEGITIMATE concerns, but they are far too often ridiculed, called dinosaurs, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because let’s be honest, crypto in it’s current state will never mainstream use, and it’s IMPORTANT to address why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average person would never want to touch an asset where a 20%+ dip is a very real possibility. The price is going to have to become more predictable before your average mom and pop want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people, especially younger people are RIGHTFULLY concerned about the massive energy used crypto. Harvard business review estimates Bitcoin alone uses .55% of all the world’s energy use, and more than countries like Sweden. Many people are rightfully concerned about the climate, and as long as the energy input required is so high, it will scare off investors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the last reason many steer clear of crypto are the current headlines that lead to misconceptions. The most that people not in crypto have heard in the last few months are shiba inu and the bored ape nfts. It is our job to educate people that these memes are not our mission nor the things that guide our investments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Forgot to mention gas fees and tether but I’m sure you all get the picture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR there are legitimate and valid reasons why people would not want to invest in crypto. It is our job to listen, educate, and make changes to make crypto better&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
