Even though activity is up in recent months, we have had a hard time achieving the minimum quorum on some good proposals and this may help get people more active in our governance by providing a small incentive for participation while not overly benefiting the highest earners and diluting the distribution.\n\nBased off input from previous proposals, I wanted to make this as simple as possible to qualify for. In order to get this bonus karma, all you have do is vote on at least one proposal in a 4-week session. You do not need to hold any moons when you vote, so this will also benefit new users who have not yet received their first distributions.\n\n##Summary:\n\n  - 5% karma bonus to next distribution for users who vote on at least one governance poll in a 4-week period\n  - Maximum of 500 karma from this bonus in one session\n  - Voting with any amount of MOONs will qualify, even 0\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m7ehzz)",
