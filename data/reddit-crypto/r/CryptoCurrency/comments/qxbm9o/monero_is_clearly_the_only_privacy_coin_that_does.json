At this rate it deffinetaly wont be the last exchange to do so either but all it does is prove that in the pool of privacy coins, monero is the only one which wont bow down to regulators. You got your Zcash and Dash and other coins that claim to be private but none of them have an IRS bounty on them, they all make sure to abide by some form of regulation to stay on exchanges and they all have privacy as an opt in option which dosent make it private to me personaly. Monero does none of them things and regulators are clearly afraid of it. This delisting will probably have a small knock on effect on price in the short term but one day everyone will need 5 minutes of privacy and when they do Monero will always be there for them, a real crypto currency that gets used like cash money. Long live XMR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
