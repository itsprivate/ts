No singular coin should hold the power to dominate the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with increase in adoption amongst the newer users coupled with the thriving &amp;amp; buzzing developer ecosystem ensuring that new projects with newer use cases always comes up- this sure paints a very bright future for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ethereum still leads the market with 80% dominance in the smart contract platform but other projects are slowly catching up to the speed not necessarily intending to replace it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Polkadot with $40b market cap, Solana with $60b market cap, Avax with $30b, Algorand $11b, Cosmos with $7b etc are all making greater strides towards achieving a variety of newer business cases. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even ethereum with all its L2 protocols is trying to make our world more inclusive by making a variety of use cases feasible (mostly by making the platform scalable). The current gas fees on most of these L2 platform lies between $0.15 - $0.50 and with time &amp;amp; updates this will only improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All said- these reduction in dominance is very good for our ecosystem. It represents that we as a community are growing. These dominance numbers should and will decrease with time because our community should and will grow with time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
