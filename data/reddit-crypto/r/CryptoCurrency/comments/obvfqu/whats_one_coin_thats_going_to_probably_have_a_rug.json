If it moons, I get a lot back.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I&#39;d like to continue having high hopes for SHIB, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going anywhere at this point and a rug pull is imminent. Here are a few points:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The highly anticipated SHIBASWAP has been in the &quot;soon&quot; phase since April.</li>\n<li>The recent CERTIK AMA really didn&#39;t do much to kill the FUD. All the devs present had answers for questions we already know answers from.</li>\n<li>There&#39;s a huge lack of transparency and accountability from the perspective of the developers.</li>\n<li>The entire ecosystem seems to be ran by a bunch of kids who didn&#39;t expect to coin to become this big so now they&#39;re trying to take it seriously.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On top of all that, the community is toxic as fuck. State facts and they&#39;ll call you out immediately and gang up on you. They also believe that every damn mention or picture of a Shiba Inu dog is about them. Both the coin&#39;s community and devs are hopeless at this point.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m giving the coin up until the end of August before a rug pull. A turnaround is welcome though but now, I&#39;m okay with seeing my $150 wasted.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
