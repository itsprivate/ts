  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs per the title, I'm planning to learn to write code, with the intention of becoming more involved in the growing world of crypto, and more specifically DeFi. I'm taking a guess that there might be other people wanting to do the same and so thought I'd propose a kind of mutual motivation study group.\n\nI've been aware of crypto for a few years, but other than some investments, throwing the occasional donation to Gitcoin grants and trying to share some opinions with the crypto community in various places I haven't been that involved. A situation that I'm sure I'm not alone in.\n\nMy goals are to learn to develop dApps and contribute to the infrastructure that this new ecosystem is being built on, the barrier to this goal is my negligible knowledge of programming. My background is in physics and as such I've had to learn a few tiny scraps of Python, but I've used this so infrequently that it's really just trial and error. Effectively my knowledge level is zero. What I want to be able to do eventually is understand Solidity and probably JavaScript well enough that I can have a chance at deploying smart contracts that do what I expect them to do and therefore be part of building the DeFi future. In a dream success scenario I can eventually transition to working for a DAO, being paid on the blockchain as a developer!\n\nIf that sounds similar to your position; if you're starting to feel like you want more from crypto than just speculating on the changing value of assets or moving liquidity around between pools; or even if you just want to be able to read smart contracts well enough to improve your chances of assessing possible projects to invest in, then please comment below.\n\n\nA lot of the inspiration for doing this comes from the excellent resource list posted by u/SolorMining at: https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5jz6w/want_to_become_a_crypto_developer_here_is_a_list/ . Much credit for his or her contributions!\n\nFrom that list I've put together a rough plan for study. This is based on roughly 10h per week, which is what I have previously been able to set aside for part time, home based learning. If there's lots of interest from people with different amounts of time then we can change the timings, or have different study groups moving at different paces etc. I've also not checked all of these courses for prerequisite knowledge or overlap, so there might be a much more logical order!
