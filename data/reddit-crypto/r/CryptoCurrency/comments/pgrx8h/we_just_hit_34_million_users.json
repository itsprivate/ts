I guess with more and more people becoming interested in crypto it‚Äôs inevitable that the number of users on this site will continue to increase.  Anyways glad to see cryptocurrency getting more and more attention!  Now they even mention crypto on CNBC, Bloomberg News, etc.. Although they do pretty much only talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum.  That‚Äôs actually a step in the right direction because before they only mentioned Bitcoin.  Now Ethereum is on the radar.. Anyways good luck to you all with your trading!  I hope everyone succeeds in their goals üîÆ</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
