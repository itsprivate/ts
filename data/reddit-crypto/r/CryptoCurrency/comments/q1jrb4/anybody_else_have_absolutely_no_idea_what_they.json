It feels like I’ve just been throwing money into Cryptos just based of Reddit, Twitter or Youtubers tell me to buy. My research for Sol consisted of seeing a long Reddit post on this sub of someone shilling it and the thing was I didn’t even read the post. I just looked at the length and thought if this guy went through the effort to type this long of a post it must be a good investment and a bought a couple thousand worth. A lot of my other positions in my portfolio are very similarly purchased. </p>\n\n<p>Don’t even get me started on the tech, at least half the positions in my portfolio I couldn’t even tell you what they do or their use case. I just know I have made money off it </p>\n\n<p>The saying that everybody is a genius in a bull run is sooo true. Any idiot can just make money right now(source: an idiot) </p>\n\n<p>So to this sub that are not smooth brained like me, how do I go about doing your own research?</p>\n\n<p>I think I’m going to take some profit and  consolidation into stables right then just stick with BTC and ETH till I figure out what the hell I’m doing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
