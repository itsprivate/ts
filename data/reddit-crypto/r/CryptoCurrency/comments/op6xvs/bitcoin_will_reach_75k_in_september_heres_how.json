However, most people fail to use it correctly because they lack the skills to recognize great set ups. Triangles, wedges, cups and handles and flags and pennants and everything else you&#39;ve been told to use might work 40-50% of the time, but what if I told you that there was an <strong>extremely rare,</strong> <strong><em>EXTREMELY BULLISH</em></strong> chart pattern that you&#39;ve never heard of?</p>\n\n<p>I introduce to you: the &quot;Stegosaurus Under a Rainbow&quot;. Charts this bullish are almost always the stuff of fantasies, but as of the 7/20 daily candle&#39;s close, Bitcoin has broken out of its spiked tail range and will soon be on the move to ATH.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dy75jbb9xoc71.png?width=2709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cac507100746399656e9258ea0892ff18ff5174c\">The \\&quot;Stegosaurus Under a Rainbow\\&quot; Chart Pattern</a></p>\n\n<p>So, how does it work? Glad you asked. First, we start with the formation of the head, and most notably, the eyeball. The uptrend into 2021 began to reverse and form the neckline, which ended in mid-February. The long wicks in January, one green and one red, form a level of support perfect for this little guy&#39;s eye to sit at. But, the formation of the head + eye do little on their own, so let&#39;s move on.</p>\n\n<p>During the massive bull run, we see BTC in a strong uptrend, creating higher highs and higher lows between February and the end of May. These form the iconic scutes, (the bony plates on its back) and lead us  gently into the consolidation phase, the spiked tail.</p>\n\n<p>Before I forget, the rainbow is an often overlooked feature of this highly technical pattern. In order to be confirmed, there needs to be a touch from the candles in the head range, the tail range, and each and every scute. Although we almost didn&#39;t get the last bounce from the tail spikes, it managed to eek out two bullish days in a row and close the rainbow.</p>\n\n<p>The most delicate and most important phase is the final consolidation down Mr. Stegosaurus&#39; spiked tail. These choppy movements are volatile and difficult to trade, but somehow the candles managed to outline an exceptionally strong tail.</p>\n\n<p>The nearly 8% swing on the 7/20 candle broke out to the upside of the tail range and confirmed that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Bitcoin is about to take off and reach ATHs very very soon.</p>\n\n<p>See you all at $75k!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
