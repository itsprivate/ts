So I swapped my coins on Coinbase from ETH -> XLM. Then I transferred my XLM to Binance. The transfer fee on XLM was 0.00001 XLM, that's $0,000005!

I know it's kind of hassle, but it saved me a few dollars! \n\nFor example, it now costs you $0.02 to withdraw from Binance:\nhttps://i.ibb.co/mXvxCDJ/image.png\n\nOn most exchanges it costs you a few penny, you can use [this site](https://withdrawalfees.com/coins/stellar) to check the withdrawal fees:\nhttps://i.ibb.co/pQW5CJm/image.png\n\nI know that there are other options such as NANO. Unfortunately, Coinbase does not have that coin.\n\nThis is also a very educational way to see how crypto transfer works. One last thing I want to mention is: DO NOT FORGET to fill in the memo with the correct information, otherwise your XLM will not arrive at the exchange!",
