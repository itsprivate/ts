The episode suggested that paying people in crypto is some horrible inhumane practice because it’s unstable. </p>\n\n<p>Just to be clear, I haven’t seen this myself but I trust that my son wasn’t making this up. He said he thought that some of the things they were saying weren’t true so he was looking for clarification on it. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I find it a little disturbing that they’re misrepresenting and showing only one viewpoint on this technology to middle school children. A lot of them just blindly believe what they’re told because they haven’t developed critical think skills at that age.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
