And although it’s possible (if you buy and sell a meme coin at the right time) I would argue most people will not get that lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that much more people could make a lot of money in the crypto market by just being patient. Here are a couple of tips to achieve just that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a crypto project who’s value you believe in for the long term (10 years or more). Ask yourself: will this coin still be useful in ten years? Understand in what you are investing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest money you can afford to lose or at least money you won’t need in the short term (5 years min) so that you are not forced to sell in a potential crypto winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favor Cryptos that allow staking with decent APY. And stake them for as long as you hodl them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you are in for the long run, become your own bank and understand how to manage your private keys safely. Avoid the exchange failure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be patient, buy more during crypto winter or big dips and enjoy the bull market or pumps. Remember if the past is any indication cycles are driven by Bitcoin halvings and last 5 years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need money in the future consider borrowing against your cryptos (Coinbase offers that option already) so you don’t have to sell them. This avoids a taxable event and allows you to continue benefiting from your average annual growth and staking rewards. This is called a Lombard loan and this is how the rich get super rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would argue if you invest in the right cryptos the best time to sell them will be never. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
