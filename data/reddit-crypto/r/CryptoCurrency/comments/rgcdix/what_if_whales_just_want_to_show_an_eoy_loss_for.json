Might be to re-buy cheap short term, sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if this is a response to all the various countries new legislation around crypto capitals gains tax reporting this year?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would make sense as we close in on the end of the year that Whales might manipulate the markets to crush them, cause flash crashes and liquidate people until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then sitting on their pile of cash from getting out (in part) at the highs of each attack.  Thirsty for the lows they created, they wait for the stroke of midnight NYE and a fresh new tax year to re-buy at a massive discount saving them thousands of dollars in Taxes by reducing the fiat value of each coin in their remaining bag for this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems like the exact kind of tax and market manipulation that makes sense given what we have been seeing, and given how Whale market manipulators do anything to come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course there is no way to know for sure until we get to the first few days of January 2022.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut it&amp;#39;s all starting to look a little bit suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bright side, for those of us that need to report taxes, these lower prices will help us out too... for those that sold or got liquidated due to lows...  they might be missing a massive pump next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Show a loss was probably the wrong language for many whales, reduce the FIAT equivalent value of their holdings to reduce taxable FIAT value EOY in countries that tax based on the perceived FIAT value of your crypto holdings, then buy back cheaper or more with savings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 BTC @ 44k is less taxes to pay than 1 BTC @ 100K EOY and is all that matters in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
