It will cost a little ONE in gas to mint the crypto I used <a href=\"https://cryptoroyale.one\">https://cryptoroyale.one</a> to make some ROY sent it to MetaMask and then trade that for ONE in <a href=\"https://viperswap.one\">https://viperswap.one</a>  Done now I have made my first crypto and I add it to ViperSwap so I can add liquidity. With this first crypto I added liquidity in ONE at a 1 to 1 basis then I used 0.01 or 0.001 ONE at a time to buy my crypto for roughly 100 transactions this ups the price a little and so I leave the coin and over about 2 weeks the market brings it up. I sell a little to recover all that had gone to gas and this crashes my crypto to a very low price. Next test is creating coins that add liquidity too each other here&#39;s a glimps at them all.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xlsi41lf90281.png?width=1843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689c7ba22351bbc1b79de004631fd59c920951b2\">6 Different cryptos all given liquidity too each other and given value form the Liquidity in ONE or USDC  (two named KWP lol)</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/33sse754h0281.png?width=1877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5576fceb2d313db5c17b84520cfcdfe7a03d4333\">In doing this I have managed to add about 20 ONE into liquidity of ONE and my KWP coin and now can sell about 250 of KWP at a time, this is what happens when you do sell a little </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As you can see I had a lot of fun creating all of these but none of them really did very well so I then thought well I need to start with a better liquidity ratio so I create notbitcoin I then add 0.0001 to 1 ONE and I buy a few transactions of 0.001 ONE getting less and less NBTC each turn, now I have a value better than I had before so I start to add liquidity from the coins I have made making sure to work out the math on the current values as close as can with a small amount and then bang I add Billions in my own cryptos which soar the Liquidity and the value of the new coin I have made. If I sell any of the coins that I have added this will drop the price dramatically due to me being the only owner.  Plus I can only sell about 0.0002 at a time into ONE due to the low amount of liquidity in this coin and even that small sale would crash the value.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Its crazy to think this is possible and this just shows you anyone can make crypto and make it look like it has a huge amount of value if I now make sure I buy a little every day and not sell for a few months next year this could be the next doge and will basically follow the market. I could start the trend the not crypto&#39;s instead of meme coins. Stay safe all hope this educates you that it really is too easy to make a crypto and just as easy to make one that looks amazing. Hope you all have a great weekend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
