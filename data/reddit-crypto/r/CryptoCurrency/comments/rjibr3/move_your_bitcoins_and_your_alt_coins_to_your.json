Fractional reserves where they lend out your shares to big whales for 0.1% interest rate to fuck you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto exchanges are doing the same but at bigger scale.  No regulations.  Wild wild west.  I know we have a movement that we move coins out of exchanges at a date every year but why not now?  We are at a historic low of Bitcoin supply on exchanges, why not bump that up a little more?  Why not force crypto exchanges to show they actually have that liquidity?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the US, we have 6.8% inflation in Nov 2021.  Wholesale prices went up 9.6%.  I call BS.  It went way higher.  Fiat printing at rapid rate and chasing fewer goods…. yet fixed rate of 21 million Bitcoin prices tanking?  I call BS.  They use your coins to short the market to tank the price.  F them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
