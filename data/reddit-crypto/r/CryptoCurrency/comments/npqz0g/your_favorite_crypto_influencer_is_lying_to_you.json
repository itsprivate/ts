Your influencer hero didn't buy in 90 days ago. They may not even be invested at all. It's all a ploy to get follows, a told-you-so con that most people are too lazy to fact check. Go back 90 days.

Stop FOMO-ing into shitcoins that have already had their moments. Stop listening to clowns on the internet that will get you rekt. Most of us will never ride that kind of pump and that's OK.
