This guy is earning a lot of money from views he gets and paid promotions he does for different coins. However, despite all of this, he still has the nerve to mislead his viewers with clickbait titles and by promoting worthless coins he pumps just to dump his bags at inflated price to his viewers. Imagine what a greedy slimeball you need to be to do such a thing.\n\nTake a look at this example: [https://imgur.com/a/6ixQh1n](https://imgur.com/a/6ixQh1n)\n\nIn this case it is obvious that BitBoy bought these small coins early, and promoted them right at the peak just so he can create exit liquidity for himself leaving all of those poor, naive people who trust him wrecked. Honestly, take a look at his face. That's a face of a man gets no sleep because his conscience is eating away at his soul every waking minute for all the lives he's ruined financially. What he's doing should be illegal, I hope karma catches up to him sooner then later.\n\nMy advice to all of you is to always do your own reasearch! Take every advice with a grain of salt, and don't trust anyone promoting a coin that will \"make you rich quickly\". Stay safe.",
