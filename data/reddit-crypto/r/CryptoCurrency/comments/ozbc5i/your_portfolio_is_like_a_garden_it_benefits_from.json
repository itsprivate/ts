It&#39;s also hard to motivate yourself into keep investing in a market that just took half your portfolio away.  I personally have had this urge to constantly tinker with my portfolio, selling coins out of frustration with their performance, buying other coins out of what&#39;s essentially FOMO. It&#39;s all bad for you though. </p>\n\n<p>Stay motivated, ignore the short term pain volatility brings, and embrace it instead as opportunity.  This community is awesome and I just wanted to share some perspective for anyone who&#39;s feeling frustrated with the idea of tending to their investment like a day trader would. It doesn&#39;t take much.  Perseverance, a calm mind and realistic outlook on what&#39;s ahead, and yes, NEGLECT. It can give you great tomatoes and pretty decent portfolios.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
