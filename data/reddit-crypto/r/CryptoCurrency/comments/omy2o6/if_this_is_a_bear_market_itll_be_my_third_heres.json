Then when I got interested again I couldn&#39;t remember shit. I found most of my wallet seeds written down in a notebook.</p>\n\n<p>What I couldn&#39;t find though was the seed to <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/18cNTbaDBjC6373M2QcKXusNfyBGYaGc3P?page=1\">this wallet with 0.05 BTC in it.</a> A relatively small amount in the grand scheme of things, but still enough to piss me off. It&#39;s not as if I have the blockchain address bookmarked and I look at it all the time though.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 17/18 it went fucking insane, the ICO mania absolutely had my pants down. I ended up with a decent stash of the top coins but then probably 50+ shitcoins.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the bear came and everyone forgot about crypto and I definitely didn&#39;t learn my lesson. Cryptopia getting hacked rekt me and the majority of the other ICO tokens died within a couple of months.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2020 we go again and yet again I cant remember shit. I&#39;d done a bit better this time as I had most of my stash on a Trezor and a lot of things backed up in a password manager, but there is definitely some crypto with my name on it floating around the universe all lonely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL:DR Go backup your shit, then backup the backup.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
