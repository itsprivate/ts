You also need to pay for the electricity to run your computer 24/7, let&#39;s say 3000$ as a very conservative estimate.</p>\n\n<p>Since Solana has around an 8% APY, that means that you need 1 Million dollars in SOL to <strong>BREAK EVEN.</strong> You are losing money on a Solana node unless you have more than 1 Million dollars. This is a fucking joke. How can we call a platform decentralized when it costs 1 Million dollars to run a node, and 2 data centers essentially control the network?</p>\n\n<p>I know this is going to get downvoted because this sub loves SOL, but whatever. I need to share the truth no matter how unpopular it is.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Check out the pinned comment below, I made a few minor errors</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
