Allocate an initial big % of funds to VCs, key backers at a ridiculously cheap valuation while the project is not even in the public eye, then build some of the features of the project (usually a website, a DEX or couple of pools/farms) and then create a big marketing hyped launch event, where around 10% of the project&#39;s tokens can be bought by the public. Meanwhile, 90% of the tokens are controlled by insiders and VCs who entered at 1/100th the price. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uily92gf9gv71.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a1516e1496dc9524064c4a49ed13484300e700\">Price during deposit perion: $27.

There is a vesting schedule, so the early investors will baghold through a 90% correction right? Lol</p>\n\n<p>There is not one single reason any long term investor must look at these projects. There are several distribution mechanisms in existence today that are much more fair, including stake drops, farm distributions etc where one can acquire tokens of new projects without donating their funds away to the team at a terrible valuation. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the VCs in the crypto space are pure predators. They give zero fucks if the project even survives or not, as long as they exit their investment with a ton of cheese on top. They can hardly be fussed about the late investors or users. This is the rather sombre reality of an unregulated market - the ones making the rules do it predominantly to enrich themselves.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
