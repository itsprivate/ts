(<em>I don&#39;t, but not because of this</em>)</p>\n\n<p>I have accounts on multiple KYC exchanges, each with a different $ amount of my portfolio based on how comfortable I am with holding that amount on the particular exchange. Some exchanges have more coins available than others, so that&#39;s another factor. One of these exchanges is listed directly on the NASDAQ. Another exchange is a subsidiary of a company listed on the CSE (Canadian Stock Exchange). <strong>Note: both DO have the option to withdraw your crypto, so it is &quot;mine&quot;.</strong> It&#39;s 2FA secured and I am forewarned about any maintenance that limits my ability to trade.</p>\n\n<p>If these guys run away with my crypto, I think the SEC and CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) will finally have a reason to stop browsing p*rnhub. It will give them a reason to bring that &quot;regulation&quot; that Gary Gensler is hot for. So I personally choose to believe the days of Mt.Gox and Quadriga are behind us, when it comes to BrandName<sup>TM</sup> exchanges. And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t complain about gas fees. Because I only pay the spread between buying and selling. </p>\n\n<p>With crypto gaining adoption, and being accepted as a security in some states, surely many are to follow. I believe this will lead to more investors and more people being comfortable with depositing and holding funds on an exchange, similar to on a brokerage when trading stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, just my 2 sats.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
