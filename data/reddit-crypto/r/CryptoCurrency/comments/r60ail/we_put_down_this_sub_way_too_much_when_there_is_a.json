For example, I changed phones and lost my moons as a result and &lt;a href=\"/u/nanooverbtc\"&gt;u/nanooverbtc&lt;/a&gt; took the time to help me recover them, with no expectation of anything in return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of people who will wish you well if you are having trouble in crypto or life. I posted a comment about trying to stay positive amidst some life challenges and there were many that wished me well. Would link it  but don’t feel like scrolling through all of my comments to find it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sub is a bastion of knowledge and information, if you ask and seek it. There are posts helping with taxes &lt;a href=\"/u/Kevin3683\"&gt;u/Kevin3683&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/supershwa\"&gt;u/supershwa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/CryptoTaxLawyer\"&gt;u/CryptoTaxLawyer&lt;/a&gt; among others. Posts about NFTs and how to do your own research from &lt;a href=\"/u/_ArtosisCurse_\"&gt;u/_ArtosisCurse_&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/MrBluoe\"&gt;u/MrBluoe&lt;/a&gt; and so many more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We generally have pretty good discussions about the merits of crypto tech and philosophy and ways to get rich or lose it all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of people posting about their mistakes  so you don’t make the same ones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We of course have the moon faucet from &lt;a href=\"/u/UnstoppableOnslaught\"&gt;u/UnstoppableOnslaught&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And did I mention we have moons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I’m sure there is plenty that I missed but it’s important to acknowledge the positive things, not just some of our misgivings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
