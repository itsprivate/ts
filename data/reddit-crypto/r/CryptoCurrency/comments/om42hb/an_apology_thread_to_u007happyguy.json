The comments on his post, and subsequent posts &quot;exposing&quot; him as a liar and a moon-farmer have now been thoroughly debunked and made me incredibly ashamed to be a part of this community, and this is an opportunity for those people to apologise, make amends, and agree to move forward with a less toxic attitude on this sub. I would also like to see them donate some moons to <a href=\"/u/007happyguy\">u/007happyguy</a> as a few of those posts had thousands of upvotes earned off the back of gaslighting the poor guy. Whether you have been in crypto 6 days or 6 years you are never totally safe from scammers, and you all deserve to be supported, validated and believed by this community. Rant over.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
