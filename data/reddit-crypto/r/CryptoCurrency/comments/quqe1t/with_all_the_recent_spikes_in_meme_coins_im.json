Along with numerous faucets and tipping bots that make it easy to get some BAN for free. </p>\n\n<p>And finally the community is great, their subreddit has 30k+ members, which is huge for a project with only a $27 million market cap. </p>\n\n<p>Okay shilling over, go get your potassium</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I also forgot to mention that you can earn banano by helping contribute to <a href=\"https://bananominer.com\">medical research</a>.
