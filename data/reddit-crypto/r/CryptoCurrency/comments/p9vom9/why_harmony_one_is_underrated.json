They aim to bridge all chains.</li>\n<li>Right now it has 2 seconds finality on its chain and even on Ethereum.</li>\n<li>Tx fees are extremely cheap like $0.000·001.</li>\n<li>Harmony’s MC is 1.2B and the price is at $0.12 at the moment.</li>\n<li>The team behind the project is a great team with big names of the tech (look on their website, you will be surprised).</li>\n<li>There is more and more projects built on Harmony (NFT : DaVinci Gallery, Game : Freyala, and you can search there is a lot more).</li>\n<li>Staking, it’s 10-12% APY at the moment.
