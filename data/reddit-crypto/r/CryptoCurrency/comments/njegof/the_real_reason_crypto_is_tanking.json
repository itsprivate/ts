If we can force a major squeeze, it could result in the largest redistribution of wealth (to the people this time) in history. 100K might sound like a ludicrous share price for GME/AMC.. but then again, there are many of us who have had an eye on crypto since Bitcoin was worth pennies. A short squeeze is absolutely possible. All the mathematical conditions exist *right now* for it to happen. \n\nTLDR; There is a class war happening. Know your enemy. It is not Elon or China.
