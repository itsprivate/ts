My question is, how the fuck do people find these tokens before the pump starts?</p>\n\n<p>I know that most of them dont have enough liquidity for taking profits but shit, if I put 100$ in a shitcoin and I can get 1000$ back even if it says that I have 35 trillion dollars I&#39;m happy with it. I know there are a lot of pump and dump groups out there and that they are scams. I&#39;ve been into crypto for a long time now and I have a very decent portfolio with solid projects such as BTC and ETH. But hodling is boring as fuck, I need to find a token I can put 20$ in and experience some emotions watching the price roller coaster because I&#39;m dead inside and nothing brings me joy on these days.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
