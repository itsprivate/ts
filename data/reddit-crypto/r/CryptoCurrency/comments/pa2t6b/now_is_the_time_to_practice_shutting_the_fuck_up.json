Keep posting stories, asking questions, and helping each other. However, outside of Reddit please remember to not talk about your gains to anyone. Not your parents, not your partner, not your friends. Nobody.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because it has zero potential for good and catastrophic potential for bad. If you&#39;re talking about your Crypto investments to people who are not also already interested you&#39;re going to sound like a crazy person gambling away your life savings. People will hear you talking about all the money you are making and either ask for advise, become jealous/envious, or dislike you because they think you are bragging. If they ask for advise they will probably get shaken out during a -3% day and resent you for it. If they become jealous or envious of you they will be waiting in the wings to hound you on down days, even if you are still in the green. If they think you are bragging they will probably stop talking to you. </p>\n\n<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously practice silence. Get used to keeping your gains to yourself. Honestly I would even advise against talking about gains here as well because the internet is rife with scammers looking for a mark. The best way to avoid problems is to just stop talking. </p>\n\n<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
