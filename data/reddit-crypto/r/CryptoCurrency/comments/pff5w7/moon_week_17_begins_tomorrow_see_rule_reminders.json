To encourage someone to vote, link to the Moon Week post so they can participate in all polls and see important information about the voting process</li>\n<li>Rule 4/8 - No derailing the comment section of a post, for example by attacking the author of a poll or raising unrelated topics </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s post is not the typical reminder to post governance polls by Thursday because we have been working to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/p9lmi5/proposed_rcc_governance_framework/\">formalize the governance process</a> and I have already privately coordinated with the authors of all approved polls.  Please do continue to submit your ideas to <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta\">r/CryptoCurrencyMeta</a> if they have not been discussed before</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
