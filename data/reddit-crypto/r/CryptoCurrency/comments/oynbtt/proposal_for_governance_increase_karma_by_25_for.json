  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This proposal is to increase the karma multiplier for text posts, eligible towards moons, by an additional 25% for text posts, in other words the posts created in the &quot;text&quot; tab, which require people to type up their own original posts with a word count minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Currently comments are doubled, and comedy posts count for only 10%. The rest has no multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>This will mean that text posts that people type up will be worth 25% more than polls or link to articles.</p>\n\n<p>Text posts will still be bound by the 1K limit. The 25% will not increase that limit.</p>\n\n<p>This may also reduce the gap between text posts and daily comments, without needing the proposal that reduces daily posts by 50%.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to get into the details of pros and cons, or give you a full sales pitch, I&#39;ll leave that to discussion below in the comments. Feel free to discuss it, and even propose better alternatives if you don&#39;t like this proposal. If you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll gladly hear your views, and encourage you to vote against it if you find it problematic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/oynbtt\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
