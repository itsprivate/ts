Like with everything in life, crypto is not always rainbows and sunshine as it may seem. During times like these, you gotta remember all the talk about crypto volatility - it is mentioned and warned for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Bitcoin was around 20k, which is more than a 140% increase right now. Not to mention all those crazy altcoin gains in the thousands of percent. While I can&amp;#39;t blame newcomers for feeling the panic, these gains are astronomical elsewhere when investing, but greed gets to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to remind everyone reading this that the addiction of watching the charts too much or simply just caring about the market each day is unhealthy. When your favourite coins are bleeding and it seems to be the end of the world, it might be a good idea to find a new hobby or activity to occupy your mind. Literally, no one will remember this &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot; in a year or two. Do your own research, DCA in solid projects you believe in, and call your mom. As the black knight once said: &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Tis but a scratch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
