I&#39;ve never encountered this problem myself, but apparently some people encounter this and I&#39;m just wondering why a solution for this hasn&#39;t been implemented yet. It seems like a pretty obvious solution? Or am I missing something that would make this impossible to implement?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
