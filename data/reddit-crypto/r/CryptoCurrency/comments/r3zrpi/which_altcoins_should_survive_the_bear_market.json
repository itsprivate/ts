I think a rather common belief is that around 80% will either disappear entirely, or their price will never recover to the current/previous ATH levels. Personally, I have my doubts about this number being that high, but I am just a newbie trying to learn things, so what do I know? And that&#39;s beside the point of this post anyway. </p>\n\n<p>In this post I want us to discuss &quot;the other 20%&quot;. So, what coins, do you think, will survive the next bear market <strong>and will thrive</strong> during the next bull. If you could provide some reasoning, instead of just throwing some names or just shilling your favorite alts, that would be much appreciated! </p>\n\n<p>P.S. Just to clarify, I understand, ETH is technically an altcoin, but it&#39;s pretty safe to think, that it&#39;s grown so much it&#39;s, by far, the safest altcoin to survive the bear. Saying this before I get plenty of &quot;ETH&quot; comments, as I would kind of like the focus to be on other altcoins.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
