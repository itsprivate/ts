Their rewards are so fake that it&amp;#39;s ridiculous. No-one will send you 1 eth if you send them your wallet, like and sub and screenshot. Don&amp;#39;t fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are the followers fools? From my point of view, yes no doubt but I&amp;#39;ve been in the crypto for a long time and they likely just heard their hero on the internet talking about a big opportunity to get rich. And many of them are just kids. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you missing a good deed this year? Go and report these assholes on Twitter, IG whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
