Those are insane gains for me. To have a decent back-up gave me peace in my mind. From every 2x or more, I will take out my initial investments to pay off my student debts. Crypto is really a change for my financial state. Am I careful? Yes, maybe too much. But I am not in for big lambo&#39;s. I just want to have a nice family and no financial worries. Yep, that would be nice. And a 2x will already helps with that.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this blew up. Thank you all for the amazing reactions. I try to answer everyone, but it can take some time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
