My mom knew that me and my brother are into crypto so I believe that inspired her to get into it.  She actually brought it up to me today about some game she was going to play so she could get $5 of free Bitcoin.  So later I was thinking about that so I mentioned if she signed up for Coinbase she could get $10 free which is double what she was looking at before.  So.. to make a long story short, the crypto world just got a little bit bigger.  Happy to see adoption continue both at home and on the broader spectrum!<br/>\nGood luck on your trading! Altcoin season starting my friends!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
