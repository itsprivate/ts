For one, in the US you&#39;ll pay less on taxes by letting your investment mature for a year. But, if you want to see real gains in your crypto investments, tell yourself a 2 year hold minimum before deciding on your next move. For two, you&#39;ll find that things are much less stressful when the market goes into a bear cycle. </p>\n\n<p>This is what I told myself for a while now. I wish I would of had this mindset from the beginning or someone telling me this. I may have invested differently. But we live and learn. </p>\n\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve cemented this mindset I&#39;ve been able to live with much less worry when we have dips or bear markets. I have a much easier time DCA&#39;ing every week without worrying about where prices sit. I will say it&#39;s nice when you DCA at a lower average. But when you already have in your head that you aren&#39;t touching this money for 1-2 years, it takes a weight off your chest. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d share this for anyone having any sort of doubts or people questioning themselves on their investments. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck investing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
