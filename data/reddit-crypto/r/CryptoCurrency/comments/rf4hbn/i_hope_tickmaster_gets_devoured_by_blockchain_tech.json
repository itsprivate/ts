Ridiculous considering I don’t even receive a physical ticket anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blockchain, once mainstream and widespread, will break the stranglehold middlemen hold over venues. Imagine direct selling NFTs to fans and locking in price so scalping is practically non-existent. And the artist would get a kickback of secondary sales. Maybe lock in transferring the ticket more than once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s so many possibilities I’m sure these issues will get solved someday soon. This is why crypto is so exciting. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
