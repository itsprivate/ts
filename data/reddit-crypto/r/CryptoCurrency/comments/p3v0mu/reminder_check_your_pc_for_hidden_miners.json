I can not code but I can manage my way with computers. However my PC got infected with stupid hidden miner that was almost impossible to delete. I could not believe that it happened to me. And I still don&#39;t know how I got infected.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke with a close friend of mine who told me there are several types of these hidden miners. What makes them nasty are few things. First of all, the hackers can set up the virus to use just a small percentage of the CPU/GPU so that the fans don&#39;t make the usual &quot;brrrrrrrrrrr&quot; when the CPU is at 100%. Secondly when you open the task manager the virus stops so you can&#39;t actually detect it. And finally even after quarantine and removal it still manages to pop up and infect the PC. As far as I know (it&#39;s basically what my friend told me) it only works on Windows and not on Mac.</p>\n\n<p>Well I still can&#39;t figure out how I got it (maybe via &quot;friend&quot; just like covid &quot;ha-ha&quot;) but anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Check your temps and fans speed and open Task manager. If you notice a significant drop after you open Task manager - congrats you are positive for hidden miner</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
