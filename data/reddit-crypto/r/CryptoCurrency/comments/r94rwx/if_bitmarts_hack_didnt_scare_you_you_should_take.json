For everyone else holding their coins on exchanges, let this be a lesson that you should move your coins to cold storage or another type of storage that is away from a centralized exchange. Until then your coins will be at risk. This means your money will be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DON&amp;#39;T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU!! PROTECT YOUR COINS, PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT AND GET OFF EXCHANGES.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
