There are already people who have most of their money in cryptocurrencies, but all of them leave some in the bank or in fiat in case something with crypto goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banks have been deeply ingrained in our society and our system for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes time to crypto do the same but it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If banks are going to go to war with cryptocurrencies, let them go. We know very well that nothing can happen to them, and competitive and evolving financial system benefits us all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
