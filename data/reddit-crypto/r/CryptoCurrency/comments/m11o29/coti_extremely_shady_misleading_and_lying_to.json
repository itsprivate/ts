  "selftext": "Hi CC,\n\nJust wanted to bring to your attention a project called Coti which has been lying and misleading investors from the start. \n\nA friend of mine shilled me this token about a month ago and I looked into it and found a lot of inconsistencies in their marketing, misleading statements etc. \n\nFor example: The Coti team had **created [this graphic](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*qU4idVUw3Sp8C6uZcxiE-w.png) showing Coti vs other Coins**. They claimed that they have a decentralized consensus mechanism whilst other coins didn't. They claimed to be faster than other coins as well. Upon asking them for proof of tx speed in their TG group, i was banned immediately.\n\nSecondly, they claim to be able to offer \"chargebacks\" by way of a **decentralized jury** that can make decisions on buyer vs merchant issues. When I emailed the team about how to become one of these jurors, they claimed that Jury Selection was done by the Coti Team, to which I responded \"so how is that decentralized?\", and never got a response.  \n\nThirdly, they claim to have **\"zero-to-low fees\"**, but upon speaking to a Coti node operator, I learned that nodes are able to set any fees they like on transactions. So how does that make it a zero-to-low fee system?\n\nToo many thing's do not add up at all, and upon calling out the Coti Team on Twitter - they do not respond. The CEO - does not respond. Telegram group banned me for asking questions. \n\nFourthly, they claimed that they \"**Integrated with Apple**\", whereas in reality, Simplex (a platform that supports 100s of cryptocurrencies including Coti - integrated with Apple). Yet there are hundreds of paid marketers on Reddit and Twitter saying that Coti and Apple have partnered up.\n\n**Guys just beware with this Coin - too many lies and misleading statements - I guess this is all of crypto though. However they are now in the top 150 coins, all by way of lying and misleading investors.**\n\n**edit - just saw that you can't even post to their subreddit as it's \"submissions restricted\" /r/cotinetwork/**\n\n**edit2** the paid Coti marketers/shills have arrived downvoting this and every one of my replies to oblivion. this post was almost at 100 upvotes and suddenly at 60. major brigading happening from new accounts",
