The kids were out with me riding their scooters. She asked if she could quickly use my computer to check something. Thinking nothing of it, I said sure. I was outside the whole time, and my phone was in my bedroom. About 20 minutes later, she and the kids left. </p>\n\n<p>Later that afternoon, I came inside for a dink and to check any messages. I didn&#39;t notice if my phone was in a slightly different place on the bed. But I did notice that there appeared to be some SMS authentications from Binance that had come through earlier. Panicked I ran to the computer to check on my accounts concerned I may have been hacked. Was someone trying to gain access, shit.</p>\n\n<p>After checking everything, Binance, metamaks, crypto, coinbase, etc... Relief poured over me when I learned that all my assets were still in place on my various wallets and exchanges. I&#39;m fortunate to be fairly competent with security. Aside from phone 2FA, I also have email authorisations, Google Authenticator, <em>very</em> long and unique passwords and a Yubikey.  It hadn&#39;t occurred to me that a lot of these could be relatively easily usurped from within my own home. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know of anyway to track use of Google Authenticator. There was nothing in my emails, but that doesn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t sent and deleted. I don&#39;t have any evidence aside from what I&#39;ve described above that it was her, it could have been someone external of course. </p>\n\n<p>Even days later, I&#39;m still a little freaked out. I&#39;m still unsure how to proceed. Haven&#39;t mentioned this to anyone yet.  I guess the moral is that the more secure your accounts the better, but its possible that your next hacker may not be a total stranger.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
