Not much though is put in by the developers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mass adoption is out of the question. The only use case i see are a bunch of crypto millionaires having a VR party in Decentraland (sounds hella dumb). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would rather spend money on Fortnite costumes (which are at least brilliantly designed). I dont even like Fortnite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see the same case with NFTs. BAYC and Crypto Punks are og&amp;#39;s but the rest are plain copy of original idea. Rest of procedurally generated crap is undermining works of amazing desiners and artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
