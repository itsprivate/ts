If you haven’t opened your vault yet, you are literally missing out on FREE MONEY.</p>\n\n<p>And to those who do have their vaults open, congratulations!

That’s right, less than 100,000 members in total have opened their vaults and if you’re stacking moons then you’re ahead of the game!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
