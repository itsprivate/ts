I think currently the most useful projects are projects such as Mirror Protocol, Terra, privacy coins (Monero and Secret Network or any other privacy project with private smart contracts), Ethereum and etc. because all of these projects currently can be used to solve difficult real world problems. Such as owning foreign stocks (Mirror), or having a trustless stablecoin (Terra), financial privacy, money laundering (which I’m not endorsing), trustless asset swaps, and innovative financial apps (Ethereum).</p>\n\n<p>I think all of these use cases can be summarized by the word “cryptoassets”.
