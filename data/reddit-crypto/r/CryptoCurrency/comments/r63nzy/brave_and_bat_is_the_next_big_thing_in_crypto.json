He also created JavaScript (most popular programming language in the world) and co-funded Mozilla. Brave is the new Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The Web3 browser as the gateway to 1 billion crypto users&amp;quot; (Brendan Eich)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brave Wallet. Like MetaMask, but native to the browser (no extension to install). Multi-Chain wallet (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and more). DeFi support. NFT support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brave Swap (DEX aggregator in the browser). Users will receive a monthly rebate for 20% of their swap transaction fees in the form of BAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brave Search. Best alternative to Google. Use BAT to buy keyword ads on Brave Search (not there yet but it&amp;#39;s coming).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://search.brave.com/\"&gt;https://search.brave.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BAT is really Brave doing revenue sharing (70% of the revenue from Brave&amp;#39;s ads is returned in the form of BAT). The adtech industry was estimated at 319 billion in 2019, and is expected to hit 1 trillion by 2027. In 2020, about 97.9% of Facebook&amp;#39;s revenue was generated from advertising. More than 80% of Google&amp;#39;s revenue comes from ads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the future websites will be able to run Brave ads and earn BAT (users will earn BAT too if they opt-in). This win-win-win relationship is the future of online advertising (users win, content creators win, and advertisers win).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pay with BAT: buy and sell stuff online using Brave Wallet and BAT (coming in the future).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brave is the first IPFS browser in the world. IPFS is basically BitTorrent for the web. BAT will play a role here too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of October 2021, Brave has 42.1 million users. The growth is insane. Brave is literally next Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also read this great Twitter thread:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/h_bitcoiner/status/1465694105413898244\"&gt;https://twitter.com/h_bitcoiner/status/1465694105413898244&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
