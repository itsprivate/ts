Then covid hit and no one has been allowed into the country for almost 18 months now. So there is zero medical tourism now. So her salary went from making a shit ton of OT hours, to getting cut completely in half from base salary.</p>\n\n<p>So the past 18 months she, and like half the country, have been fighting with the banks to defer payments until the country re-opens. Well they went to court and the bank was supposed to wait. About two weeks ago her account was emptied by the bank. They just took it from her.</p>\n\n<p>No she still owes like $10,000 which is quite a bit of money here. They saw on her transactions history that she bought some crypto, thanks to me, and they want that too. The thing is, there is nothing they can do to take it from her. She was worried the bank was going to call the exchange or the &quot;electrum&quot; company and take it. I almost started laughing because she really doesn&#39;t know that that isn&#39;t possible. The only way they can get it is if them come to your house and torture you until you give them the seed phrase or make the transfer, which they won&#39;t do. I mean this isn&#39;t North Korea...not yet anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Now she has been getting calls daily from the bank harassing her about it.</p>\n\n<p>Damn it feels fucking good to have even just a little bit of power over the banks.</p>\n\n<p>PS: She is still going to pay the loans back when she can, just a really shitty situations right now for most people. Banks don&#39;t care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
