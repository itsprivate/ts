Does it change anything for the HODLers? I unless you need to get out for some reason, no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont care about all the articles screaming about a 100k BTC or a 500k btc, neither about youtubers telling you the same thing. Even if we go through a 4 year old bear marked or whatever, I really dont care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the average investeror, price fluctuation doesn&amp;#39;t really mather if you just want to HODL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot of psykological pressure involved, expecially if you&amp;#39;re in it to get rich fast. I dont believe it&amp;#39;s possible to get rich fast for most people, but crypto could be a hedge against inflation and I do believe crypto will continiue to grow over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to see red numbers, but it&amp;#39;s not a loss before you decide to sell!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your take on crypto? Bullish? Bearish? Neither?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
