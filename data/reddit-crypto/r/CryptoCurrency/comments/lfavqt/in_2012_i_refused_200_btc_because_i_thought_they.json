He even gave me some software to mine bitcoin by myself, I didn't even try it because I didn't care. I don't remember a lot because I just thought it was boring so I didn't listen to him. \n\nOn summer 2012 he decided to quit the university and to move to East Europe to open a mining farm. \n\nHe offered me to move with him and become business partners but I refused. So he offered me to go there just for one month to help him to set up the infrastructure. \n\nHe offered me about 2000€ so I initially accepted. \nBut there was a catch: he didn't have cash because he spent everything on this project. He offered me the equivalent in bitcoin: 200btc for working 1 month. \n\nI asked him why he couldn't convert btc in euro and he said it was quite complicated, so I thought that if it was complicated for him, it was impossible for me. \n\nI told him I was sorry but I wasn't interested in working 1 month and getting paid with money I couldn't spend. \n\n\nI never cared about bitcoin in these years. I even almost forgot about this story. \n\nLast week I saw my ex classmate on a TV show where a reporter interviewed him about bitcoin. I discovered that he actually opened that mining farm and he became an entrepreneur. \n\nAfter I saw him I remembered about this story and I checked how much is worth a bitcoin. \n\nIf I understood well, if I accepted and kept those 200btc now I would be a millionaire. I even discovered that there are now a lot of websites where I can easily convert bitcoins in euro or just trade bitcoins. \n\nI'm literally shocked, I feel stupid and I would like to do something about it but clearly I lost the train and now it's too late.",
