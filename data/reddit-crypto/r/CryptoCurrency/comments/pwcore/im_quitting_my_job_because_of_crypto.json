Your wallet ( physical) can be filled with money, but someday for reasons that are not totally depending on you, the time that you spend having some of it could be all thrown to trash.  I decided to live my life, to enjoy what I was really meant to be and this inspired me to create my own business that actually makes me forgot about the charts.

It’s all about being wealthy, not rich.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
