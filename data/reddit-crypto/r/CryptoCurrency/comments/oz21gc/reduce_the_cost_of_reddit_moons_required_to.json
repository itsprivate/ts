There will be a fixed price set by the mods which will then be used to evaluate how much moon is required for the month.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be easier to implement the pricing of actual moons into this system once the Main Net launch has happened. So it&#39;s a win win situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/oz21gc\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
