Stick to a plan that works for you so you don&amp;#39;t have worry about short term price fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be happy with how much you have right now. You&amp;#39;ve bought coins for the money you had available at the time. Sometimes it can be the perfect solution to disconnect from everything. Forget about crypto for a period. Get your ass out and get a good workout in, catch up with family or friends you haven&amp;#39;t been talking to for a while. Read a book, play your favourite games or do what makes you truly happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget your mental well-being comes first. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones first guys, it&amp;#39;s especially important during these times. I wish you all a happy holidays and new years!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
