And that&amp;#39;s what you get. You&amp;#39;ve sent your coins to a wrong wallet? Well, it&amp;#39;s gone now. It&amp;#39;s your fault. Your not getting it back. Shouldn&amp;#39;t have clicked on those random links. You just got rug pulled? Should have done your research more carefully instead of trusting some random YTbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just a simple reminder that crypto is still operating largely in decentralised manner. Yes, regulators are coming after us. When? Who knows. In some countries sooner, in other countries maybe little later. But right now it&amp;#39;s pretty much a wild west. Accept it. Or you know, go and save money with your bank at 0,05%&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
