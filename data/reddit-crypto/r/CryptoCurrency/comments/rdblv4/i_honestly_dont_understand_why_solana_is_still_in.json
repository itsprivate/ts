I did lose a lot of faith in the blockchain, but I found the concept of &amp;quot;proof of history&amp;quot; very interesting, so I was still interested in the coin. \nThis was followed by the large price increase and the necessary hype, which caused the price to rise even more. SOL was quickly in the top 5 cryptos and took over ADA&amp;#39;s spot easily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in September the system goes down again for several hours. I thought this would be the end of SOL. This was when I was extremely surprised that SOL&amp;#39;s price remained stable and even continued to climb quietly. I didn&amp;#39;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when the ddos ​​happened and the system was down again recently, I really really thought that SOL was going to plummet (especially in these difficult times full of uncertainty). This STILL didn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly wonder how it is that SOL is still in the top 5 cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
