This was shortly before the dip that’s happening right now. And the dip is too juicy to not buy anything right now (although I kinda wanted to stop transferring fiat to crypto). So I did what any reasonable investor would do: I smoked one and bought the Dip on Crypto.com‘s CRO Coin. Been eyeballing the Coin before it pumped and bit my ass when I’ve missed out on it now is the time to step in. Also I plan on DCAing some into CRO every month. What are your thoughts on this buy? Also, DON‘T do drugs but DO your own research!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
