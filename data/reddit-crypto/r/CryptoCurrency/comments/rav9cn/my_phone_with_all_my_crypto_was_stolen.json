Taking sometime since I&amp;#39;m using a shitty phone right now. Thank you for so many responses. I&amp;#39;ll update you as soon as its done. In the meantime, if you come up with more solutions, I&amp;#39;m happy to learn about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update 2: Any idea what to do about Google Authenticator app. Binance not letting me change password or log in without the code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I did a very stupid thing and I would like your help to understand the best-case scenarios. Yesterday, someone stole my phone. All my crypto wallets were logged-in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mobile: Nokia 8.1 (Android), Google&amp;#39;s Find my Device isn&amp;#39;t helpful because the device is offline/switched off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the stupidest thing I ever did in my life which is none of the wallets had fingerprint authentication enabled or any passcodes. I have no explanation to give for this stupidity. What are the options available?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I go to recover my accounts using my private keys, (on another phone) how do I disable such wallets on the missing phone?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can I remove the information from the phone and wallets remotely?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I do recover my wallets to a new device, are they still active on the old device? If so, there must be a way to deactivate the app (on the stolen device). I don&amp;#39;t want to lose my wallet addresses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Will the culprit have access to my central exchange accounts? Should I make new ones or just file a ticket to ensure they know my account could be breached?  any thoughts or solutions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts or solutions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I apologize in advance if there are any grammatical errors or if I haven&amp;#39;t been able to explain myself properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PPS: Please upvote as much as possible so that I can get any experienced answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PPPS: If such a topic has already been discussed, please share the link with me in the comments, I&amp;#39;m sorry I don&amp;#39;t have much time to go through all the posts to find similar experiences. I&amp;#39;m already busy dealing with restoring my other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
