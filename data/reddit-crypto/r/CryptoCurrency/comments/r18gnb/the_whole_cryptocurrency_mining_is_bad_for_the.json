What adds to the hypocrisy is that all these &quot;environmentally progressive&quot; leaders use their private jets to go to environment summits to barely pay attention to what&#39;s going on. Also, add to that the active fear-mongering towards nuclear energy, one of the greenest energy sources known to man, and twisting it into a nuclear apocalypse ticking time bomb.</p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s talk about mining, how it&#39;s detrimental to the environment. No, I&#39;m not talking about cryptocurrency mining, I&#39;m talking about coal mining, which, long before the birth of Cryptocurrency, has been the black stain of the environment and contributed to climate change before crypto mining even existed. What&#39;s worse is that these mining companies use cheap labor in third world countries to mine for coal, which is one of the most dangerous and health hazardous jobs in the world, all for the sake of being as profitable as possible.</p>\n\n<p>All this is happening, yet these pretentious fucks want to lecture us cryptocurrency miners about how we&#39;re a bane to the environment? FUCK off. It wasn&#39;t my fault that oil and natural gas was used as the main power source of nations years before I was born. Countries had to literally invade and destroy nations and other peoples&#39; lives for oil, yet the same politicians want to point their fingers on miners.</p>\n\n<p>You fucks wanna talk about the environment? Change your main power sources to green energy, and then we&#39;ll talk. But for now, I&#39;m just gonna sit back and mute your voices over the sound of my 80 decibel miner.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Removed a word</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I&#39;m seeing numerous replies about Whataboutism. Your very own homes, with your plugged in electronics and appliances, are consuming a lot of energy (even when these electronics and appliances are not in use). These glamorous Christmas lights that people put up from November until Valentine&#39;s day, huge energy consumers. Main point is that as long as nations are using energy sources that generate pollution and greenhouse gases, every single necessity that we use (lights, cars, houses, computers) will negatively impact the environment.\nIn addition to that, and this specifically applies to Americans, I keep hearing about HOAs that prohibit homeowners from installing solar roof panels on their homes just because they look ugly or ruin the aesthetics, and add to that people not liking wind turbines because they either look hideous or kill birds, or nuclear energy because people think that another Chernobyl is bound to happen. As long as this mentality is prevalent, expect nothing to change.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
