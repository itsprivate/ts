I have this irrational fear that one day I will feel shitty if by some miracle I make a decent amount  of money off crypto and he doesn’t make anything. Also he’s been struggling a lot so hopefully one day this will become a worthwhile amount of money that he can find helpful. It’s not a difficult amount of money for me to dismiss so I just send it to his wallet knowing he doesn’t check it. I don’t know why I’m sharing this, maybe it’s a stupid idea. Anyway, that’s what I’m doing and will continue to do.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: changed .8 to .08 because that’s what I meant to say.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I know he still has his keys because he had $50 in btc he planned to never sell. As far as fees go, I send $30-60 at a time and it’s really not that bad especially right now. I am falling asleep but thank you for everyone’s kind words.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
