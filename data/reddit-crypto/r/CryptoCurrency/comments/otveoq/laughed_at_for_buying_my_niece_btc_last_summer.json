I figured she&#39;s probably gonna get loads of crappy toys that she will quickly grow out of . I had just started buying BTC earlier that year so I thought I will get her some, I only bought £50.00 worth for her when it was worth $8000ish dollars. When my brother and his wife the parents of my niece opened the card to a message that said &quot; You now own 0.0066 Bitcoin&quot; they seemed a bit confused, my brother in law then laughed out loud and said&#39; Who buys a baby Bitcoin&#39;. I have to admit I felt pretty bad... It&#39;s now worth almost £300.00 and counting. I said she can withdraw when she&#39;s 18.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did post this in the BTC subreddit so apologies if you’ve seen it. I just really loved the responses the post got and how it was inspiring people to do similar things, so I thought I’d reach out into this sub.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
