Sooner or later we will be going parabolic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t sell your coins to the whales. You are likely to buy back in later with FOMO at a higher price. Just sit tight, take a break if itâ€™s stressing you out and enjoy the ride. You would much rather hold bitcoin than fiat in any market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care legends and happy investing !! ðŸš€ ðŸš€&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
