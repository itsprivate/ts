We'll only go out of our way to remove threads that are disguised as adverts for a coin or just low-quality shill efforts.                 \n\n**My personal position, from me alone.**                   \nI am a mod, my position does not represent the other mod positions. I am a whatever works-a-malist, not a maximalist. But to this point in time, I'm only convinced that Bitcoin has been a functional store of value (Bitcoin is past its 2017 ATH, but LTC and BCH aren't, is there another coin that has broken its 2017 EOY / beginning of 2018 price tag that was previously in the top 10?). I also hold a conservative amount of Eth and wBTC. I will also say that if we check the yield on high-interest savings accounts at American banks in 2021, it is (for now, anyway) far more appealing to put your money in a DeFi application. This might be the one bull run where we go up Trillions of dollars and don't correct for a long long time, but that's a story for another time.                   \n\n**The problem isn't just in /r/bitcoin.**                   \nA long time ago I made a post in /r/XRP or /r/ripple asking a question about ethereum and I got banned. I wish I could find the post / message in question, but I can't because it was so long ago and when you get banned you only get a DM, it does not become a post and I would literally spend the whole day looking for that post if I had to. At any rate I apologized to the mods of that subreddit, told them I read the rules and felt like an idiot and told them, \"I promise not to break the rules again.\" They said, \"Since you read the rules, we'll go ahead and unban you.\"               \n\n**/r/bitcoin mods don't always follow their own rules, but no one is perfect.**                 \nNow then, **there are two areas where I do take slight issue with /r/bitcoin:**                  \n1. On old.reddit.com, their [subreddit rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/rules) are difficult to find and...                 \n2. They have one rule that says \"The Primary Topic is Bitcoin.\" I've seen quite a few non-bitcoin but pro decentralized software threads that are in plain violation of this rule. [prime example](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cz0zys/decentralization_power_hong_kong_protestors_using/) with this thread about mesh networks (they allowed a few other threads like this as well).                  \n\n**My own position on the crypto market.**                  \nI have said this a dozen times - nothing will replace bitcoin - but I have previously failed to emphasize that *some cryptocurrencies do have a use case*. At best, there will be apps and dapps that will become \"interoperable with\" bitcoin - hBTC, RENBTC, wBTC, etc. I'm also going to condense my counter-argument like so: In the 2017-2018 altcoin seasons we saw \"superior technology\" available in several different flavors - dPOS (EOS), DAG (IOTA/NANO/HBAR) getting shilled, and more. I have to ask you guys from a realistic perspective, \"If you have 20-30 USD of bitcoin to spare, then just download Phoenix wallet, and play around with lightning, then ask yourself, \"Will people really switch from BTC to my coin?\" Nothing else is as secure as bitcoin.\n\nEDIT reason: formatting on the final paragraph.                   \n\nEDIT 2 reason: justification of altcoin price action in the first paragraph after the TL;DR.                 \n\nEDIT 3 reason: formatting of the penultimate paragraph.",
