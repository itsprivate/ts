Nevertheless, it seems &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people here are willing to help their fellow investor out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My personal favourite is &amp;quot;Nobody knows shit about fuck&amp;quot; and the more the &amp;#39;experts&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;influencers&amp;#39; let you down with their predictions and fool-proof analysis, the more you realise you actually need to do some research yourself. (Seriously, please don&amp;#39;t blindly throw money at something a celeb/Youtuber/influencer promotes).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a lot of us here, crypto is our first time dabbling in an investment, and as we have all learned it is one wild market. What tips have you got for your fellow investors here on this sub? Any golden rules you follow that you wish you had learned earlier? Even if only basic, or something more advanced for the veteran traders, share things that have helped you along your journey!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
