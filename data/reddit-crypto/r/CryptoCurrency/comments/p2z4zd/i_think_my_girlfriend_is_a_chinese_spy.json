A clear sign that crypto was in trouble. My girlfriend was concerned as I bought the dippiest dips in this period. &quot;What if it never goes back up?!&quot; She would say... &quot;what if you lose money&quot;. Of course, I ignored her and DCA&#39;d right into that dip, then went and had dippy eggs and soldiers for breakfast to celebrate my dippy discounts.</p>\n\n<p>Given that she also loves Kung Pao Chicken and dumplings, I feel certain that she&#39;s an undercover operative working on getting me out of crypto. I&#39;ve decided to stay in the relationship, as an undercover agent myself. I&#39;ll be sure to report anything I find.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
