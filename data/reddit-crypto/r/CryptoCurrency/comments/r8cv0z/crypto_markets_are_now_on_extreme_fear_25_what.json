Mind you, the last time we saw these levels were at the May crash. So what does this all mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... It means that there will be some great discounts on our favoroute coins! Like no- i&amp;#39;m not trying to inject anyone hopium or positivity or something. There *&lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; will be a huge dip and im ready to accumulate as much Crypto as I can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived the same thing with the May crash as well. Never understood why we call them *Crash. Like, so negative for a huge wholesale discount...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, it would be no surprise if markets decide to take a deep dive for some time with the current indicators. When it does, simply get your Fiat, and pray the Crypto Gods that it won&amp;#39;t dip further!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
