Yes the scarcity should drive the price up but there are so many other coins out there will people really get into a bidding war for the original coin? It&amp;#39;s even more concerning when so few (not actually that few) control such a large amount of the supply. Will it become more of a collector item? Will the whales start unloading if the price starts to drop? If they do does the price go up or down as people react to it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn&amp;#39;t thing this would be an issue for another ~50 years but with adoption accelerating maybe it will happen sooner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
