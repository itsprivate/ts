From what I understand, people cannot see how much you hold in your Monero wallet and they cannot see who is sending money to who, or receiving money from where. Correct me if I am wrong. I am surprised this isn't a big issue yet with cryptocurrencies. Besides that, it has been around since 2014, so it's unlikely to perform a rugpull anytime soon.\n\nLooking at the charts, I have no idea what happened with Monero after 2018. Why did crash so low and is only now recovering? Does anyone know?\n\nLet's talk more about it. I am interested to hear your thoughts and learn something new. Again, I don't hold any Monero.
