Knowing my dad, he can’t be convinced that I might know something beneficial that he does not know about, but if one of his friends told him about Crypto he’d listen lol. I decided to say I don’t own any crypto and don’t plan on buying any, just so I can never hear him talk about it again lol. If he does not act like that, I wouldn’t have to lie.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone experienced something similar?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It kinda hurts more now, knowing that I probably experienced this alone, but I am also glad that people in general got parents who are normal people.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
