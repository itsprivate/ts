However, it is like that because Binance is “forcing” its use. Moreover, I don’t like the fact that BNB is “centralized”, so for me it doesn’t deserve the 3rd spot. Does ADA or Solana deserve it? By being in 3rd spot I mean in the long term, not a coin that pumps this bull run and then we never see it again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
