The event is a forum for discussion of zk scaling, a proofing algorithm that promises to be the future of blockchain computing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The zk proofing mechanism stands for &amp;#39;zero knowledge&amp;#39;. With this consensus mechanism, transactions are sent to a third party for verification. However, the third party doesn’t have access to the exact information it is verifying. It combines the benefits of third-party validation with an added layer of security, seeing as the third party doesn’t have full access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in active users and wallets. MATIC had seen a steady increases of users on the network, currently at an all time high of 282,760.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem Expansion and the addition of new protocols to the polygon network, most notably Idex, who recently announced Idex v3 will launch on the polygon network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In recent times project launches from NFT projects like OpenBeSea and gaming and DeFi projects like Rainmaker games, harvest finance and jarvis network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are tour thoughts on MATIC? Are you bullish, do you hold a bag? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be good to see what you guys think as I don&amp;#39;t see it often in this sub&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
