Ever since then I've been neglecting everything else in my life.\n\nI wasn't surprised by my destructive addiction. Before crypto I was addicted to something else---Youtube, commentaries, and beauty guru drama. I was a shut-in loser with no job and no friends. Due to 3 years of high school bullying and dysfunction family, I suffered from major depression and anxiety disorder that kept me from functioning in workplace or school. So when all of my former classmates graduated from college with bachelor's on June of 2020. A lot of them got high paying jobs straight out of college. My self esteem hit rock bottom. Only my former close friends keep in touch with me, but I ghosted them. That's when I got into crypto. I was bored. I had 3k in savings from my sporadic minimum wage jobs. I was a dropout, jobless, and living with parents at 22. I wanted to make a quick buck and to make myself feel better. (I never traded btw. I merely bought and hodl)\n\nThen I got me a temp 3 month contract job that snagged me some quick money. In that job, you work alone. It was very emotionally taxing. I got even more alone, but I was making money. Made $8k total. All into crypto, again.\n\nI also downloaded Robinhood back in April, which sat at a -20% from shitty stocks I bought. In August I found Wallstreetbets. Got a bit obsessed reading the memes there. I was avoiding reality by distracting myself, but I did bought some stuff and turned my profit to +50% by December.\n\nMy crypto made gains too. I think it was like 20% gain. I was happy, mostly bc I discovered Lazarus Naturals and took a lot of CBD pills(my antidepressants ran out) and I also vaped a lot more. I hit my goal weight for December 2020. I went back to school and didn't fail my first semester. I only checked my ledger once a week. I never looked at the charts.\n\nThen GME happened. I started looking at the charts, the news, etc everyday bc WSB made it seem like a revolution. Right after that, Doge mooned, then everything else.\n\nThat's when I fomoed a lot. I bought mostly Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the two stayed dormant when literally every other crypto mooned. During the December run, I sold half of my LINK and XLM into bitcoin at 31k. Had I not done it, I would've had a much higher profit. People who got into crypto in January that just bought random alts have made more profits than me. I was jealous, and started chasing pumps, to no avail. I invest more than I wanted in crypto. The $2k I made from GME also went into crypto, which is now sitting at a loss.(only counting that ones I bought since January)\n\nIt got worse that I peeped into the cryptocurrency discord. People were making 50x gains from leveraged trading. My portfolio has tripled, which is supposed to be a good thing. But it's upsetting when people who's been around for 2 weeks and calls crypto 'shares' made 10x gains from some alts they knew nothing about, while you hold heavy bags that hardly move. I was especially upset when I was gonna buy BNB at $100 but never did. Not it's $280 or something.\n\nToday was a sign. A few days ago I signed up for [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) for the $25 bonus. I realized I had to buy and stake 5000 CRO to get the bonus, for a card I don't really need, so I declined. Today the price shot up as you can see. So far it's up 87%. I fomo'd in, but my bank declined the purchase, which was a good thing bc, like I said, I don't really need the card.\n\nSo I'm taking this as a wake-up call. I'm going to leave reddit temporarily, discord forever, uninstall Coingecko, etc. I will not come back until I have finished my 2nd semester, which ends on June 30th. I'm only coming back for my Zilliqa which is stuck in Binance for a few more day.\n\nAt the meantime, I'm going to try to accelerate and finish college, get a part time job, etc. I'm going to get my life back on track. I've put in $13k into crypto($11k before December and $2k fomo these few weeks). I only got $1k in fiat left in my bank. I'm not going to put in any more money. If all crypto went to zero, then it'll be a $13k lesson. If not, then it'd be a nice surprise after I finish my semester.\n\nI'm blocking reddit now. I'll see you in June.\n\nedit: thanks for all the well wishes! and for the 'c u tomorrow' guy, yeah hopefully not lol bc I want to finish school first. I'm also gonna try to reconnect with my friends and go out more again. They know my mental health issues so hopefully they'll understand.\n\nI wont uninstall the app bc i don't wanna lose my vault again lol. so im turning off my notifications. See you all in June! :)",
