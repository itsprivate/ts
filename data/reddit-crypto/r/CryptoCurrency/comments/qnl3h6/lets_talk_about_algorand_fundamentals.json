Fixed supply that will dry up in about 2030 (but probably earlier), so prices will rise as more dApps use it and it becomes scarcer. </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;There&#39;s only so many relay nodes, so it&#39;s centralized&quot; - To run a relay node, it requires a large amount of computing power. So the Algorand foundation limits relay nodes to operators who can afford it. There are ~ 100 relay node operators, so that&#39;s still fairly decentralized. This will grow in time. See this post for more info - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pq8bgn/how_are_algorands_relay_nodes_centralized/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pq8bgn/how_are_algorands_relay_nodes_centralized/</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;There&#39;s no dApps&quot; - The chain is only 2 years old, and we already have exciting projects like Tinyman, Yieldly, and Lofty.ai. <em>Many</em> more exist or are in development </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;There&#39;s clawback and freezing features&quot; - Yes, but only for 3rd party ASAs and CBDCs that opt-into it. Clawback and freezing does not exist on the main ALGO chain. Your keys, your tokens. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And there&#39;s a ton more features and benefits to this chain that I don&#39;t have room to list here (Silvio!). But overall, Algorand is a bright new blockchain with a ton of growth and potential. Check it out if you&#39;re a developer or looking for a solid medium to long-term play.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
