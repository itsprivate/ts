If you don't know what Brave is: a chromium based browser that blocks ads and instead has it's own non targeting ads that you get paid for and can tip to content creators you like.\n\nThe browser has built-in crypto wallets but accumulating ad revenue in them and contributing to content creators is an automatic process: you only need to use them to withdraw. Chances are that at this point people have become interested in the underlying blockchain tech powering it. For many of us our crypto journey started like this, because everyone has to start somewhere. This is contrary to many other tech in crypto that may not be that easy to use initially for no-coiners. \n\nI have recommended the browser to about 10 friends and many of them liked it, mainly for its speed, looks and privacy focus. Maybe only one of those 10 will eventually become interested in crypto because of Brave but I think that's already great. So in a sense it's the perfect gateway into crypto (at least better than doge). \n\nThanks for reading and hope you have a nice day, cheers.",
