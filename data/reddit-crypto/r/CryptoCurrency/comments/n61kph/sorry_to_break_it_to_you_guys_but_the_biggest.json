Amazon will take care of that for you.\n* Millions were forced not to work, but don’t worry: Congress decided to conjure $4 trillion out of thin air and give it to their ~~constituents~~ foreign countries and “foundations.” \n\nWe all got to see the ultra-wealthy double, triple, and exponentially multiply their net worths while simple folk and small business owners were thrown in the dirt and kicked in the teeth...“For their own safety” of course.\n\nAnd what happens when people decide to rally together and maybe try to make a few dollars via the stock market? Well for course the wealthy guys band together and shut them down (looking at you and your GME antics, RobinHood): finance laws be damned! Don’t worry though, their pals in congress will do a little bit of finger wagging for the cameras but don’t expect any real consequences. They’ll still get richer.\n\nWhat’s that? Too many people are getting a bit of well-deserved wealth after being forced  into poverty over the last year and a half? I guess we’ll double the capital gains tax! Right Joe? \n\nGuess what guys: 20/21 have seen the greatest wealth transfer in the history of world, and it didn’t go from the top down.\n\nLet’s hope crypto offers at least a bit of shelter from the oncoming shit-storm...because I’m convinced it’s only just getting started.",
