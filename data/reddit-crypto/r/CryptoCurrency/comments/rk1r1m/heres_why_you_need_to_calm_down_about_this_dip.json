Even in this dip, BTC is at $47k, ETH is $3900, SOL is $180, ADA is $1.26, DOT is $25.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about losing money in crypto, remember why you started. You likely saw the potential and the long term trends and wanted to buy in. The potential is still there and starting to become reality. Don’t panic, don’t sell for a loss, HODL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I accidentally said DOT was $5 instead of $25, fixed it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
