But as I watched at the chart after five days I wasn&amp;#39;t nervous or affraid. I was confused why we had this crash/dip and that&amp;#39;s about it. I did invest an amount I theoretically could lose and still live my life as it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I am challenging you guys to do the same: Don&amp;#39;t look at chart for a few days. I&amp;#39;ll say: 24. till 26. December. No Cryptorelated subreddit, no Charts. Do other stuff. Go on a rollercoaster as it&amp;#39;s literally the same as Crypto charts. Spend time with your family or related ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
