This experience has allowed me to gain knowledge on various crypto projects, some of which worked out well and others which unfortunately went wrong.</p>\n\n<p>So from my perspective, I make every month basically enough to only get by - with rent, housing expenses, college fees and everything I pretty much have no disposable income to invest in crypto. This leads me to a very hard situation, in which I some times forsee that some projects are likely to give me a good financial return, but I cannot afford to invest n them. Seeing them pump in the future simply takes a toll on my happiness, as I know that hypothetical income would mean the world to me. Investing in projects that don&#39;t work out would also mean that I would have to eat ramen everyday for the entirety of the month. </p>\n\n<p>Do any of you face the same issue? How do you personally handle it?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to those who read all of it :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
