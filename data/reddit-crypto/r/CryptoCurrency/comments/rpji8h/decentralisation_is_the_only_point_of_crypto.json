  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of a debate on this subreddit about the role of decentralisation in crypto. I believe that decentralisation is the &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; point of crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Store of Value - Gold&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Payoneer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investment opportunities - Stock market&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NFTs - ownership papers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I’m not an XMR shill I promise)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’m missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to “allow” you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees,  and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralisation gives fundamental value, other features enhance that value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
