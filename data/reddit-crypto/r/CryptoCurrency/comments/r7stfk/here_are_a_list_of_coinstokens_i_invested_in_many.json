Since I bought a majority of my crypto a while ago I left it for some time and recently reviewed much of it to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t need to do anything. Several needed attention (chain swaps, upgrades, etc) and it was a good exercise to make sure my Ledgers were updated, confirm private key and recovery phrases. In doing so I was reminded of this slew of crap that I didn&amp;#39;t know better about back in the day.

DYOR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Edit, so back in the day should be clarified. I first got in to crypto in 2013. I think a lot of this happened around 2015 or 2016. The whole game was quite different back then. But throwing a bunch of cheap darts at the wall to see what sticks was a diversification strategy. It was a small percentage of my holdings at the time. Sure, it would be nice to all be winners but it was also a fun and exciting time to be throwing crypto around. A mythical time before hardware wallets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
