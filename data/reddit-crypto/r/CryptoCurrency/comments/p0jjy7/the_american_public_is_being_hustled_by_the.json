This reaction even stronger than the last because this amendment is so much worse than the other one (I won&#39;t get into why in this post). Suddenly everyone is suggesting that we call our representatives and ask for Proposal 1. Look at the most recent posts about the amendments from before Proposal 2 was released and then after.</p>\n\n<p>HUSTLED. Congress quite obviously created Proposal 2 as an <em>anchor,</em> in order to get the public on board with Proposal 1. Keep in mind, not many people were a fan of Proposal 1 before Proposal 2 came out, and now people have accepted Proposal 1. This is negotiations 101, and you just got served.</p>\n\n<p>It took our government 24 hours to create an anchor point and immediate shift the mood on Proposal 1, which was their goal to pass in the first place. If you think that Congress is not aware of what they are doing, I suggest you pay closer attention to how our legislative branch works.</p>\n\n<p>It is not too late, call your representatives. Vote NO on Proposal 1 &amp; 2. Don&#39;t let our <em>elected leaders</em> hustle their constituents.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
