But when it goes really mainstream, I think that other people wont share that kind of enthusiasm with us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still buy products from companies that exploit poor and vulnerable. We will order from Amazon even though we say &amp;quot;fuck amazon&amp;quot; in the same breath. We buy shoes and branded shirts made in Bangladesh by women who work there for a few dollars a week. We buy phones that are made in Foxconn by workers who don&amp;#39;t even have basic human rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you really think that consumers will care whether their crypto is centralized or decentralized? They won&amp;#39;t. They will use the solution that will save them the most money and will be the most profitable. If it&amp;#39;ll cost $100 to buy something with a super decentralized crypto and $80, I would bet that most if not all people would go the cheapest route.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
