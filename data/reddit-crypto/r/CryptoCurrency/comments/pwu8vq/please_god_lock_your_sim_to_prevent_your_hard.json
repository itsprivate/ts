This means they can typically access your exchanges and crypto with the combined info from the hack and the phone access. </p>\n\n<p>For IOS all you have to so it go to cellular, sim pin, and slide the slider right and enter your pin.   If you don’t know it just contact your service provider and they can do it for you.  If you’ve already locked yourself out with attempts they can still set it up for you.  </p>\n\n<p>What this does (for most providers) is make your provider contact you and obtain a verbal confirmation of your pin along with a second layer of verification.  It isn’t completely unhackable but is a much bigger barrier to hacking your stuff. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: don’t lose your crypto to a sim swap, turn on your sim PIN requirement, it is super easy and fast (instructions for IOS above).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
