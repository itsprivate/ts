If you don’t watch it now, you should rewatch it later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will give you an insight into who does and doesn’t completely understand the subject within our government who is controlling the future of crypto. Some Congress members are concerned payments will take place to skirt sanctions against Cuba and how his mom wrote a book on how she got out of communist Cuba. Some are still worried about energy consumption of mining while reading off some bullet points they pulled up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some, some understand how this can lead to the future. The future of the development of Web 3.0. The future of payment processing on a public ledger and banking the unbanked. These are the government members that deserve our admiration for helping push the US into the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it seems like everyone is ripping on the SEC. Gary doesn’t seem to have a lot of friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
