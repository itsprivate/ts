And counter what the downvoters are doing.\n\nHelp those well written and informative posts get out of fresh, so many more people who might enjoy and be helped by them get to see the posts in rising or even hot.

I see a lot of  comments saying the downvotes are because of horrible advice/shitcoins/dogecoin/self storys, but the % are based on posts from hot, not those 'shit' posts. Just go to any given post that is a guide for beginners, very well written and full of info and check the average % of downvotes.**\n\n**EDIT 2: I also see alot of comments saying it is because we are a much broader subreddit than coin specific subreddits. I agree on this point and definetly get what you are saying, but have you ever posted something? Sometimes I post something that takes at least 5 minutes to read and im at - 5 votes within 5 seconds of posting it. Either they read really fast, or they are just scrolling fresh and downvote whatever is posted. And again I ask you to check the % on very informative posts made by the community for the community, just see for yourself.**",
