But lemme just write a post saying I got HACKED and METAMASK SUXXXX!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For fuck&amp;#39;s sake, most of the people that lost their crypto money got SCAMMED, not HACKED. Did someone suddenly invent a quantum computer capable of breaking SHA-256 cryptography? Because that&amp;#39;s literally what it takes to &amp;#39;hack&amp;#39; your crypto wallet without your seed phrase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole point of crypto is that NOBODY, no MACHINE, no CIA, no NSA, no Illuminati, no Bogdanoff can HACK your crypto wallet, that&amp;#39;s the whole fucking point of crypto ffs. So you can fucking imagine why ppl start to panic when some rando Wojaks that got scammed like a noob but cries out loud how he got &amp;#39;hacked&amp;#39;. Then everyone starts to think &amp;#39;what if this happened to me????&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;does this mean Ledger and Metamask are not safu??&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If only people could be clear and write out step by step what actually happened and stop spreading these bullshit fear stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
