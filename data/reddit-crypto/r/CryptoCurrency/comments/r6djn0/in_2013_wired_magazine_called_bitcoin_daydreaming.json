The world&amp;#39;s most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction. So we&amp;#39;re destroying the private key used by our Bitcon wallet. That leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity – or at least until someone cracks the SHA-256 encryption that secures it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/05/butterfly-live/\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nWallet:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BYsmmrrfTQ1qm7KcrSLxnX7SaKQREPYFP\"&gt;1BYsmmrrfTQ1qm7KcrSLxnX7SaKQREPYFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
