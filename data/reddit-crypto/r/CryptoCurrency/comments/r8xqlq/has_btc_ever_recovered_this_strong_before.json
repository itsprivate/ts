It’s crazy how quickly things can change in this market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we’ll drop a bit more again before we hit 50k but to me this seems incredibly bullish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think will happen next? Was this just the shakeout before the next rise? Could the 100k btc by eoy predictions still be valid? Would love to know what everyone’s thinking now!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
