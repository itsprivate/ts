They confirmed unclaimed moons are considered <strong>permanently lost</strong> and will never re-enter orbit or count towards total supply. Because of this the theoretical supply cap of 250 million will never be hit. </p>\n\n<p>Currently ~45 million moons have gone unclaimed. The circulating supply is close to 65 million but the total available to claim at this point is ~110 million.</p>\n\n<p>Shoutout to <a href=\"/u/IHaventEvenGotADog\">u/IHaventEvenGotADog</a> for noticing the discrepancy in <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mp0vfx/i_ran_the_moon_numbers_can_someone_check_because/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">this post</a> with detailed spreadsheets three months ago. <a href=\"https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xf912b3d9a7ca389d9c9f6210efa1d36af4eecb345cb49d102334485561080841\">+250 moons for your effort</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I’m going to use this opportunity to propose we refer to the circulating supply of moons as the “orbiting supply”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
