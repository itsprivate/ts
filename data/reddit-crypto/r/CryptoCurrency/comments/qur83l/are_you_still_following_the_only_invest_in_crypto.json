Over the past few months I&#39;ve noticed that I seem to only apply that to investments in non-blue chips. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I won&#39;t have to sell my house if the market crashes and I don&#39;t mess with leverage, but I just don&#39;t feel like BTC/ETH/LINK and a few others (probably ALGO, maybe Moons) are at a very high risk of going to zero.</p>\n\n<p>It may be stupid or naïve of me, but it feels like there&#39;s so much more institutional support and news coverage for the big names than there used to be that a 100% loss on those couple of coins feels unlikely. I&#39;m still following the old rule for ERG/MATIC/ONE/TIME/etc. though. Is anybody else doing this too? Am I just an idiot who&#39;s on a path that leads to selling both kidneys? I understand the audience that&#39;s going to read this, but I&#39;m here for the confirmation bias, not sound financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
