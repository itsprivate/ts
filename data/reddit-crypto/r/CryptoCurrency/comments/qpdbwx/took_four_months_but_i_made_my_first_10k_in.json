  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I started investing in crypto in July with $10,000, and as of today, my earnings are well over that. If my portfolio were to keep growing at this rate, I&#39;ll be a millionaire in 7/2023, and a billionaire by 12/2026! üò± Here are some quick observations in no particular order:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) The more you can start with, the more potential you have to earn.</strong> This is pretty straightforward. It doesn&#39;t have to be $10,000, but giving yourself as solid a foundation to begin is pretty helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) DCA weekly and HODL.</strong> I DCA a decent chunk of change every week. I chose weekly, because I&#39;d forget to do it daily, and monthly seems like too long in between. I don&#39;t have the time or the skill to mess around with a lot of day trading, so I just buy and HODL. This seems to be a pretty decent strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) BTC and ETH are kings, but other coins have value, too.</strong> My portfolio is roughly forty percent BTC, forty percent ETH, and twenty percent other coins. I have some dog money for fun, but not too much.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4) Don&#39;t panic, and don&#39;t FOMO (too much).</strong> Crypto is super volatile sometimes, so it&#39;s helpful not to panic when the value drops, and it&#39;s probably a good idea not to give in too much to FOMO when it drops, too. Consistency is boring, but it works.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5) Have a goal in mind.</strong> This seems to help. I don&#39;t want a Lambo, but I do want a new Wrangler and an oceanfront house here in Hawai ªi. A condo in Chicago would be nice, too. And Paris. And maybe Singapore. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And I don&#39;t really want to fly economy ever again if I can help it. Lol</p>\n\n<p><strong>6) Staking is a good move.</strong> This is basically free money, so why wouldn&#39;t you?</p>\n\n<p>(OK, that&#39;s six takeaways.)</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it. Probably pretty obvious, but maybe someone will find this helpful. I&#39;m eager to see what happens in another four months, four years, forty years. Glad to respond to questions or comments when I can today, but ultimately just wanted to share this milestone. May not be much to some, but it&#39;s pretty significant to me. Aloha!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
