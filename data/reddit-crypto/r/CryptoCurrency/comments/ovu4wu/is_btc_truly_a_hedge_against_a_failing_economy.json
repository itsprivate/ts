BTC offers an economic lifeline to those in, e.g., Venezuela, who experienced +65,000% inflation in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>But what about in developed nations? Is there any evidence for this assertion?</p>\n\n<p>Historically, BTC&#39;s correlation to traditional assets has been low to non-existent, as tabulated and visualised below:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>Year</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2020</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2019</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2018</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2017</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2016</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2015</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2014</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>2013</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.22</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.09</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>U.S. Bonds</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.07</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.06</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Gold</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.34</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.14</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.02</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.07</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.08</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>U.S. Real Estate</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.17</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.09</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.01</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Oil</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.23</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.02</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.06</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Emerging Market Currencies</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.25</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.02</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.07</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.07</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.04</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.03</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-0.07</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f78ysycyhre71.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f386fad5d1a75ae7bfb38bb9d9e5a360de2b4d24\">Annual correlation to BTC. Source: VanEck, Feb 2021.</a></p>\n\n<p>However, in 2020, this correlation began to strengthen - with BTC now displaying, in particular, a moderate correlation (0.34) to Gold (a classical hedge). Interestingly, these correlations, so far, have weakened in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>To put this into perspective, the S&amp;P 500 showed a correlation to U.S. Real Estate and Oil of 0.73 and 0.34 respectively (between 2012-2020).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: BTC typically moves independently of the wider economy, as expected for a niche and nascent market. But as institutional investment increases and the space grows, this may no longer be true going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean you can safely ignore the wider economy? <strong>NO!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The above data shows <em>global</em> correlations. BTC has and will always show <em>local</em> correlations:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vctr37h2jre71.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c31c5f8dcd42daa67c2c19a7b88ac761502208be\">Correlation between S&amp;P 500 and BTC. March-August 2020 i.e. COVID-19.</a></p>\n\n<p>There is no causation here. The S&amp;P 500 and BTC simply respond to the same macro-economic stimuli - inflation/liquidity injections, world events (e.g. COVID-19) and so forth. <strong>In times of economic uncertainty, people will liquidate assets regardless of what those assets are.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also important to remember that BTC was created in response to the last, significant crash (2008). BTC will be battle-tested now going into 2022 - arguably for the first time - as the full effects of COVID-19 and reckless federal reserve policy hit.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, if the economy crashes, so will BTC. There is no way around that - the economy will take everything with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is BTC truly a hedge against a failing economy?</strong> IMO, not yet or it remains to be seen, but it has potential. This subreddit is an echo chamber and it&#39;s easy to have tunnel-vision when investing in crypto - as if no other economies or assets exist. My advice to you is to avoid this, educate yourselves and keep an eye on the wider economy. It <em>will</em> affect your portfolio.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
