An estimated 4 million Bitcoins have been lost forever. The number is significant, considering that only 21 million BTCs will ever be mined. Experts believe that over 20 percent of the lost coins cannot be retrieved.</p>\n\n<p>Scary, right? How does something like this happen?</p>\n\n<p>The BTC blockchain is immutable and irreversible. This means that once a transaction is completed, it cannot be canceled or reverted. If you send your crypto assets to the wrong wallet, they are gone.</p>\n\n<p>The cryptography used to secure these coins has no empathy. It doesn’t care if you are on the verge of having a heart attack. If you do not use the correct key, you will not access the wallet. Maybe a quantum computer could crack a private key, but decades may pass before it happens. Besides, it may not be possible even with the next generation of computers because developers are already working on creating quantum-proof solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting story of lost BTC - In 2013, James Howells, who lives in Wales, threw out a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins on it. When he realized how much the value of Bitcoin had shot up in recent years, he went looking for the drive. Now, he’s trying to get his local city council to allow him to excavate the landfill in an attempt to find the drive. He’s claiming to offer a portion of the proceeds if the city allows him to look through the trash.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/2qvkolB\">Calculation Of Lost BTCs</a></p>\n\n<p>Study by - <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/\">Chainalysis</a></p>\n\n<p>Ps - Please backup your Reddit vault atleast and write the recovery phrase somewhere !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
