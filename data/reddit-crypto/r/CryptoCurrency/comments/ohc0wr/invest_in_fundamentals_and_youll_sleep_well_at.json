You understand farming and you have a general idea of what your farm is worth, and you also have a crazy alcoholic neighbor who keeps offering you a different price for your farm each day.  Why would you sell your farm to your neighbor just because you think that he&#39;ll offer you a lower price tomorrow?  Why would you buy your neighbor&#39;s farm just because you think that he&#39;ll ask for a higher price tomorrow?  It&#39;s the wrong mindset.</p>\n\n<p>Do your research.  Does your coin have a working product, a solid use-case, and a team you can trust?  Is it at a price below what you believe its actual value to be, or to be in the future?  That&#39;s how you know whether to buy or not, and then it doesn&#39;t really matter how the market shifts.  You just wait until your coin is at or above what you think it is fundamentally worth and then you sell.  Simple :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
