There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I&amp;#39;ll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won&amp;#39;t let me create a post with that many coin names in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f8qk6b7urf781.png?width=873&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a0c982ec7c5e72119b0f61252fbb9b23b2823a9\"&gt;The Folio of Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
