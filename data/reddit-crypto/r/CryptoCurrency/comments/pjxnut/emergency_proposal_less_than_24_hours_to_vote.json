The user has since confirmed as much in a message to the moderation team. You may know this user as:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Hame_BiH\">u/Hame_BiH</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/u/TDavid13\">u/TDavid13</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/u/DestroRe13\">u/DestroRe13</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/u/mahatmadandi\">u/mahatmadandi</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/u/Obito_DOS3\">u/Obito_DOS3</a>  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Over the course of the previous distributions, this user has been given a total of 138,733 moons - which should have been spread fairly around the community of users here that earns them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>While this user and all accounts have been permanently banned, the timing of the bans means that the 5,655 moons marked for distribution will still be paid out on the 8th September unless a poll passes.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We have very strict rules on using multiple accounts to bypass the karma cap, or otherwise game the system in an effort to earn more moons.  Rule 3 is &quot;No Manipulation&quot; and that counts for bypassing Governance rules for the subreddit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is not fair for the rest of the users who are following the rules to have these moons distributed for ill-gotten karma, especially not over several accounts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the moons these accounts have received cannot be recovered (the beauty of trustless, blockchain technology) but we can at least act now to prevent this final distribution from rewarding this user for their bad-faith posting. If this karma is removed from the distribution, the current ratio will increase, giving each and every user more moons for their karma this round  This will be a record-setting poll if it passes, and it is a long shot.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>By this poll passing, it will remove the above accounts from the current distribution, ensuring they do not receive the final moons allocated for their posts in snapshot 17. The methodology to address problem users has been laid out by Reddit admins.</p>\n\n<p>An additional effect of the poll passing will be less karma in the pool, meaning the Karma:Moons ratio goes up - more moons for everyone!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/pjxnut\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
