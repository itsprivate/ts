However, they don’t pay out in terms of crypto, they pay in the current dollar amount of crypto. So no matter what price a certain crypto is currently trading at, you will earn $3 of the crypto at the current price.\n\nBecause of this, you should only complete these tasks during dips because you will get more coins and therefore have more room for growth. Hope this helps somebody!\n\nEdit: Some people have pointed out that the awards expire after a certain time/number of people completing it. So maybe the only real tip is, if you see that the market is down one day, use it as an excuse to do any rewards you can, cuz it’s a good time to do them :)",
