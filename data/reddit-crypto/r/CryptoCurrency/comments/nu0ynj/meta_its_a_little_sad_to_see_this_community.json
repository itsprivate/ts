There was 8 hours of live streamed content every day. People discussed topics like\n\n- Macro economics\n\n- Mining and green mining\n\n- Market structure and how to invest safely\n\n- Morality of Crypto and driving sentiment\n\n- Growth and Adoption\n\n- On chain analytics\n\n- BTC for billions, NOT billionaires\n\n- How to build a BTC bank\n\n- Banking the unbanked\n\n- History of money\n\n- How to profitably mine at home\n\n- Fiat Fascism VS Bitcoin Sovereignism\n\n- What to do if your country bans BTC\n\n- What happened in 1971\n\n- How to avoid excess taxes on BTC\n\n- How to make Texas BTC friendly\n\n- BTC ETFs\n\n- Lightening network and instant settlement\n\nOn top of all this we heard very inspiring stories about how BTC is changing lives around the world. Scott Harrison's clean water for Africa charity using BTC. \n\nJack Mallers was so emotional talking about El Salvador and how he believes switching to sound and hard money will help empower the underprivileged. It was inspiring to see how much he truly cares. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_59hrgTiRJU\n\nThere was SO MUCH good and quality stuff that came from this conference yet the r/cryptocurrency community is treating it like it's the enemy and not an ally bc some maxis pissed them off.  \n\nThe lesson here is to not fall for headlines. Similar to how you all looked passed the mass media FUD last month, I encourage you to look passed it again and see what really took place in Miami.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/BitcoinMagazine/videos\n\nAbove is the channel that posted each panel as a separate video so they're easier to find. I suggest some of you watch them and see how calm, educational, rational and interesting many of the panels were. \n\nLast thing- I can't find the clip (someone help) but the toxic maxi crowd was ridiculed by the panel that followed them and that got cheers from the crowd. Something that obviously won't go viral bc vitriol and mockery is entertaining, but truth isn't.",
