It establishes rule inequality- that a protocol is a protocol and that you have to comply with the rules no matter your stature.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAO, Defi, Dex, Dapps are the future which they are so desperately trying to resist in order to postpone its destined arrival. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when we push anything which is centralized in its core nature and hope for it to get widely adopted, we are working for them- those rotten, corrupt rich who are a part of this massive cartel looking for any opportunity that could help them horde this power that they are very well accustomed to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s hope that with new year, we work on the issues rampant in the current state of our world- glorified under this biggest ever investigative piece- and progress towards a better and more decentralized world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
