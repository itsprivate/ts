If you read the article you will see that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It's from March 12, not recent.\n2. Any \"proposed bill\" needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn't \"passed\".\n3. It's already dead on the Senate [as you can read here: \"Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, **died in chamber**](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021)\"\n4. The proposed bill intended to add a **16 point Financial Literacy course** to 10th and 11th graders **where one of them was cryptocurrency** [as you can see here.](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/199139)\n5. This is literally in the second paragraph of the original article: *According to the report, the bill aims to amend the current curriculum for 10th and 11th-grade students. The new program would consist of 16 new areas of financial literacy such as cryptocurrency, balancing a checking account, money management, making investments, and completing loan applications, among other traditional subjects.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEasy conclusion: Georgia is not teaching students about Crytocurrency. People will upvote whatever makes them feel good even though a simple reading of the article and a small amount of critical thinking would make them at least question the way the headline was written.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's be better :)",
