I can sit back and know that basically if ETH crashed to nothing now, Iâ€™ve not actually lost anything. Nobody ever went broke making a profit</p>\n\n<p>I think you have to put into perspective the gains youâ€™ve achieved agains things like the stock market where 9% is supposedly good! You donâ€™t have to strive for a 1000% gain or something.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m just sharing my perspective on this because yeah, whilst itâ€™s great to see your portfolio increase in value, it could just as easily come crashing down and you could be in a worse position that when you started. That literally isnâ€™t possible for me now because I took out my principal and stuck to my targets.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m going to sit back now, enjoy playing with my play money and if there are any significant drops, throw some money back in. ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
