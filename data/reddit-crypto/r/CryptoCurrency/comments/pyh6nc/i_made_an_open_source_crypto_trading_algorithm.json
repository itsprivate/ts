  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been nearly two months since I started working on this project and I feel like I&#39;m finally ready to run this live, as my testing showed this strategy to be profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what I learned during my time testing and developing this crypto trading bot:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The algorithm’s achievable minimum speed of execution is 0.1s. Anything quicker will incur a temp IP ban from the Binance API.</li>\n<li>The algorithm buys at the peak of the initial listing even at 0.1s of the coin being listed so buying it not profitable</li>\n<li>Margin sell orders work in theory, however in practice, most new coins are not immediately listed on margin/futures (found a workaround though)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With those findings in mind, I had to re-think the way the algorithm works and how it can take advantage of the price jump for initial coin listings on Binance. In case you&#39;re not familiar with the behaviour that I&#39;m referring to, have a look at this initial coin listing chart:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rzkkbuckdmq71.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74a73982c747e3e4e40f2e7599643a17bd0664a\">https://preview.redd.it/rzkkbuckdmq71.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74a73982c747e3e4e40f2e7599643a17bd0664a</a></p>\n\n<p>Most coins seem to experience a massive surge in their price at the moment of listing (usually lasts under 0.1 seconds).</p>\n\n<p>I first built this bot in order to exploit this phenomenon, but even with a minium achievable speed of 0.1 seconds, this was not profitable, as it was buying at the peak. So I decided to reverse the orders, by placing sell orders instead of buy. Lo and behold this is actually making money!</p>\n\n<p>11% profit on USDP listing (a stablecoin no less) and 50% profit on GALA.</p>\n\n<p>The testing showed that shorting coins at the moment of listing is actually profitable, now I just needed to find a way to actually do that when live.</p>\n\n<p>So I made it so that the tool sends you an e-mail when Binance announces that they will list a new coin. Giving you time to buy it from a different exchange and deposit it into your Binance account. The code will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s a video that I made which explains the history of the development, why it works the way it does and a potentially fully automated solution for the future:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qqXQgwuFI8s\"><strong>https://youtu.be/qqXQgwuFI8s</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Source code is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins/tree/buy_outside_binance\">https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins/tree/buy_outside_binance</a></p>\n\n<p>And finally, a guide on how to use it: <a href=\"https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/\">https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
