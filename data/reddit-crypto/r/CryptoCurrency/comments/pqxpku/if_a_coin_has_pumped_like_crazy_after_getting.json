It went from $9.81 to $47.85 and is at $17.99 today. See also <a href=\"https://www.coinspeaker.com/dfinity-icp-token-700-coinbase-pro/\">ICP</a> which went from $245 to $750 and trades for $58 today. Likewise, FARM (listed at the beginning of August) went from $135 to $438 and now trades for $206. </p>\n\n<p>These coins pump for a couple of weeks before listing too. If you can manage to be lucky enough to buy in before the listing, go for it. Might get lucky and have it pump, although they do sometimes dump right away. If it’s listed and going crazy, you might want to stay away.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
