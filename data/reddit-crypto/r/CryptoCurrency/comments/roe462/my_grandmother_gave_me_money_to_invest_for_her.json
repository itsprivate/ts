I know how crypto works, I&amp;#39;ve invested before, just not a really big fan of it or have a ton of experience. I was planning on putting $500 into Ethereum, and the other $500 split between various alt coins. Is that smart? Or should I put more into Ethereum or bitcoin and ignore the alt coins completely? She said she doesn&amp;#39;t want to know about it for a couple of years so short term losses aren&amp;#39;t important. Also don’t know if I should wait to invest it or just go all in now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: should have mentioned that my brothers also got $1000 to invest so I have to prove that I’m better than them&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
