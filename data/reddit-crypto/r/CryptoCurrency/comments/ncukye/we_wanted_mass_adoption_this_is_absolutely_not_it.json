Please, don't. This is not what mass adoption and decentralization look like. This is just a person, basically the second richest man in the world, the 1% of the 1%, playing with the money of millions of people. That's just the contrary of what decentralization truly is. One of the main goals of decentralization, as u/spitefire said in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbyj5k/when_did_it_become_ok_in_peoples_eyes_to_allow/) is \n> to get the financial system back into the hands of the ordinary person and not controlled and influenced by the top 1%. \n\nSo, this is just the exact opposite of what cryptocurrencies stand for. Also, u/Gilgameshbrah pointed out how only 2% of the world population uses cryptocurrencies. And probably a good part of them don't understand how they work.,\n\nFurthermore, mass adoption doesn't mean people buying shitcoins. Those are just people looking at a way to make easy money, they don't care about the projects or about the underlying technology behind those coins, or tokens, and that's why most shitcoins lack in fundamentals. \n\nMass adoption means people will start using cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies because they have a huge amount of potential in changing our societies, in changing our economics and in changing our world. Using this technology means to democratize our financial system in order to reduce inequalities, in order to take back our privacy and in order to finally take back our money.\n\nFor me this technology is a gateway for a fairer world. So, this is not mass adoption and this is not decentralization, at all. This is the exact opposite. So, fuck that and fuck the people that think that.",
