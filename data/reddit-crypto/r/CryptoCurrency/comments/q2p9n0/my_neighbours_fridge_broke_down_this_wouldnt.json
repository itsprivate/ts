Being broke that I am because all my money’s invested in ADA, she used to let me store leftovers and meat. It was a good fridge, but one thing missing from it was blockchain. If only it was decentralised. It wouldn’t go down. Would have better governance. It would save the word by fixing world hunger. It would’ve provided infrastructure to help impoverished countries store report cards and school ids. It would’ve allowed ordinary people finally get mobile connectivity, because the technology is not invented yet. It would’ve prevented money laundering and tax evasion by the rich and powerful. It would’ve democratised retail investment into cute canine coins. Bitcoin is going 60k soon. Will sell some dog coins and get a new fridge. Give me some moons too.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
