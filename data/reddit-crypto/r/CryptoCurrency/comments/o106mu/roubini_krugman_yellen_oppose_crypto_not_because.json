The real reason why all these people against crypto is not their age (or being part of previous generation). In short, these people are so against crypto because they are statists to the core.\n\nFor example, Nouriel Roubini, Paul Krugman and Janet Yellen are followers of New Keynesian economics. It's even in their bio in Wikipedia (check \"School or tradition\" section). The only way for them to accept crypto is to completely throw away their Keynesianism because it's inherently statist. That's not going to happen and it has nothing to do with their age or generation but with their desire for state controlled economy.\n\nFurthermore, one of godfathers of crypto is actually Friedrich Hayek who wrote famous book called \"The Denationalization of Money\" in 1976:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Denationalization\\_of\\_Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money)\n\nHere is a short video with quotes from Hayek:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI)\n\nBy the time, he gave this interview (1984), he was 85 years old man and he was way ahead of his time!\n\nCryptocurrencies are just modern embodiment of almost century old debate - Keynes vs. Hayek.\n\nMilton Friedman also predicted rise of cryptocurrencies (he called them - anonymous e-cash):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwxdyLnMXM#t=14m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwxdyLnMXM#t=14m40s)\n\nHe gave this interview (1999) when he was 87 years old.\n\nTimothy May wrote his famous essay called \"The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\" in 1988. This essay had a big influence on Wei Dai:\n\n[http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt)\n\nBy the way, this essay is the first link in original Bitcoin whitepaper. Timothy May would turn 70 this year. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018.\n\nEven long before, Hayek and Friedman, Carl Menger wrote free market theory of money called \"On the Origins of Money\" (1892).\n\nIn short, crypto can't be inherently generational thing because its philosophical/economical foundation created by 100+ year old men (if they were still alive today). The real reason why all these modern \"economists\" oppose crypto is because they are statist to the core and they will never accept the idea that something can exist outside of state control (especially money!).\n\nSo real debate isn't between generations but between different schools of thought and free market theory of money is very old idea which found itself in cyberspace.",
