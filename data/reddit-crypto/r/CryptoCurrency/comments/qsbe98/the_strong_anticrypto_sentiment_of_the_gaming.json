Any attempt to clear up misconceptions or pro-crypto comments are downvoted to oblivion making it impossible to have a real conversation or debate.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If people who play videogames are anti-crypto because it is wasteful from an energy perspective we have a long way to go in terms of acceptance and mass adoption.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the downvoting brigade we should get out there and make good, coherent points to try and clear up misconceptions and provide the bull case for crypto. Even if they don&#39;t want to hear it. Crypto is going to be an important part of future virtual technology, even in videogames.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yes there are scummy NFT games out there, yes there is room for improvement to the energy efficiency of crypto, but no that doesn&#39;t mean all blockchain applications are bad or wasteful.  We should accept criticism, point out how technology will adapt in those areas, and put forth valid use cases for why crypto is valuable to society.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
