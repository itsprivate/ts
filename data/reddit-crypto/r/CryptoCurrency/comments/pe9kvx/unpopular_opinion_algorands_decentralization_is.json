From their marketing page:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Algorand uses cryptographic sortition to select users to propose blocks for a given round. When a block is proposed to the blockchain, a committee of voters is selected to vote on the block proposal. If a super majority of the votes are from honest participants, the block can be certified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What they fail to mention is the backroom selection of the validator nodes that actually run the network. Let&#39;s suppose the user proposing the block is truly random. How do they propose a block? Specifically, how does the user that owns the selected Algo token have any influence over how the block is proposed? So far as I can tell, the user has no real agency; in contrast, other delegating PoS chains like Tezos or Cardano let the user directly delegate their block proposal responsibility to a baker or stake pool, respectively. By choosing the baker/pool to whom I delegate, I do my part in ensuring the decentralization of the network. In turn, bakers/pools are incentivized to act in the best interest if the network in order to attract and retain delegators.</p>\n\n<p>The responsibility to select validators is a critical element in decentralization. The fact is, as an Algo holder I have no influence over the network. Instead, the network is run by a secret list of validators, owned and operated by &quot;early backers.&quot; What guarantees do we have that those validators hold (and will continue to hold) the health of the network as highest priority? For all we know, Algorand could be a long con with a charismatic (and qualifed) figurehead.</p>\n\n<p>This critical flaw calls into serious question the long term value of the Algorand project. I choose not to use BSC for the same reason (centralization). At least BSC doesn&#39;t lie about being decentralized - their solution to the Trilemma is to sacrifice all decentralization in favor of speed (and presumably security). Algorand claims to be decentralized, but so far as I can tell it&#39;s all smoke and mirrors.</p>\n\n<p>This sub has a lot of Algo supporters. To you I say: change my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I hold some Algo, but I&#39;m much more interested and invested in decentralized chains: Ethereum, Tezos, and Cardano (and learning about more as my time permits).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
