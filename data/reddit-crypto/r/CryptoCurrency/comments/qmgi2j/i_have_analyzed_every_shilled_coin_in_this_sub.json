In <strong>2020</strong> it <strong>lost value significantly</strong>, which means maybe after this bull run, it won&#39;t give any ROI anymore. Still hard to analyze with only 1 year of history</li>\n<li><strong>Axie Infinity, Solana, Kusama,  Polkadot, Helium, Aave, Avalanche, Pancakeswap, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Injective Protocol, Arweave</strong> all were <em>ICOed</em> in 2020, and in a span of <strong><em>1,5 years</em></strong> they gave insane returns, if they continue with the same pace, you can <strong><em>10x</em></strong> your money in the future</li>\n<li><strong>AMP</strong> <em>ICOed</em> in 2020 and is <strong><em>the only coin</em></strong> in this table that gave <strong><em>consistent negative returns</em></strong></li>\n<li>Our beloved <strong>Algorand</strong> have a negative <strong><em>ROI</em></strong> from the <em>ICO</em>, but if you were buying the dip, you should be good</li>\n<li><strong>Litecoin</strong> is like a little brother of Bitcoin that doesn&#39;t get any toys. It gives consistent positive ROI but compared to others, it is really little return</li>\n<li><strong>Technically almost every coin has pumped at least 500% this year</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
