Back then, crypto wasn’t as popular as it is now, not even close. However, I decided to make the project about blockchain technology and Bitcoin. Which by the time I thought it was super interesting as well as innovative. I spent the whole year studying blockchain and crypto, talking with professionals and doing what I thought that was a really good project.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the day I presented my work, the teachers told me that it was cool, but not a good topic for a big project since it was “irrelevant” and “useless” I remember that they would keep asking “if it’s so good, why is it that nobody is using it?” and some other dumb questions that made it clear they didn’t understand what was its true goal. I got a 5/10 and got really mad since I spent so much time and I really needed a good mark.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, yesterday I met one of the teachers that I haven’t seen in years in the grocery store. The first thing he told me was that everyday he wishes he bought bitcoin back in 2015 when I first introduced to him. Then, I told him that he can still buy bitcoin now since it still has a lot of potential, but he thought he missed the train already. This made me realize that a lot of people wish they had bought bitcoin in 2015 or before, but won’t realize that in 2030 or later the will wish they had bought bitcoin in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: The next best time to buy bitcoin/crypto is now. If you wish you had bought bitcoin under 100$, you will wish you had bought bitcoin at 50.000$ when it reaches 500.000$ in 5-10 years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
