Of course I was sure it was gonna do the same once again soon. Then came the bear and winter was coming. On the way down I sold a good portion of my bags and felt like the biggest loser ever. Taking profits far away from the peak really did hurt, although I was still above the 100x area. When ETH reached 85$ I felt good for having sold at least a part of my holdings way above that price and at the same time I was sure the rest would slowly but steadily die off to zero. But I hodled.</p>\n\n<p>Now, with all that uncertainty on the short term horizon, I&#39;ll do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I was asked to prove it. Here&#39;s my first ever Ethereum transaction, that I made a cuple of days after I bought my ETH bag: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd108fe7e03f1c57328f0e1c1258c17b5cab1b7b1ae5e3a1cc0c69caed83297e\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd108fe7e03f1c57328f0e1c1258c17b5cab1b7b1ae5e3a1cc0c69caed83297e</a> I can&#39;t remember what for, but I sent a cuple of eth off of poloniex. Probably a test transaction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
