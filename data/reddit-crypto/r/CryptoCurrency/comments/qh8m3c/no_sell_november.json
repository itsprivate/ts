No Selling Allowed!  If you&#39;re up for the challenge, it&#39;s pretty simple. Just don&#39;t hit that damn sell button.  Market tanking? don&#39;t you even think about it.  Market surging, don&#39;t even think about it.  Just sit back, hold, and relax.  If you&#39;re feeling crazy, throw a few buy orders in or continue your normal DCA.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t meant to pump the market and I have no delusions that this will.  This is just a fun way to celebrate our love for Crypto and come together as a community. Could cause a supply shock if enough people really participate in this but that&#39;s not the point. If we want to stop shaving and hold off from you know what, you can do that too.</p>\n\n<p>No Sell November, folks. It&#39;s now a thing!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
