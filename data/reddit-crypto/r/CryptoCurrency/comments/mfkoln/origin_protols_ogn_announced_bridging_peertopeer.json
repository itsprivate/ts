This sparked a lot of attention in the music industry and showbiz in general, to the point that the team was invited to join some celebrities, famous industry professionals and influencers on clubhouse parties and other talks over NFTs topics (on their YouTube channel there is one with Kim Dotcom and  Paris Hilton :D ). Those days we could see with our eyes more and less famous music industry players literally entering their Telegram channels and Discord asking for collaborations and partnerships in order to replicate what they did for the record auction they managed for 3LAU.\n\nThey're maybe making it on the news for the NFTs now but something some people may not know is that they're also the same people behind [OUSD](https://www.ousd.com/), the first-ever stable coin that passively earns a yield without any action from users end -basically removing all the complexities with earning fees through lending or supplying liquidity to automated market makers-  apart of buying/minting the tokens and keep them in their wallets. In addition to a stable coin that we could consider like a saving account where you earn interests but also simultaneously still being in the position to spend your OUSD as soon as you decide to do so (no lock period), they're also working on \"implementing a new peer-to-peer payment app with an associated debit card built on top of OUSD, that combines the ease of peer-to-peer payments with a high-yield savings account that beats traditional savings accounts by a factor of 10 to 100x\".\n\nNow given that these were just a taste of a number of interesting concepts in the litepaer, that the team is made of [respectable well-known professionals](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/team) in the industry coming from companies such as PayPal, Google, YouTube etc, the above premises and everything in the litepaper, I am getting more and more interested in the future of this project.\n\nLast but not least, they grew it and still growing the project quite organically since 2017/2018, without any real advertising campaigns, as most of the crypto projects do instead in order to get quickly famous, but that is also something that often makes 'burn' and disappear those projects quickly.\n\nI hope this has got someone as interested as much as it has happened for me.   \nAs usual in these cases, DYOR ([here is the litepaper](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper) on their website), don't sleep too long on it though because big exposure has arrived, Sheldon Evans and Alex Becker are big in crypto and just spoke about OGN in these last 2 days [here](https://youtu.be/5p8LgjMQbyE?t=929) and [here](https://youtu.be/IO8gX4vPkRA?t=1106), it is really one step from getting among top coins, and you know what that means...understanding a project high value before the real boom is the key.",
