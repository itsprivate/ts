Research the shit out of coins you&amp;#39;re interested in and don&amp;#39;t send your coins to ANYONE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No investment is better than losing your investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treat your keys with extreme care and respect and get a hardware wallet. You are a bank now. Start acting like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
