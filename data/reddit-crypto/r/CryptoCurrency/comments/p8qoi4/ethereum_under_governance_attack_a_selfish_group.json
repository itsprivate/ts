In regular course, the miners are incentivised to act in the best interests of the protocol and retain this governance. However, with proof of stake merge cutting miners out, they are now acting in selfish interest. </p>\n\n<p>However, EGL now seeks to bribe miners to tokenize &amp; sell this control to the market instead, ignoring due process. Such a proposal will never pass EIP process, but now due to greedy miners this attempt at power grab is being played out. </p>\n\n<p>Miners are taking this step because of the upcoming proof of stake merge, that threatens to cut miners out of the picture. Hence, they are attempting to divest their control on the network in this fashion, by selling their governance out in collaboration with some rogue VC funds, and trying to seek rent on the governance process. </p>\n\n<p>The Ethereum team must make it clear that they don’t endorse this EGL project. People buying this in the market are just helping rouge miners cash out  and providing liquidity to bad actors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
