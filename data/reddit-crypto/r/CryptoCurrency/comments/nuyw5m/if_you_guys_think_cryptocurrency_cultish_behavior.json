It's so worthless, that most cannot even afford to save meaningful quantities of it fast enough to keep up with the rate that it loses value. Hell, in reality, most have to take credit just to get by because this thing loses value so fast. Some end up taking loans so large that they can never pay it off in a whole lifetime of work, making them in a sense serfs, or in other translations of the word serfdom: debt slaves.\n\nYou'd think people would realize their currency is shit when lifelong debt is oftentimes their only option to get a roof over their heads or an education, yet everyone in my country loves this paper dollar so much they can't see beyond the charade of its \"In God We Trust\" and cultish image inscriptions.",
