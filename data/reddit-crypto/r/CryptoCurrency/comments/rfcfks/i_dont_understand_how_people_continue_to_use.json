Their responses to this was literally just a &amp;quot;whoops, well looks like you caught us&amp;quot;. This is an absolute joke in my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have literally sold all my SOL, I&amp;#39;ve bought a bag of MATIC and I&amp;#39;m never going back. It&amp;#39;s more decentralized (SOL has proven to be extremely centralized), The team can actually be trusted and it&amp;#39;s just an overall better chain IN MY OPINION. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I know Solana has a higher market cap but I feel like in the long term, Polygon will be flipping it. Are you really so obsessed with making a quick buck that you&amp;#39;d invest in a project who&amp;#39;s developers have blatantly lied to your face and have disrespected you on multiple occasions? I don&amp;#39;t know about you but I&amp;#39;m not about that life. Respect yourselves, They only get away with this crap if we let them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
