For a comparison, there is $150 per person alive (M1 money supply / 8 billion humans). If Ether becomes one of the backbones of the worldwide internet economy - and who on this subreddit doubts it will at this point? - then it will reach 1000x its current market cap, over the next decade.</p>\n\n<p>I see people here buying all sorts of shitcoins - almost all living in Ethereum - but not Ethereum itself. That is like buying stocks of that old Candle App or Beer App on iOS, but not buying Apple stocks. How is that not utterly stupid?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
