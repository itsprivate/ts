Should I keep a small amount of ADA instead? I truly believe that this is the last time ATOM will be this low and with this potential bull run, cosmos will be in the low 100s very soon.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not wrinkled, I do my own research in these subs and I put a lot of trust in y’all’s DD. Did I do right or am I victim to FOMO?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all for taking the time to enlighten me and give me some insight. To clarify things, I bought 8 months ago and held the entire time. I don’t day trade and not looking for a quick buck. But after thinking about it, 8 months is not a proper time table and was selfish of me to say it’s not moving enough. I will DCA back into ADA next paycheck and start building it back up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
