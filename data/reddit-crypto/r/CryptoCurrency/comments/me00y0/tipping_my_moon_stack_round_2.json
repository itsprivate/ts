Unfortunately I only have 10% of the moons I had previously so I’m gonna have to stretch this one a bit more. Next moon distribution I plan on doing the same thing! Also, I won’t get around to tipping you until later tonight since I’m out running errands and enjoying the warm NYC weather. \n\nMy ask is the same as before. Use the moons to tip quality submissions on this subreddit. If a post educates you, informs you, or makes you laugh, throw the OP a few moons!!\n\nLove,\nx0g\n  \n  \nEdit: fuckit 5 moons to the first 60 posts. Spread the wealth like a communist baby\n\nEdit 2: make sure you set up ya vaults before I start tipping I’ll just skip you this time\n\nEdit 3: I’ve gotten a few messages telling me I’m a moon farmer. Y’all. I gave out 3.5k moons last time and only got 300 upvotes and even less than that from the moon distribution since it’s not even 1 moon per upvote now. Daddy chill.\n\n  Edit 4: I just sent out half of my moons. I stopped on /u/nz1390 . I'll get back to it later tonight and get you all your fake internet gold love u\n\n  Edit 5: I’m sorry yall im too tired but I’ll get to it tomorrow. I promise you you’ll have your moons :)\n\n  Also I spoke with the Reddit mods and unfortunately this is the last moon tipping round I’ll be able to do. Apparently the new rules state that giveaways have to be $100 each, and  have to only go to 1-3 people. I have more giveaways in mind, but If anyone has creative suggestions for me that would be great!!\n\nThanks again",
