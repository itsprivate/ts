Between 2005 and 2009 Barclays, one of the world&#39;s largest and most important banks, manipulated LIBOR to gain profits and/or limit losses from derivative trades. In addition, between 2007 and 2009 the firm had made dishonestly low LIBOR submission rates to dampen market speculation and negative media comments about the firm&#39;s viability during the financial crisis.  In settling with U.K. and U.S. regulators the firm agreed to pay $450 million in fines. Within a few days of the settlement, Barclays&#39; CEO, Robert Diamond, had resigned under pressure from British regulators. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43888\">https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43888</a></p>\n\n<p>Now the same bank wants to preach where one can and cannot spend their own funds. </p>\n\n<p>Authoritarian banks which undertake illegal manipulative schemes behind the curtains but without any shame pretend they are the gatekeeper of everyone&#39;s finances like this are the very reason crypto came into being and has grown over the past decade.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
