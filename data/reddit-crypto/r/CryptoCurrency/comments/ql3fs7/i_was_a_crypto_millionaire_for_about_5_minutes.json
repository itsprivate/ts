Of course I knew that I wouldn&#39;t ever take the money out, I was fully convinced of that, but it was fun to see it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Couple of days later, I go to check the SQUID price and it&#39;s at 2000$. I was like wtf? 2000$ times 661 SQUID is 1.3 million dollars. I was a crypto millionaire.</p>\n\n<p>5 minutes later it crashed down to nothing, but the 10$ wasn&#39;t for nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m now able to say I was a crypto millionaire at some point of my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>REMINDER: Don&#39;t ever put money on scam coins, always do your research and be careful on what you invest. I was fully aware of this scam.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT: If you&#39;re wondering how I found that this was a scam read</em></strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ql3fs7/comment/hj0gcql/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><strong><em>HERE</em></strong></a><strong><em>.
