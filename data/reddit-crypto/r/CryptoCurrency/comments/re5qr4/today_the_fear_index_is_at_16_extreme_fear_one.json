I&amp;#39;m 100% sure in a month or so we will be back at extreme greed an everyone will forget this days where they calling a 20% drop a crypto winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also 16 is pretty much the bottom last time in September it also bottomed at about the same range, that&amp;#39;s about as low as it can go no matter what so a jump back up is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one here should get scared or so just remember what goes down must also go up....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
