Never expecting much to come from it but I have always been a bit of a computer nerd and it really interested me.\n\nAlot of uninteresting stuff happened but to spare you the boredom I will fast forward to 2017, at this point in my life I am 25, had a decent paying job and a kid on the way, I didn't have alot of extra money but I worked 70 hour work weeks to make sure we didn't have to be paycheck to paycheck and me and my wife were trying to save up for a house. Ethereum really started to take off and the 400$ I put into it started to become quite a bit of money. I made some really lucky trades into cardano and nano right before they took off and somehow in the matter of 6 months my 400$ turned into half a million $. I was over the moon, me and my wife just bought our house and I had half a million to my name. No one in my family has ever had money, I have never even taken any sort of vacation and I am 25 years old and now I have my own house and half a million dollars. Holy s**t.\n\nAt the end of 2017 I considered cashing out my crypto investment to buy another house but I was absolutely convinced that it was only a matter of time before I had 7 figures, I very seriously considered quitting my job and taking a year off because my son was now 6 months old and I had barely even seen him with my 70 hour work weeks.(at my job you can work as much as you want, the more you work the more you make the 70 hours is not a requirement I just wanted to give my family a better life then I had)\n\nThen the fall started to happen, at first I told myself it will all come back and I will cash out like I planned in the first place. I lost half of what I had in only a few months and I was devastated. I started to panic and made some horrible trades, and by the end of 6 months I had only 5000$.\n\nAt that point I just put whatever currency I had in a wallet and left it. I was extremely depressed, nearly suicidal but I kept going to work every day to work hard.\n\nAbout a year later I was mostly mentally recovered, all my 70 hour work weeks came to fruition and I got a promotion, still long hours but it came with a raise. \n\nI fully committed to my role and a year and a half into my new role I was really succeeding and the company I work for was noticing, i got another promotion and this one came with a huge pay raise. They over doubled my income and I am extremely appreciative of the opportunity. I am now a year and a half into my new job and I am quite certain that in a few more years I will have the opportunity to be a partial owner in the company I work for.\n\nThe whole point of this post is that, if I had made anymore gains on my cryptocurrency I would have quit my job and never had the opportunity to make the kind of income I have now. There is always a silver lining and I feel lucky that I got the opportunity to lose all that money. The best part about it is now I work a 40 hour work week and spend a tonne of time with my son and wife!\n\nI don't have even close to what I was holding in crypto before but I am here holding with all of you! Please if you do end up losing a big chunk of money, try to look at it as an opportunity, even though I know that is very difficult while you are going through it.\n\nIf you are feeling down and out make sure you talk to someone, I am not sure how reddit really works but I'm available if you just need to send someone a message that understands what being depressed feels like.\n\nSorry for all the rambling I just wanted to share my experience",
