Here are some of the staking rewards on Binance of some popular tokens seen here on this subreddit:</p>\n\n<p>SOL - 5,21% APY / 0,43% monthly</p>\n\n<p>SAND - 12,36% APY / 1,03% monthly</p>\n\n<p>DOT - 11,51% APY / 0,96% monthly</p>\n\n<p>VET - 3,47% APY / 0,29% monthly</p>\n\n<p>MATIC - 11,34% APY / 0,914% monthly</p>\n\n<p>ALGO - 7,91% APY / 0,66% monthly</p>\n\n<p>AVAX - 7,91% APY  / 0,66% monthly</p>\n\n<p>Am I doing something wrong? Because I&#39;m not the brightest in the room. But Liquidity Pools don&#39;t seem to be a better option either? <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/half-of-uniswap-liquidity-providers-are-losing-money\">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/half-of-uniswap-liquidity-providers-are-losing-money</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, keeping my money locked up for 1% return (max, usually its half) doesn&#39;t make much sense to me? Maybe its good because people since it takes like a day to get access to your tokens when you cancel the contract, it makes much harder for hackers to steal your tokens lol. What are your opinions?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
