USD, AUD) into my local currency</li>\n<li>Finally they charge me to transfer funds to my bank account </li>\n<li>There&#39;s no interest or staking on any funds I leave and don&#39;t transfer to a local account</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This happens to each client and for each payment.  All these fees and extra charges each month easily add up to $150-$300. </p>\n\n<p>For context, this is how much $300 is worth in my country:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can get <strong>6 weeks&#39; worth of groceries</strong> for my 5-person household</li>\n<li>It&#39;s almost <strong>50% higher</strong> than our minimum wage </li>\n<li>It&#39;s equal to <strong>more than half</strong> what a young professional earns each month in their 1st job</li>\n<li>I can eat 98 Big Macs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, I get paid in crypto (not all, but a big chunk). It&#39;s mostly XRP because it&#39;s easy to withdraw here and the fees are next to nothing. </p>\n\n<p>I basically get a bonus paycheck every month and I love it. </p>\n\n<p>I now have less stress because of strict budgets for groceries, can buy actual good quality stuff, and have a bit extra to get a few small gifts every now and then for the people I care about.</p>\n\n<p>But it also makes me sad because <strong>there are literal millions of people like me</strong> who rely on payments or remittances from abroad to survive. </p>\n\n<p>$300 might be small time for folks in the US, but it&#39;s life changing for us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
