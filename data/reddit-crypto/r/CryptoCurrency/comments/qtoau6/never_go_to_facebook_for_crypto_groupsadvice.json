So I’ve had Facebook for over ten years but I’ve only been on Reddit for a little less than one year. I use Facebook for the social stuff like life updates and connecting with friends, and I got into Reddit purely for the crypto advice and news. But last week I crossed the beams and joined a couple crypto groups on Facebook and BOY DID I FUCK UP. </p>\n\n<p>I know that to OGs here complain about the recent decline in helpful advice and crypto technical talk but even in its current state, this subreddit is miles ahead of what passes for “reasonable discourse” on the other site. There’s literally no news from developers or foundations, no understanding of market cap or market trends, and barely any understanding of the blockchain they’re supporting in general. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short, Facebook is trash. Not just for Russian fake news shared by boomers, but also for the quality of crypto information. Learn from my struggles and avoid it at all cost lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
