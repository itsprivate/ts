However, it doesn&amp;#39;t look like that&amp;#39;s going to happen with the state of the market at the moment. It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC&amp;#39;s market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) The &amp;quot;so called&amp;quot; experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they&amp;#39;re talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Technical analysis in crypto can only tell you so much. Essentially, everybody (including the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot;) knows shit about fuck, and you&amp;#39;re much better doing your own research than investing based on what these bozos say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; DYOR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
