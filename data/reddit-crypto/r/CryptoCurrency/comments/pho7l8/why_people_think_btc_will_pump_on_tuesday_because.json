It&#39;s not like the government will start sending millions of individual BTC purchase orders to exchanges. There will be no pump at all or maybe a tiny one because of the hype from the Crypto community, but not because of crypto buyers from El Salvador. I bet that majority of people in El Salvador don&#39;t even care about Tuesday. Don&#39;t FOMO into BTC. Stick to your strategy, continue to DCA and watch the show.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Ah yes, bring out the downvote guns because you don&#39;t like to hear the truth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
