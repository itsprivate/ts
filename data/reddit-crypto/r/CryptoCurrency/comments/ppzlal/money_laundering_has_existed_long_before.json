They don&#39;t need cryptocurrency for this, as it has been the case in the last 2,000 years. They could do just fine with the traditional methods. Politicians should not spread fear-mongering news with cryptocurrency, and focus on the AML regulation with their banks, where the vast majority of money laundering activities happen.</p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/what-is-money-laundering-14897715\">The Street</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/kyc-io-scalable-kyc-management-solutions/the-5-largest-money-laundering-scandals-of-all-time-so-far-d30ff4abee10\">Medium</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
