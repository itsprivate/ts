I return home tonight and find out about BTC almost breaking 40k...</p>\n\n<p>I absolutely burst into laughter, I&#39;m not even mad. This is so ridiculous it was obviously going to happen to me and there we go...</p>\n\n<p>On the bright side I must say DCAing and this sub have taught me a lot! I think I will keep learning and hopefully get back into this when I feel more confident on what I&#39;m doing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
