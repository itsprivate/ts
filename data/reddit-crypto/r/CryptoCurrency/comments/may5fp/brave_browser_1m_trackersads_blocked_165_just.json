Additionally, I was essentially PAID to browse as I normally would -- with the recent run up in the price of BAT this amounts to \\~$165. Obviously not a significant amount of money, but I think the concept is awesome regardless.\n\nThe browser itself works well, and the only issues I have with it are:\n\n* You can only \"cash out\" via an Uphold wallet, which is KYC and has high fees.\n* Some issues with receiving BAT payments on time.\n* Can't enable BAT rewards on my iPhone, due to Apple's policy.\n\nTo those of you on the fence, I would suggest at least trying Brave. You can enable / disable BAT rewards (to earn BAT there are some pop-up ads that appear) as you please, so there's really no downside to giving it a shot. I think there are decent arguments on both sides about the value of the BAT token, so you can determine for yourself if enabling BAT ads are \"worth it\" for you.\n\n[Brave\\/BAT Summary](https://preview.redd.it/p9owsa5d9no61.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6164b213a07c39ccd5915c247cd2972a26ea4e2)",
