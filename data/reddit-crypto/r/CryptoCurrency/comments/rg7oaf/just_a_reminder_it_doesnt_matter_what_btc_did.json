Looking at past performance down to the day/week/month and using that to make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; prediction on pricing is a fool&amp;#39;s game. This same lunacy has been repeated in stock trading for decades and is still just as worthless as ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;all basically on some healing stones / astrology ish when you buy/sell or predict pricing based on how something performed in a specific 3 week span 49 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines: going from a $333B market cap to a $1T market cap is not the same as going from a $1T market cap to a $3T market cap. It becomes increasingly more difficult to increase market cap as your market cap increases. There is no guarantee that something that doubled from a $10M market cap to a $20M market cap in a week can double again in another week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. Fuck Tether, just because.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
