I thought it would be hard to top Tesla’s energy FUD when they are using child labor to mine lithium and ignoring so many aspects about the BTC energy debate, but here we are. So let’s recap this latest FUD. Some Russian hackers hacked Colonial Pipeline using ransomware and demanded 4.4 million in BTC. After Colonial paid them the hackers used a simple tumbler to tumble Bitcoin onto an exchange and the FBI was able to track the coins and seize the BTC. Essentially, the hackers were dumb enough to move the BTC onto an exchange that the FBI had access to and people think the FBI cracked the Bitcoin code or something. If you’re selling because of this you don’t deserve to be rich you deserve to be poor and to the hackers you really are idiots as well.",
