I got into crypto about February so im still pretty new and trying to learn as much as I can, but im definitely more of an investor than a user of blockchain. My biggest % of my portfolio is ETH, so I obviously believe in its value and tremendous upside moving forward. What’s keeping me from getting deeper into the space is the god damn gas fees. Jesus. I just wanted to sign up for an ENS domain, and the name I wanted was still available. $10 for a year? Awesome! Over $100 in gas fees? Never mind. Any time I want to interact with the ethereum blockchain beyond buying ETH on Coinbase and staking it, the gas fees make me give up. </p>\n\n<p>I want to get more involved in this space because it offers a lot of cool things that I’d like to be in on the ground floor of, but I feel like I have to wait till PoS comes along (at which point it’ll be too late.) </p>\n\n<p>TLDR I’d like to speak to the manager</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
