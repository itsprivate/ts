They’re worth practically half of what they were 15 years ago.”  \n\n#Damn\n\n“You just want to use it to buy more crypto!”\n\nAnd there it is.  She’s half right, of course.  Part of me wants to invest in anything besides holding US debt in a jar and watching it slowly erode.  \n\nLook, I’m not saying turn your real coins into virtual ones, but, had I gotten rid of said barrel last bear market and dumped it into BTC or ETH, those devaluing coins would be worth a hell of a lot more now.  Hell I could have done so six months ago and still made a killing!\n\nListen crypto fam, I’m a widower.  My late wife helped me fill that jar for years, and we never got to use it as our secret vacation jar, even though it was our plan too.  The government and inflation is going to destroy what you save.  Either invest it in crypto (or something safer if you have little risk appetite,) or go on the goddamn vacation.
