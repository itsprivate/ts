Same with parcel lots in the metaverse. That&amp;#39;s short term hype. Meanwhile there are very interesting projects out there putting out actual use cases of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know how you turn heads towards NFTs as a legit solution and not just a grand scheme for money laundering? Tell them you are going to kill Ticketmaster. Tell them that in the future, it is possible that legal documents like driving licenses could be verified worldwide against a decentralized blockchain. All this use cases are being developed right now, but they are not flashy, they are not going to make you money tomorrow and they don&amp;#39;t sell views on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all you can see behind NFT technology is overpriced JPEGs you need to step back and delve a little further down, otherwise you are going to miss on a huge future opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
