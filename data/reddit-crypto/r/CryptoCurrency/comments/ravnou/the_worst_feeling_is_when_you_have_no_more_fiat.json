Unfortunately, the worst feeling is when you can&amp;#39;t buy these dips due to not having enough FIAT. You watch coins selling for a bargain and you cant get in on the action. Yeah, you will recover the losses you made from the crash eventually, but dips are very rare, and getting in one of those is probably going to give you insane returns in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recent crash had left many Cryptocurrencies in a massive discount. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum were at their lowest since late September. Buying in that crash was literally the equivalent of DCAing for the past year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Make sure you don&amp;#39;t get into the situation some of us went into. Always have some extra amount of money sitting in stablecoins with high interest rates. It is going to be extremely beneficial for you when you have money ready to buy Crypto at bargain rates in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
