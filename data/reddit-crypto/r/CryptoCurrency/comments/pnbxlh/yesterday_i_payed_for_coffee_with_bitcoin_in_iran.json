I am not a fan of paying for daily needs with crypto just yet and i thought El Salvador accepting BTC as a legal tender was too early but i really needed to try this so i paid for everyone with BTC and it was nice.</p>\n\n<p>With the current inflation in Iran which is INSANE and is estimated to be around 50 to 150% most people are converting their savings to US dollars and now crypto. 1 USD equalls to 280000 Iranian Rials today. I hope crypto saves most of us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
