I&#39;m walking you through the best way to be certain that your flips will deliver. Sniping and flipping without some supporting software really is tough nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I&#39;ve started to learn about NFTs and got into OpenSea, I discovered that there&#39;s a sweet spot for getting good snipes. That sweet spot is when the projects just uploaded the meta data. When this happens, everyone discovers what traits their NFT has. This is an exciting moment, but it is also filled with opportunities. For example, someone who just got a super rare might have it listed for sale. It is at this time that you can buy that token if you move fast enough. </p>\n\n<p>OpenSea takes 30min-1h to update all the data, so in that time, a lot of people do not know what properties they got, even if they are publicly available. Keyword: <strong>publicly available.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been working hard to create a tool that sees all these properties before OpenSea updates them, so we can have an advantage when the reveal happens. Tell me what you think! Thanks :D</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI0iNlzQrO8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI0iNlzQrO8</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
