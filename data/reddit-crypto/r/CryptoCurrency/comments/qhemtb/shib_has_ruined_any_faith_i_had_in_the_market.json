You have people jumping on the SHIB bandwagon whose portfolios are better than mine. It&#39;s a pill I can&#39;t swallow. </p>\n\n<p>I just feel like I&#39;ve wasted a lot of effort and time. I&#39;m very depressed now, I feel like I&#39;m going to be broke forever and stuck in the prison of a deadend 9 to 5. Crypro was my hope and dreams for a better life and SHIB took that from me. GME, DOGE, SHIB...I missed them all and I hate myself for it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
