There obviously weren't enough of them which is why we used to suggest going to r/cryptotechnology for the serious stuff, but still they were more frequent then. This has been largely replaced by folk telling others about how to manage their money.\n\nTbh, I'm not some highbrow chap who thinks 'this sub has gone to the doge'. I'm not criticising the content - the money has truly changed people's lives for the better, especially in countries without stable currencies.\n\nI'm mostly just fascinated by how the subreddit has shifted over time. It's a look into how the growing subscribers of the subreddit, the change in its structure and how the general moderation process has brought a shift in the content here.\n\nCheers to my fellow Redditors here. Whatever you have come here for, glad to have you around.",
