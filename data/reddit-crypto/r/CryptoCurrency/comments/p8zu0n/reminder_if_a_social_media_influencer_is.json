If a social media influencer is promoting the coin, you will get rug pulled. These people do not care about you. They aren’t trying to make you rich. They will cash in and leave you holding their bags with absolutely no remorse. Do not pay attention to any of the stories about how X influencer is promoting a new crypto project. Do your research, and if you really think it has some potential, wait a month or two after the coin is tradable to see if it actually holds its value. But 99.99% of the time it’s just a bullshit coin with no actual use cases that just leverages buzzwords with social media hype. Be safe out there</p>\n\n<p>Edit: after reading the comments, it appears social media influencers have also promoted BTC and ETH. <strong>NO ONE IS SAFE</strong> /s</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
