Today, we&#39;ll answer the question from a post earlier asking if staking was really worth it. </p>\n\n<p>OP came to the conclusion that a 1% interest return per month wasn&#39;t looking like it was worth the hassle of locking your alts into staking rewards. </p>\n\n<p>If you plan to hodl you coins for the coming years, you HAVE to stake them to make the most of them. </p>\n\n<p>Lets do a little maths if you hodl your coins for 5 years (what&#39;s 5 years, really?) </p>\n\n<p>1% interest/months = 1.126% at the end of the years (after 12 months) </p>\n\n<p>=1.87% after 5 years. (Remember, that&#39;s only one month out of the 60 that constitute 5 years.) </p>\n\n<p>If you compound your interest monthly, you get 82% after 5 years. </p>\n\n<p>You get a 100% return (2x) after ≈ 5 years and 10 months. </p>\n\n<p>And you don&#39;t even take the price action into consideration here. If that coin does a mere 10x in the next 5 years and 10 months, just by staking it, you&#39;d do 20x on it. THAT IS HUUUGE. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s how 1000$ investments turns into 20 000$. </p>\n\n<p>*Staking rates may be reduced with the years and only a few selected great project will continue to perform in the next 5 years, but with the right strategy, it easily feasible.</p>\n\n<p>*Edit: changed commas for points, as others pointed me how to english</p>\n\n<p>So do you stake your coins? If not, did we convinced you?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
