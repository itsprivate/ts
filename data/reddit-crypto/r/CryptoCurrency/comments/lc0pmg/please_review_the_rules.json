Be civil - don't call other users names, don't use offensive language (certain words that are sprinkled generously around subs like /r/wsb or /r/4chan are not welcome here), etc.\n2. Don't post referral links or codes, don't request people to PM you for codes, etc.\n3. Don't link threads elsewhere to drive people here (no VM or brigading)\n4. Keep discussion on-topic - don't go into unrelated threads to shill \n5. No meta discussion - use modmail or /r/cryptocurrencymeta\n\nFinally, we added a new rule relatively recently:\n\n>Moderators may ask users to provide proof for any personal  cryptocurrency related stories that reach the front page. Refusing to  provide reasonable proof may lead to post removal and/or a possible ban.   \n\nWe haven't asked anyone for proof-of-gainz the last few days, but if you're going to post a sob story or a success story, please be prepared for the eventuality that we may actually ask you for proof and ban you if you don't deliver.\n\nHave fun and be nice :)",
