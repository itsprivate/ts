Now we are tracking in the same direction and this could be the start of a new bull cycle that takes us back to ATH and maybe even to $100,000 Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>If you missed out buying in July 2021 at the very start of this bull run, the second best time to buy is now. Last time BTC ran for 7 weeks in a row and it was only the start of a huge 600%+ rally. So even buying now may only be the start of the bull cycle. Stack those sats while you can!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
