Multiple use cases. Risky (according to traditional standards), but we&#39;re younger and can absorb some of that. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are others that I haven&#39;t covered, but the way I see it, crypto is the only thing accessible for the generation that feels like every other opportunity for wealth-growth is out of reach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> I&#39;m in crypto because I don&#39;t want to wait 30 years for the next <strong><em>big thing</em></strong> to come around. I&#39;ll nearly be 60 by then. Screw those people that want to stand in our way and make it difficult for us to get a piece of the pie.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A lot of comments accuse me of saying &quot;stocks are bad.&quot; <strong><em>I never said that,</em></strong> but it is clear that the fix is in and the system is designed for hedgies to win and for you to lose. Exponential growth is also severely limited. Potential for growth with stocks/indices is long and slow, especially if you don&#39;t have training/education/money to start with.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
