Bank was required by law to unfreeze the money, but refused to.</p>\n\n<p>Last week my bank called me around 9AM and told me that the account could be unfrozen. They then started apologizing for the inconvenience, but I didn&#39;t listen to that anymore.</p>\n\n<p>I directly transferred the entire balance to my other account, cancelled the bank account myself online with immediate effect, so that I would not be considered a customer there for another day. They blocked all my money for one and a half weeks, no excuse for that.</p>\n\n<p>I am amazed how my trust in banks has gone to zero in a matter of not even two weeks. Especially when it comes to just having larger amounts of money lying there.</p>\n\n<p>I will now probably leave the bulk of my uninvested assets in the Crypto/DeFi space and collect interest. At least there&#39;s still something to earn there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
