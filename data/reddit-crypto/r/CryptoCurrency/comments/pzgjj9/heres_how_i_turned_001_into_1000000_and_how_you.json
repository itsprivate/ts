Today I finally became a millionaire. Here&#39;s how I did it.</p>\n\n<p>First, I got 0.1 ONE (around $0.01) from CryptoRoyale and sent it to my Metamask wallet.</p>\n\n<p>I then went to TokenJenny and created my own coin. I chose a total supply of 1,000,001</p>\n\n<p>I paid a fee of 0.0038 ONE to mint it. And now it was in my wallet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7zbujfyqbwq71.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f3821d56f784d91f2c6302872d424def50490e2\">https://preview.redd.it/7zbujfyqbwq71.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f3821d56f784d91f2c6302872d424def50490e2</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see I now have 1,000,001 RICH tokens. But at moment they are worth nothing. But not for long.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I went to Viperswap and swapped 0.0062 ONE for 0.001 USDC</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4fhtoslxcwq71.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db2abb2365e56918010f49cc7dda25f15ba532e\">https://preview.redd.it/4fhtoslxcwq71.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db2abb2365e56918010f49cc7dda25f15ba532e</a></p>\n\n<p>I then created a trading pair for my coin on Viperswap.</p>\n\n<p>I added 0.001 USDC and 0.001 of my coin to the liquidity pool and approved it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/39qga5i9fwq71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c93cd1853c74fa2871932e6d19decff6b5204e\">https://preview.redd.it/39qga5i9fwq71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c93cd1853c74fa2871932e6d19decff6b5204e</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can all clearly see, 1 RICH = 1 USDC now. Which means I&#39;m now officially a millionaire since I still own 1,000,000.999 RICH tokens.</p>\n\n<p>See yall at the lambo dealership.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/517cdszyfwq71.gif\">https://i.redd.it/517cdszyfwq71.gif</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
