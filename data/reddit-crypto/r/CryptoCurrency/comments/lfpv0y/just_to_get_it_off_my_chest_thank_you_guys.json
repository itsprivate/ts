I'm really excited to be part of a community, and get in on crypto while it's still early. Blockchain is amazing, I just got the book \"Blockchain Revolution\" to learn more.

I've gleaned so much from lurking in the comments. Such a helpful community here. \n\nI'm still wrapping my head around the Ethereum network and altcoins. Is it weird that I just wanna collect them all like they're Pokemon??? A lot of them are cheap enough to just throw a little money at even if I don't understand their use. They all have cute little logos - hell, one of them is a UNICORN!\n\nAnyway, it's brought me out of a rough, months-long depression, and I'm pretty excited for the future again :)",
