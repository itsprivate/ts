But like the title says, don&#39;t look at it like Bitcoin is stealing the thunder of your alts, Bitcoin growth is the slow and steady pullback if a slingshot, and at some point it will let alts absolutely fly. The longer we see Bitcoin growth now, the bigger the snapback once papa Bitcoin decides to chill and find it&#39;s footing. </p>\n\n<p>My biggest mistake as a rookie investor was chasing pumps only to see my old position jump substantially after I sold to buy the top of something else. Avoid my mistakes and just hold what you believe in. There is a reason this type of info gets regurgitated here often, and it&#39;s because fomo can get intense and we all get by with community support around here. Much love to you all. Keep your heads screwed on tight.</p>\n\n<p>Your friendly neighborhood brinothedino.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
