Earnings subject to change. \n* Mobile version available but could be more user friendly\n* Only on BSC\n\n**Case Study:**\n\nPurchased 12 Characters and a decent sword for $150 (you can start with as little as $5 if you want though) Made $1.81 per character for $21.72 per day or 7-day ROI\n\n# Metal War - 30 Days\n\nPros:\n\n* PvP and PvE modes with boss and 3D units coming soon\n* Great discord and great 'customer service' -> I encountered few bumps on the road and there always was someone to help me.\n* Even with a single unit, you can mine shards of expensive units that you can further sell for crypto. So, it's up to you which strategy you want to develop : make an army, make some $$$.\n\nCons:\n\n* Very expensive entry fee to achieve best ROI (\\~$500 currently)\n* Still pre-alpha and subject to change\n* Repetitive:  you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat. \n* Repetitive: you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat (see previous point)\n\n**Case Study:** \n\nPurchased on sale for $500, making $16/day playing the game. Could play more technically but that is all the time I am willing to spend on 1 game especially with lower ROI.\n\n# R-Planet - 60 Days\n\nPros:\n\n* WAX blockchain space\n* No gas, just staking CPU\n* Passive income. Buy a rig, make money over time\n\nCons:\n\n* Price of Aether needs to be stable to earn\n* If Whales sell their rigs, it will tank the resale value of the drills, making ROI harder to achieve \n* Dated and not updated nearly enough\n\n**Case Study:** \n\nPlayed since the beginning, rigs are far less profitable now than they were when I bought them. If I purchased an equivalent rig for the current price (\\~$1200) I would make \\~$20 per day. This is completely passive as well. In my personal opinion, I would not do it at this time until they perform some updates.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, any of these will continue to grow and I am playing all of them. Not included in CryptoBlades or R-Planet are that you can sell back the NFTs you create on the marketplace for additional Return on Investment. Also with CryptoBlades, the Character NFTs level up as you use them and many of them are going for $100 when they were purchased for $5 just 2 weeks ago.\n\nAs always, Do Your Own Research. This is not financial advice. I am sharing my experience because I am passionate about Play-To-Earn and blockchain in general. If any of the above needs adjusting based on your experience, I will edit this post to include more accurate information. Thank you and have fun!",
