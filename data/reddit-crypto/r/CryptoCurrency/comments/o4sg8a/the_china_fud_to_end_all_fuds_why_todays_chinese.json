Well guess what, it&#39;s no longer valid - they might have hoarded millions of BTC, but they will no longer have 51% of the network power, and that&#39;s a game changer. </p>\n\n<p>Now with their Central Bank forbidding banks and payment providers to deal with crypto-related businesses, the FUD narrative seems to be virtually exhausted. They won&#39;t go on banning the actual ownership of crypto, since it&#39;s unfeasible (and their own courts define Bitcoin as an asset class that can&#39;t be confiscated on no substantial grounds).</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s way better to take this short-term beating, but to decouple from that authoritarian manipulative country for good.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
