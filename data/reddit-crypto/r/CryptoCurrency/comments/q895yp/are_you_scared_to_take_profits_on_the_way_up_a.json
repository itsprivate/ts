So I thought, &quot;what could I buy with my profits that actually serves more of a purpose than, say, a new phone, or a Gromit mug?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So I adopted a cat!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6uvjp5j0iht71.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2684fc8653af1649f19012c21a6612bbbd1357bd\">This is James. She loves belly rubs, playing with string, and scratching my f**cking couch</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>With my profits, I&#39;ve been able to give a 6 year old cat a good home away from the adoption center. It&#39;s a win/win for me, as I have taken some profit from my crypto stack for a really good cause, and I have a very cute cat too!</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of good places to donate, if you can&#39;t afford the space for an adopted pet but want to help. My personal favourites are the <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.au/start-your-donation-story\">RSPCA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org.au/shop?id=R2021W99g\">World Animal Protection</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
