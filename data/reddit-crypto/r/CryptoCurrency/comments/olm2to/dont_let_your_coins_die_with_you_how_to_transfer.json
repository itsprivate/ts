Once enabled, Google will automatically send a custom email to the family/friends of your choosing after a certain period has elapsed since you were last active on your Google account. Not to worry - Google will attempt to contact you a month before this actually happens, in order to prevent mistakes.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>1) Go to Google&#39;s <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/inactive\">Inactive Account Manager</a></p>\n\n<p>2) Set a waiting period of something ridiculous, like 6 or 12 or even 18 months (good for forcing the HODL from the grave!) since you were last active.</p>\n\n<p>3) Craft a nerdy email to your loved ones with important info on how to access your stash. <strong>DON&#39;T put your actual private keys or website passwords here</strong>, as this will be stored on a Google server somewhere. Just put instructions on how to access your PHYSICAL belongings like your laptop, phone, hardware wallet, safety deposit box, etc. Then direct them to a password-protected file stored LOCALLY on your computer / USB drive containing the rest of the instructions on how to access your crypto. For password protection, you can use something free and open-source like 7-Zip to turn any file into an encrypted archive.</p>\n\n<p>4) Remember to tell your family you love them and apologize cheekily for accumulating DOGE at $0.31 despite them telling you to get a job. Maybe even give them some degen trading tips.</p>\n\n<p>Sit back, relax, and enjoy providing generational wealth for your family from the grave!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
