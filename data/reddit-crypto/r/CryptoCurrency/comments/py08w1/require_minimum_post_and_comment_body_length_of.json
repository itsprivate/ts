They also have a strong link to abusive moon farming, and a huge imbalance in moon payouts to a small number of accounts hitting the cap by posting these comments. Luckily, the solution is simple. Don&#39;t disallow short posts (outside of already existing rules regarding spammy comments), but eliminate the incentive to abuse and spam them for easy moons.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proposed solutions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Text posts and comments must have a body length of at least 50 characters to qualify to earn moons. This would not apply to posts or comments that only consist of images with no text content. The mods can remove any post that they feel is padded (has content added with the main or sole goal of reaching the character limit) pursuant to this and existing rules that cover rule manipulation and evasion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;    </p>\n\n<p><strong>Reference info</strong></p>\n\n<p>This here is an example comment with 50 characters</p>\n\n<p>Emojis are typically ~2 characters and gif code is about 15. As this proposal is written, gif comments without additional text would no longer earn moons</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/py08w1\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
