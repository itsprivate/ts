Don&amp;#39;t buy doing a hike if you don&amp;#39;t wanna deal with correction prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since September BTC had just been on the rise, hitting a new all time high. Those of you who believed that this would just keep going on are now in here talking about either &amp;quot;crypto sales&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bear market&amp;quot; depending on your angle. The prices will go up again that&amp;#39;s most likely, but this correction is perfectly healthy. Just because the market isn&amp;#39;t continuing its bull run doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s all going south. Since Saturday BTC&amp;#39;s movement has been beautifully sideways. At this point most of the sell offs have most likely stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The direction of the market is upwards, but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to get used to corrections and crashes if you wanna become a stronk HODLer!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
