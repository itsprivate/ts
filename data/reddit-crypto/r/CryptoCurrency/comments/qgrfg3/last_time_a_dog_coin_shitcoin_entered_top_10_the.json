Many Defi / dex coins are faring poorly, many are below their ATH. Obviously, a lot of interest and money has gone towards trading these dog coin scraps over other projects. As a result, alts havent really taken off. </p>\n\n<p>Last time a dog coin barged its way into the top 10, the entire market crashed 20-30% in a matter of days. The parallels are just too obvious with May. Back then, the entire market was lifted by a rising tide from December to Feb, but as soon as a dog coin entered top 10, things became frothy and sure enough, we saw -10%/-15% days and volatile corrections as many big whales started seeking the exit door.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, past is not indicative of future performance, but often rhymes. A shitcoin entering top 10 with massive volume can easily be seen by big money investors as a sign of a frothy and unhealthy market, and they may choose to play it safe by taking out their profits.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
