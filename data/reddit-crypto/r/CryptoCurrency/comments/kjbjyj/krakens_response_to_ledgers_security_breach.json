If you ordered a product from Ledger, it is possible, though unlikely, that your physical address could be targeted as well.  \n \n\n**What You Should Do to Protect Yourself** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Due to the nature of the Ledger breach you should be on the lookout for **social engineering and phishing attacks targeting you specifically**. \n   * These attacks will likely come in the form of an email, text message or phone call pretending to be an exchange (e.g. Kraken) or another service (e.g. Ledger).\n   * The attackers will likely try to get you to click on a link, respond to a request or install malicious       software. \n* **Please use extra caution and read all communication multiple times.** Be sure to check the sender and triple-check links before visiting and/or entering any information including **usernames and passwords.** \n* Ensure you have **Sign-in 2FA**, ideally a YubiKey, on your Kraken account and any other online accounts that may be of interest to these attackers including your personal email account and other financial-related accounts. \n* Contact your mobile phone carrier and put a lock on your SIM so it can’t be ported to another phone (e.g. SIM swap attack).\n* Update the email associated with your Kraken account. To do this, sign in to your account, navigate to Settings > Account, enter your new email, and confirm the change with the codes that will be sent to both your old and new email addresses. Visit our Support Center for more information about email changes.\n* For more information on securing your account and digital life, visit our Support Center.\n\n As always, we are committed to your security and want to make efforts to help our clients proactively protect themselves from potential malicious attacks.  \n \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at support@kraken.com.  \n \n\nThe Kraken Team",
