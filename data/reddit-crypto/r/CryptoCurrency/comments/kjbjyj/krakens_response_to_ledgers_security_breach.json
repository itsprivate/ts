If you ordered a product from Ledger, it is possible, though unlikely, that your physical address could be targeted as well.  \n \n\n**What You Should Do to Protect Yourself** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Due to the nature of the Ledger breach you should be on the lookout for **social engineering and phishing attacks targeting you specifically**. \n   * These attacks will likely come in the form of an email, text message or phone call pretending to be an exchange (e.g. Kraken) or another service (e.g. Ledger).\n   * The attackers will likely try to get you to click on a link, respond to a request or install malicious       software. \n* **Please use extra caution and read all communication multiple times.** Be sure to check the sender and triple-check links before visiting and/or entering any information including **usernames and passwords.** \n* Ensure you have **Sign-in 2FA**, ideally a YubiKey, on your Kraken account and any other online accounts that may be of interest to these attackers including your personal email account and other financial-related accounts. \n* Contact your mobile phone carrier and put a lock on your SIM so it can’t be ported to another phone (e.g. SIM swap attack).\n* Update the email associated with your Kraken account. To do this, sign in to your account, navigate to Settings > Account, enter your new email, and confirm the change with the codes that will be sent to both your old and new email addresses.
