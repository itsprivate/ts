You are setting yourself up with flawed expectations for dissapointment and in worst case turn away from crypto when a big downturn happens. Set goals for 2030, not this cycle.",

Claiming that alt season didnt happen yet is very naive and will hurt you more than you think. In worst case, discouraging new people in crypto to get pushed out of the market entirely. Thinking crypto is a &amp;quot;scam&amp;quot; and not staying involved during down markets. This is the BIGGEST mistake you can make right now. Lose interest and not keep researching opportunities for 2022/2023/2024 etc. Losses are temporarily if you belief in the market and invest in prospering projects. But lets not kid ourselves here and say that alt season has not been here yet....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
