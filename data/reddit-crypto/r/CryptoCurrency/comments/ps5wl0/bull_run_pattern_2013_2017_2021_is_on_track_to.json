But its remarkable the amount of FUD flying around  in 2017 at about the same time and then all hell let loose. I wasn&#39;t  around in the cryptospace in 2013 so no idea of the FUD at that time if  any. The term &#39;FUD&#39; might  not even have existed then!</p>\n\n<p>But  I believe history will repeat itself and bitcoin will be the star poster child for the chartists and play its role perfectly, and be on  its way to see six figures on Xmas day. Alts too getting equally loved.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
