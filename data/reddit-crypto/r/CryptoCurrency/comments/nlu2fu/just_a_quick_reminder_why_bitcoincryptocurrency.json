Easier to transport and divide.\n* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.\n* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.\n* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.\n* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.\n* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.\n* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.\n* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.\n* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.\n* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.\n* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.\n* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.\n* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.\n* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.\n* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.\n\nSo, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.\n\nWe are here to fix the financial system.",
