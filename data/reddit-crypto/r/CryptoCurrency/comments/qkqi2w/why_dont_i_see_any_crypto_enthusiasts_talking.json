There’s so much cognitive dissonance in these ideas that we forget wealth doesn’t exist in a vacuum and can be a zero sum game. In what way can we utilize blockchain that benefits humanity but doesn’t require being early to these ecosystems in order to be ahead other people? I believe crypto is the future, but I want a better way for all people, not just for me because I know about it early. Am I alone in this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
