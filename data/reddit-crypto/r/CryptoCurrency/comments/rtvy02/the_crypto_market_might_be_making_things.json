We here are all experiencing it together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember, this sub is an echochamber that makes crypto appear that adoption is almost ubiquitous. It&amp;#39;s not. Most of the planet is still not in crypto. Most think its still a scam,or scary, or for criminals, or a bubble, or a Ponzi, or just plain useless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that you are here now, even in 2022, you are still one of the earliest adopters. Whether you are up 100k, or down 40%, in a few years it simply won&amp;#39;t matter. We will all be massively up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the year 2030, the same people that think you&amp;#39;re an idiot will say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe you bought when it was less than 60k! You are so insanely lucky!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re along for the ride at the moment, and most of the planet is still queued up at the Hotdog stand paying with their FIAT. They&amp;#39;ll join us on the ride eventually, but they still think its far too risky, and not worth giving up their current lifestyle choices. Meanwhile, we&amp;#39;re having the time of our lives seeing a never ending unpredictable path of turns, drops, climbs, twists, rises and falls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we can call each other dumb for backing X coin, being a maxi, or not diversifying, or forgetting to DCA, but in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. Crypto is inevitable, and will change the world, and most people still don&amp;#39;t even realise that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are one lucky bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
