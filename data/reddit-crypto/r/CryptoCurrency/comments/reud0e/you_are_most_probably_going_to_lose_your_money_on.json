What they don&amp;#39;t tell you is that they use the same underlying photo and rebrand those 10,000 &amp;#39;art&amp;#39; pieces by adding accessories to it. Same ape- with sun glasses and without sun glasses, with armour and without armour, with this and without this, are being categorised as distinct NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To top that off, they don&amp;#39;t even build these &amp;#39;art pieces&amp;#39; themselves. Most of them use online softwares to assemble the body parts and give them a random rarity factor. And then they advertise it as the most rare &amp;#39;NFTs&amp;#39; would be a fortune in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They sell all these &amp;#39;legitimate&amp;#39; art pieces for as much as $500/$600 each. And... people are buying all of these &amp;#39;NFTs&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To all you folks, if you see a project which has done nothing but create these &amp;#39;distinct&amp;#39; NFTs and you put your money in it- you are probably going to lose money there. There won&amp;#39;t be any community left once the facade of uniqueness is exposed to the larger public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
