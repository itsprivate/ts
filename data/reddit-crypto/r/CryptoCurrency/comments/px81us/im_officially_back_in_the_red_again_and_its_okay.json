My months worth of crypto gains is lost. </p>\n\n<p>And you know what? It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine with it. </p>\n\n<p>6 months ago i would&#39;ve freaked out cuz i was balls deep in shitcoins. Got rugpulled, got honeypotted. I was dumb, but i listened to the advice of you guys here. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Im in proper projects, and I&#39;m staking anything that can be staked. I believe in the projects i hold. </p>\n\n<p>I may be down temporarily, but I know it&#39;s a cycle. We&#39;ll see green pasteurs again. I&#39;ve not put in more than I can lose either. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m gonna continue to dca and hold. Whether we dip further or my investments go to zero, I&#39;m gonna ride this all the way to the end. </p>\n\n<p>Hope this is some consolation to any of you newbies out here freaking out. </p>\n\n<p>DCA, dont invest more than you can lose, stake anything that can be staked, and enjoy the ride.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
