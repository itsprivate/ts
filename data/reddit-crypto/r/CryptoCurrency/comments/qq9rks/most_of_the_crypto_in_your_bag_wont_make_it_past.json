In my opinion, projects that focused on real world usage had the greatest upside. </p>\n\n<p>Listening to this subreddit, I was shilled some popular projects and did research on a variety of them, deciding I would invest in: FUN, REQ, WTC, and VET. Now, as most of you know, FUN, REQ, and WTC are very irrelevant if not dead projects now. I got lucky with VET, and was also lucky that I decided to consolidate my other holdings into VET because it showed the most promise.  I made it out of the other side of the bear market in good shape because of this - as HODLing these other projects would have been a nail in the coffin. </p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the lesson here? Most of the low cap coins being shilled on the daily discussion are going to go down 95%+ in the next bear market and never recover. You have to be <em>very</em> careful about which projects you choose to HODL, and make sure you&#39;ve done your due diligence to make sure you&#39;re investing in more than &quot;hype.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
