The Apple Watch already has an automatic SOS feature where it will call emergency services with a latitude and longitude if the accelerometer registers a hard fall. Take this just a little bit further: the heartrate monitor detects asystolic cardiac arrest for 30 minutes. This triggers an oracle that tells a smart contract within your crypto on the blockchain to move it to a pre-determined wallet automatically. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing some posts here about making provisions for your loved ones after death got me thinking about the volume of crypto that must be lost forever on the blockchain. Maybe a Dead Man&#39;s Switch could help ensure this occurs just a little less. </p>\n\n<p>Last thought: Could smart contracts also fulfil the movie trope scenario? If you didn&#39;t interact with a blockchain asset within certain time parameters could it &quot;move itself&quot; to another wallet? Thanks for indulging my curiosity guys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
