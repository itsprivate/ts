Its a 2 digit number in the very low end but still they gave me shit for that because Im “too poor to invest “ especially in “grey market such as crypto”. I smiled but didnt appreciate that at all. Then I was asked why am I using that little money that I have to invest in crypto instead of spending it on my children. </p>\n\n<p>I was pretty damn angry. I do everything for my kiddos, work 2 jobs and still some people give me shit cause I put a tenner in at the end of month. </p>\n\n<p>Crypto is for everyone regardless how poor they are. Dont let anyone tell you different!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
