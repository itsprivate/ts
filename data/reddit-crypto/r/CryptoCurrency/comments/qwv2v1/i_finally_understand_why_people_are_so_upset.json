Holy crap!    </p>\n\n<p>I understand that the fees are high because usage is high, and that the fees are a cost of keeping things relatively decentralized, but god damn when the market is popping off it&#39;s basically impossible for anyone besides a 5 or 6 + figure whale to make transactions if they&#39;re not on a Cex.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a real shame!! I hope they can sort it out, I&#39;d much rather have my ETH and ERC20 tokens in my own wallet instead of on an exchange, but for now it really doesn&#39;t seem feasible!!     </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, rant over. Please use the comments below as a safe space to complain about gas fees or make arguments for them. Just be nice to people !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
