At first I was delighted because this means crypto is becoming mainstream and soon enough I can go to my favorite local restaurant and be able to pay for my meal with crypto. But later on I realized crypto becoming mainstream also means a ton of shit coins rising. Crypto being regulated by the government can also be a downside (but could be an upside depending on how you see it) How about you guys what do you  think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
