Hope  you like!\n\n**\\[1976\\]**, **The Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol**:  This is the first known protocol to propose a private and a public key  in cryptography. Before that, two parties would needed to agree in  advance on which key would be used to decrypt a message. It's the  classical \"knock this *tip tip top*  pattern when you reach my door\" we see in old movies. After the  protocol, no previous agreement was needed. You can find the paper here:  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055638/](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055638/)\n\n**\\[1983\\], David Chaum's eCash**: He published many papers about how to transfer value through the web. A full list can be found here: [https://www.chaum.com/publications/](https://www.chaum.com/publications/).\n\n**\\[1980's\\], The Goldwasser-Micali-Rivest Digital Signature**:  With the DH protocol, you could share your public keys and the other  party could decrypt your message, but there was no way for this other  party to verify if the message was actually sent by you. The papers  published in the 1980's by these authors fixed that. A nice paper from  them that summarizes everything can be found [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Digital%20Signatures/A_Digital_Signature_Scheme_Secure_Against_Adaptive_Chosen-Message_Attack.pdf).\n\n**\\[1997\\], Adam Back's HashCash:**  The very first proof-of-work algorithm that was probably the biggest  inspiration for Satoshi. You can find all the related papers here: [http://hashcash.org/papers/](http://hashcash.org/papers/)\n\n**\\[1998\\]**, **Wei Dai's B-money concept**:  Traced out the very concept of what we know today as smart contracts  and exchange of value without the need of a third-party verification.  Read it here: [http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt)\n\n**\\[2001\\], Liberty Reserve:**  A centralized digital currency system based in Costa Rica. Shut down  due to tax implications and money laundering for criminal uses. More  info on their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Reserve).\n\n**\\[2005\\], Nick Szabo's Bit Gold:**  I hardly doubt that Satoshi did not read Nick's idea and proposal (and  I'm not sure if he/she/they ever mentioned it in their communications).  It's extremely similar to what Bitcoin is. Details can be found here: [https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html)\n\n\\-\n\nThere  would be a lot more to share, because science is cumulative: Maxwell's  electromagnetism needed Newton's calculus, Newton's calculus needed  Hasan Ibn al-Haytham's and others' ideas; Einstein's photoelectric  effect needed Planck's energy quantization, which needed Clausius's and  Gibb's works on thermodynamics, so forth and so on.\n\nSome  say that Bitcoin is a technological fraud, because it poses nothing  new, i.e. all of its ideas were published before, these people forget  that the theory was published in *separate papers and perspectives.*  With this argument, we can pretty much say that Maxwell's  electromagnetism is a fraud. Why don't we say that? Because it works.  The same goes for Bitcoin.\n\nGodspeed and happy 60k!\n\nContribuiton of user oGceaseless: Satoshi greatest contribution was to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem.",
