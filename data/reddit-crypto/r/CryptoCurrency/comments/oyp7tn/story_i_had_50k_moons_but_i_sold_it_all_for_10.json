The title sounds hilarious, but it&#39;s actually true.</p>\n\n<p>Back when Moons were a Rinkeby token with an xDai equivalent, when it peaked a few months back at around 15 cents, I decided to sell all of them. I turned all of them into BNB, and traded with that on PancakeSwap.</p>\n\n<p>Now, originally, I had success. Of course I decided to stray away from dog coins or safe coins and the like. But I found some decent BSC projects that I have, unsurprisingly, done DYOR on. I had $5k, and it peaked to about $10k. I had bought several obscure crypto, such as ALPACA and BUNNY. Great. I sold all of them. I was considering consolidating them all to Ethereum until I decided to get greedy. Sadly this was the case. This was just before the Elon dump.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I could somehow keep going and try $20k. So I bought 2 <em>much more obscure</em> tokens. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancaketools\">TCAKE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/growing-fi\">GROW</a>. TCAKE was a BSC charting app and GROW was a yield farm that gave BNB to holders.</p>\n\n<p>As Bitcoin dumped from 64k to 30k in months, I had all in on TCAKE. This crypto was at its peak in $0.15, and it crashed from $0.10 to $0.05. I dare say this was an amazing dip buying opportunity, and bought. But no. It went from $0.05 to $0.01. So I was left with just $2k.</p>\n\n<p>I decided, well that sucks, but hey. That&#39;s the world of shitcoins. TCAKE was pretty much dead, and I was right, the price went to $0.005 today. Better move on.</p>\n\n<p>So I went to GROW, which had an ATH of $420. GROW, here&#39;s the problem. As all yield farms are highly inflationary, they&#39;re doomed to fail very quickly. But everyone was highly enticed by its BNB rewards so I thought it&#39;d pump. So I went and bought it when it heavily dipped to $80. Well, right now it sits at $12. You guessed it, my value is now at $300.</p>\n\n<p>What if, I had kept the 50k in moons? I would have a whopping $16k.</p>\n\n<p>The world of shitcoins is much more dangerous than you think. It&#39;s fun to dabble with little cash but stay and you will get crushed hard eventually.</p>\n\n<p>Just stick with the top 100, especially coins like BTC and ETH when you know they&#39;ll never die, and any extra tokens like moons, just HODL and not trade.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
