  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday evening I made a bank transfer to my crypto_dot_com fiat wallet.  This is something that I`ve done many times in the last few months with very little problem and I even have them as a saved payee. Occasionally I`ve had to complete anti fraud checks; such as responding to my banking app or a SMS notification to confirm that it was me making the transfer.   However, last night my balance didn&#39;t update, so I assumed that I`d not hit confirm and so made a smaller test payment.  This time I received an error message &quot;RPS01&quot; that said their have been issues with the payment system and to check again in 4hrs.  </p>\n\n<p>I made a payment to another card account to see if it was their system or specifically CDC and those went through fine.  I opened up a chat with them and was told a similar message, that they couldn&#39;t confirm the status of the transfer but they&#39;re normally resolved in 4hrs.  I was also able to use the CDC visa card top-up from the same source.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I went to login to my mobile app to check the status and found that I was locked out.  The same with my online banking.  I had an error code (RG21M) that suggested that my account did not exist and a message to phone them.</p>\n\n<p>The number took me through to their anti fraud, so I thought that perhaps they&#39;d been a bit heavy handed but it would be a simple case of confirming that I`d made the payment.  Instead, after confirming my ID and explaining the circumstances surrounding the payment, I was told that they&#39;d escalate my case to another department.  There where I was told &quot;your account was locked due to the nature of your activity being related to cryptocurrency purchases or investments&quot; and that they would now read me a statement.   To reinstate my account, I would have to answer a series of questions that could take up to 30 minutes and that my responses would be digitally recorded.</p>\n\n<p>I had no choice but to agree, and thankfully it took much less time than that due to me pre-empting some of their questions.   I was told that if I continued with the payment then I was not protected by them.   At the end of the call, I asked whether my account would now be free to send further payments to this account and was told that it was likely that future payments may get flagged.</p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea of some of the questions that I was asked...</p>\n\n<p>- What research have I done into Cryptocurrencies? Am I aware of the risks around them? How long have I been purchasing Cryptocurrencies?</p>\n\n<p>- Why did I pick this particular exchange? Why did I trust them and what due diligence had I done?</p>\n\n<p>- Who had advised me to invest? Was I investing on behalf of anyone else? What was the source of my funds for the investment etc etc</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
