I hope some of you new CRO holders managed to get some solid gains as well. I knew this was a project I wanted to invest into after seeing their aggressive marketing strategy, as well as their staking benefits to keep investors inside the ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the gains, i&#39;m not selling any of my CRO as i&#39;m enjoying the sweet 10% APR and visa card benefits. It&#39;s still amazing to see a coin you&#39;ve been holding for so long finally take off. What are you planning to do with your bag?</p>\n\n<p>A little tip:</p>\n\n<p>-If you stake CRO in their Defi Wallet APP you can get 12.8% returns.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
