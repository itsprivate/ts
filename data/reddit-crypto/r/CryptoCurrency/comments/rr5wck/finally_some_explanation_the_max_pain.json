Data shows that bitcoin tends to move toward the  “max pain” point in the lead-up to an expiration and sees a solid  directional move in days after settlement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/le7j4igftg881.png?width=1440&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5969273d5b3897c85c202eff6969bb2b64efd983\"&gt;huge open interest!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This price move trend usually comes from spot market manipulations by  option sellers to push the spot price closer to the strike price at  which the highest number of open options contracts expire worthlessly.  That creates maximum losses – so-called max pain – for option buyers.  The max pain point for Friday’s option expiration is $48,000, according  to Cayman Islands-based crypto financial services firm Blofin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/28/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-slumps-to-below-48k-ahead-of-6b-options-expiry/\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
