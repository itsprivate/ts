Green is nice, I don&amp;#39;t want bear market to accumulate more coins. Dips are fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all of you who endured and pushed through this. It probably was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of you deserve my humble respect, you are the real champions. Enjoy the green color again, you made it possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I hope you got some good bags of coins you believe in on this 72hours crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you sold, it was a good chance to sell it at lower price with loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess we won&amp;#39;t be putting suicide hotline number on the sub?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
