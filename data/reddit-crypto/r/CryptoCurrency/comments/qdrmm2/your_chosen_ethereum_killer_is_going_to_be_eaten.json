And there can be hundreds or thousands of zkRs interoperating relatively seamlessly.</strong> &quot;</p>\n\n<p>A zkRollup is a technique in which transactions are batched off-chain and settled on-chain. Put more simply, it is a much more efficient usage of block space on Ethereum Layer 1.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of 1 transaction taking up 1 transaction worth of block space, Layer 2s allow for many transactions to occupy that space.</p>\n\n<p>Add on to this that there can be &quot;hundreds or thousands&quot; of rollup projects operating at the same time, and modular blockchains have solved scalability and thus have solved the <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition\">Scalability Trilemma</a></p>\n\n<p>Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, and others have seen that monolithic architecture is extremely limiting in the long-term, even if it provides short-term advantages.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s more, <em>monolithic blockchains are more likely to pivot to becoming rollups for Ethereum than they are to kill it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Once projects realize that all the users are on Ethereum, they will understand that the best decision they can make to improve their project is to pivot away from being their own monolithic chain.</p>\n\n<p>The future lies in Modular Blockchains.</p>\n\n<p>For more reading check out: <a href=\"https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d\">https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
