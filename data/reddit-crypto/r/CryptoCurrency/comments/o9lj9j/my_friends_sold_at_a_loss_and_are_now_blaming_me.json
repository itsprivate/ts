And I have hundreds of hateful messages from my OWN relatives and friends. They accused me of scamming them and one even asked me if I was the one who stole their money. Most of them sold everything last week, taking heavy losses. And today I wake up and see that one of the shit coin they bought (won&#39;t mention the name to avoid shilling) has risen almost 20%. And you know what, they are again texting me and ranting about how I didn&#39;t force them to not sell since I was an &quot;expert&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR : Never f*cking talk about crypto with ANYONE.
