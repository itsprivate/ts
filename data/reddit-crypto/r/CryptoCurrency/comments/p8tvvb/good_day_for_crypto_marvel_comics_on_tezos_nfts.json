After the first comic book was released a few weeks ago, the second volume of the Emergents comic book series has been released.</p>\n\n<p>Both the storyline and drawings in the series are world-class and created by a team of artists and writers that have built a great reputation creating comics for Marvel. They previously have created both art and stories for Marvel comic books like X-Men, Iron Man, The Hulk, Spiderman, Crimson Dynamo, Spider Woman, Darkstar, Ultraverse, and much more. </p>\n\n<p>(See for reference marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database the writers and artists that have contributed to the first two editions of the series: Steve Ellis, Will Pfeifer, John Rozum, Christy Marx, Sholly Fisch, Cliff Richards, Freddie E Williams II, Scott Kolins, Cover Artist, and Julian Lopez)</p>\n\n<p>Three comic book series\nThere will be three comic book series launched that will form the Emergents Universe comic book line: “The Nine”, ” Emergents Presents” and a stand-alone version that will follow the character “ZoeMG”.</p>\n\n<p>The comics will be free-to-read on the InterPopComics.com platform, but in the first week, after they are released, they can only be read if you buy the NFT version, which is priced under $10 USD. Buying the NFT version of the comic will allow you to read the comic right away. </p>\n\n<p>Certain decisions in the future storyline or artwork of the comics will be in the hands of the fans through a governance system.

One of the three stories each week. There will also be offerings of Limited Edition variant cover versions of the comic for sale with covers tied to the story that is being featured that week.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/XN7pze2YHcxjpSFS7\">Thumbnail </a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
