But my question is: Why? Are the benefits of using Crypto.com worth making the switch? I&amp;#39;m honestly very happy with Coinbase. I know people have had massive issues but I haven&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.. Should one switch to Crypto.com or is it just as well to stay with Coinbase? I&amp;#39;m genuinely asking, because I don&amp;#39;t know which one is best. I started with Coinbase and just stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
