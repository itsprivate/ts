Should I switch over to these other chains that are surging into the top 10? It seems risky to sell, yet I’m scared people are losing faith in ETH and the price will go down rather than up. Maybe ETH 2.0 actually is “a mess” and developers are switching to these other chains, and ETH won’t be able to recover. What do I do?</p>\n\n<p>I’ll tell you what I won’t do. I will not. I repeat. I will not sell my ETH. That’s exactly what these turd furgeson’s want, so they can scoop them up now while it’s still relatively cheap. So there. I’m not selling, and screw you for making me scared and telling me I should consider selling. Who’s with me? Diamond hands all the way</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
