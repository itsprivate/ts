Don’t rely on hardware completely it can and will fail at some point. Make sure to keep the backup completely offline. — The most common seed backup methods are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>A simple piece of paper</strong> (Don’t print, use a pencil/pen)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>A metal plate</strong> (It’s the safer method since it’s resistent to fire, water and earthquakes. Engrave the words yourself manually.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>Data Leaks</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Database breaches will always happen and it’s not even your fault. The best you can do is protect yourself against it by using the most secure tools on all ends.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>2FA</strong>, avoid using your phone number, use Authenticator apps instead. Sim swap attacks are more common than you think. — There are countless authenticator apps out there: <strong>Google Authenticator</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Authenticator</strong>, <strong>OTP Auth</strong> etc.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Mobile Provider</strong>, you can request to set up additional security steps to prevent sim swaps. You shouldn’t rely on it, social engineering can still exploit the extra steps.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Password Manager</strong>, unique and strong passwords for all accounts are essential. — The safest and recommended providers are: <strong>Bitwarden</strong>, <strong>KeePass</strong> and <strong>LessPass</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Request Data Deletion</strong>, request the deletion of your data from crypto companies. Especially from the hardware wallet companies. Leaks of personal information, addresses and phone numbers happened in the past before.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
