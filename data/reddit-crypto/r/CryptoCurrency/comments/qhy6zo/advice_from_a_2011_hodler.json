Been holding crypto since 2011. </p>\n\n<p>Its been a long and bumpy road filled with mixed emotions, endless nights and….. cockiness… this is my advice for you..dont get cocky.. dont sit down with that smirk on your face like you own the world now and u can predict the future. </p>\n\n<p>2017 bull run i was the king of my family and friends. Sitting there showing off on how much gains i made. I got everyone to invest. Then boom! Market correction/crash. I lost my balls at the time and the balls of my close friends and family. Why? Because i got cocky. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately i did not learn my lesson. Did more stupid moves and lost around 80% of my portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>Got even cockier and lost everything. </p>\n\n<p>Lesson is do your research. Do not sit for hours convincing friends which coins to invest in. You are not invincible. Dont put all your eggs in one basket. And take profits! Theres an old proverb “one bird in the hand is better than 10 in the tree”. </p>\n\n<p>This is financial and social advice. </p>\n\n<p>HODL</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
