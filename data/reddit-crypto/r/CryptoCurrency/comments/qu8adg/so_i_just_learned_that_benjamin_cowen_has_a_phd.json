He said it so casually and after months of watching this guy for shit and giggles, I never choked on my coffee. I never thought to look up his linkin page and yeah. You can google it yourself. Was a NASA undergraduate research assistant and taught NASA space camps during his undergrad. Cross-referenced this and yeah, we don&#39;t deserve this guy&#39;s free analysis. </p>\n\n<p>This guy is always so mellow, realistic, and conservative. He could have easily come onto Youtube calling himself Dr.Crypto and yelling, &quot;I studied for NASA so we&#39;re going to the moon bois!&quot; But Nah, the dude&#39;s chill with a cardboard desk and just likes math enough so he got a Ph.D. in it and offers us free T.A., and if we want we can pay for more, but no pressure. Gotta respect this guy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
