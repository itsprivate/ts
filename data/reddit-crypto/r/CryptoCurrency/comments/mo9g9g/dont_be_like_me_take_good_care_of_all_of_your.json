Simple stuff like \"UBT now available on IDEX, this has a lot of potential\".  Just the average shills nothing special. \n\nI know for fact when I bought it because I tend to shill the crypto on twitter whenever I buy it.  Totally normal degenerate thing to do right? \n\nBack then 2017/18 I would scope out super low cap coins and new releases to see if anything special is going on.   I would buy $100-$200 worth , lock it away in a wallet and forget about it.     UBT was one of them, and Hubii network was the other.  Hubii still hasn't done jack but they are connected to one of the biggest Telecommunication companies that's Telenor.    \n\nThose are the things I would look out for. I say to myself. \"That's a huge name, and they got financial and advertising backing behind it if they ever wanted to mass shill it\" \n\nWell UBT was $0.02 at the time.  Now it's $2.18.  that's 100x and I know my habits. I never invested anthing less that $100 for a long term hold except once. Lowest was $50 and I remember that one clearly. It was smart cash when it first was released. A shitcoin\n\nWhatever. \n\nPoint is, I didn't take care of that recovery phrase for UBT. I moved since then. A lot of hectic shit going on. Had 2 kids since.   I literally tore apart my house. I found just about every recovery phrase from countless wallets except for my UBT.   That $100 is now worth $10,000.   \n\nI have a bad habit of not caring about Dust in wallets of it's only a little bit, and UBT might have been straight garbage for a while.  Either way, I didn't take good care of it.   I only took care of my main stuff, I kept it all in a safe. \n\n\nSo now I'm out $10K which could easily be $20K in this bull.   \n\nMain point here..  EVEN IF ITS only $10 in an old wallet.  TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE YOU WOULD YOUR MAIN HOLDINGS. EVEN $10 IN UBT is now $1000.   Even the $3 dust that left you 0.5 BNB is now worth $225. \n\nTake good care of those small dollars because you really just never know I'm this space.\n\nAnd btw, I am quite upset about it. It hurts",
