They usually reference 2017 till now. I get it, some coins get wrecked but that was also a very different time in Crypto. I think the blow to credible Alts won&amp;#39;t be as harsh this time around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, a number of them will not recover. This is the time to air it all out, which coin(s) will not survive?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
