But I don&#39;t want to miss out on any possible game changers. So I&#39;ve chosen to delegate all of the job to my trading bot. But, of course, I still need to watch it once in a while. The trading bot I&#39;m currently using automatically generates and adjusts the balance of a digital asset portfolio for you. It’s algorithm is focused on long-term asset allocation, which is where I&#39;m fixating my efforts because, as I previously stated, I can&#39;t be all hands on deck, so I guess DCA is really the best choice for me right now.<br/>\nWhat are your thoughts? Also, if you&#39;re currently using a trading bot, what bot are you using and what are you using it for?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
