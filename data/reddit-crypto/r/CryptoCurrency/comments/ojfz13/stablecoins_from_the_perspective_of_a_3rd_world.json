Brief intro: I&#39;m a 22 year old economics student currently at university, got interested in crypto as a gamble with doge and that has helped me better understand the technology and take care of my personal finances (now I&#39;m more diversified and in better projects). English is not my first language so excuse my grammar.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m from Argentina and we have a 50%+ inflation rate, as you all know this is really bad. Worst of all, the goverment does not allow you to buy more than 200 dollars every month. So saving has become increasingly difficult given that the currency loses a third of it&#39;s value every year. </p>\n\n<p>So in this context come stable coins. Tied to the value of the dolar, easy to buy and trade. Hard to get robbed on (unlike physical dolar bills). Basically they have given me the chance, and for other latin-american people, to save and plan for a future life. This also applies to people at Venezuela, who are having a much rough time.</p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, for most people in developed countries stable coins may seem pointless as you can have as much dolars as you want in your bank account, but for many people in developing countries like myself they give us a chance to shelter from the financial risks of our economy. Like americans use BTC, crypto and stocks to shelter from inflation in the USA, we want to shelter from our crazy inflation by buying dolars.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m planning to make a post a day doing research/explaining the economics behind coins for the next 2-3 weeks as I have holidays from studies. If anyone wants me to cover a specific topic let me know!! Most voted comment from the previous day will be researched!!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I have 20+ notificacions from comments, I will take time to answer each but it is going to take time! Please be patient! Everything was answered!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: For those wondering, there are indeed ways of buying dolars at what&#39;s called &quot;a cave&quot;. Places in which someone illegally buys and sells foreign currency. They are usually not that shady but there have been police arrests so it can be risky sometimes as you risk going to jail. There are other &quot;legal&quot; ways in which you can buy a bond or stock with pesos (our currency) that is also traded in the foreign market and sell it for dollars to someone abroad, the problem is that there might be price fluctuations and you are forced by law to hold the asset for at least 5 days. (It may not seem like much but we&#39;ve had days in which bonds lost 35% of their price).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
