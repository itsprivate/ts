But for the 1 person reading this who IS (somewhat deeply) invested in crypto and is literally fiat broke, you are overleveraged.  </p>\n\n<p>We love to make our jokes and memes, but if you literally cannot put food on the table because of crypto, then you are not feeding an investment, you&#39;re feeding an addiction. Now, to make sure this message isn&#39;t misconstrued, this isn&#39;t to say &quot;poor people shouldn&#39;t invest in crypto.&quot; This is to say &quot;put food on your and your family&#39;s plates, THEN invest in crypto&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>Be smart. Because you can&#39;t eat a Bitcoin. At least I hope not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
