Right now everyone who's pumping as well is happy, but soon the downfall will be evident. Don't support pumps and dumps, support crypto in general. Pumps and dumps will only show the world that maybe crypto isn't that safe when in fact, it is safe, from an investing point of view but also to be used in our daily life.\n\nI know 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, but still, be a good boy, please.  \n\n\nedit: r/SatoshiStreetBets doing it, not r/wallstreetbets",
