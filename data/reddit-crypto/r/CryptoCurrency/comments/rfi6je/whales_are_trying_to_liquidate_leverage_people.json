Some of these may even be from the exchanges itself, or investment firms trying to predate individual investors before taxation changes and ways to regulate then are placed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dont try to fight against it, scale your leverage down, don&amp;#39;t leverage today, and if not leveraging just hold. After that we may expect a short squeeze, same motivation, big players are even taking hits in order to assure huge gains for themselves or for the exchanges. It&amp;#39;s NOT a day to be bold, it&amp;#39;s a day to relax, reduce risk and be calm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BEWARE WITH THE ORDERBOOK it lies, whales are putting huge orders to bait small fish and then removing it to sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EditLol nice to see a lot of you hate leverage, but the post means something else: This is an opportunity to buy crypto in a low price, especially if you believe we are in a bull market. ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably a good day to put in some of the money you saved to DCA, but not all of it, keep calm, keep carefull. In the long run whales can&amp;#39;t do this kind of manipulation and the market tend to become stable again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
