In long bear markets, this will not happen.</p>\n\n<p>The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that BTC was 2.5k around June-July in 2017. You wouldn&#39;t have believed it would hit 20k by December back then either. 2013 same story with a lot of sideways during middle of the year.</p>\n\n<p>First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world&#39;s most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.</p>\n\n<p>Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, BTC started in 3 figures and reached 4 figures.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, BTC started in 4 figures and reached 5 figures.</p>\n\n<p>In 2021, BTC started in 5 figures and will reach 6 figures.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like clockwork. A mathematical miracle!</p>\n\n<p>Edit : These are my thoughts based on my own research. NFA. DYOR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
