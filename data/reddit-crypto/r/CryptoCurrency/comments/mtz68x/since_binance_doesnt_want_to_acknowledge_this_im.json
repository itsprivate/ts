Here's my last shot.\n\nIn  early 2017 I created a binance account and bought some ADA/BNB and  never really checked it until Jan 2021. I can still log into the binance  account because I have my orig logon info, google 2fa set up, and a sms  number registered with the account.\n\nApparently  after 6months of inactivity the email address I registered with Binance  had expired. This was the email I used to get my withdraw pins.   Because I can't get withdraw pins, I cannot make withdraws.\n\nTo set up a new email I need to be verified. Binance will not verify me since I am a US citizen.\n\nAll  I would like to do is get my coins moved from Binance to BinanceUS so I  can withdraw them. I have tried to contact both Binance and BinanceUS  but neither are able to assist apparently.  I was told my coins were  \"safe\" but I literally can't withdraw them.\n\nI'm  not here to bash binance or to bring them negative attention but I do  need help with this and I do not feel like I was getting the required  level of support in my emails to resolve this. Is anyone here familiar  with the process or able to share their experience? Thank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit--Thank you so much to everyone who is commenting/upvoting for visibility!! I really appreciate the attention people are showing this post. I'll go through the comments and try some of the methods after work. This really is a great community.\n\nupdate- A binance mod commented on my post in /binance and I have since provided them with my username. Awaiting a response. ",
