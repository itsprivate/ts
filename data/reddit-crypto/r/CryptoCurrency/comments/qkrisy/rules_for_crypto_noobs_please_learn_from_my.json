  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ol>\n<li><p>Write down your keys. Write them down twice with instructions like you were talking to a golden retriever. \nTest them and try to restore so you know the software is legit. </p></li>\n<li><p>The exchange only seems like a good wallet til they are hacked.  Remember the term &quot;Not your keys, not your crypto&quot;\nEdit. To emphasize this please remember most transactions on your apps are not stored on the immutable blockchain (the whole point of crypto). Your basically giving organizations money for zeroes on a screen until you withdraw then it&#39;s put on the blockchain.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I personally don&#39;t have a problem with anyone keeping their funds long term on kyc established sites like coinbase as long as you have 2fa and have confirmation its on the blockchain but I&#39;d stay away from holding it at places - there&#39;s a ton- that are not reputable. They&#39;re never gonna care as much as you do.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Dollar cost average to minimize losses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Always buy the dip and hold or have an exact game plan for stop limits if you are a trader. (If your a trader you know this obviously) more for people who can&#39;t tolerate risk.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take profits but never sell the whole bag. I ditched 200 solana for 1g. Yes im an idiot. </p></li>\n<li><p>Low transaction count is easier to keep track of and always keep track! Will make tax time easier.</p></li>\n<li><p>Dont try and hide it your not doing anything wrong or illegal as of time of writing. </p></li>\n<li><p>Do hide it from friends and family, if your not married why does the SO need to know. I know it&#39;s exciting but they will expect same results and will most likely not put the effort in and get pissed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stake stake stake.</p></li>\n<li><p>Think about the next 3-6 years and how many boomers will be scammed because they gave away their seed. Calling their grandson in to fix they&#39;re banking problem to find out they&#39;ve lost all of their life savings.  We haven&#39;t even got started on the loss porn. Gonna be tragic. Don&#39;t be one of those ppl. </p></li>\n<li><p>DONT ever send crypto to anyone you don&#39;t expressly know no matter how legit. especially exchange support. First thought should be assuming your being scammed as soon as you get a message requesting crypto or clock in for work. I was scammed out of 1000 ADA. Yes im an idiot. </p></li>\n<li><p>Know your investments and research or when it dips you will not believe in the project and want to sell. </p></li>\n<li><p>There is no get rich quick scheme, time is the only thing that will grow your portfolio. </p></li>\n<li><p>Btc and Eth are without a doubt the safest long term investment...don&#39;t expect your eth shitcoin to be there long term. </p></li>\n<li><p>Eth gas fees are super high don&#39;t mess w those transactions unless you like lighting a match to hundreds of dollars. Token Metrics recommends  at least 25k in Eth to make the fees worth it. </p></li>\n<li><p>Always send a little amount first to make sure everything legit- one rule I follow is when copy pasting checking the first three and last three letters of the TX address. </p></li>\n<li><p>Secure your moons there is a vault phrase for them. </p></li>\n<li><p>Use 2fa. </p></li>\n<li><p>Whitelist your w/d addresses. Can&#39;t stress this enough.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most rug pulls start with the ICO... Squid was predictable. I would try asking yourself what is the usecase and reason people will buy this project..Maybe it could&#39;ve pumped like Shib?   Well never know. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To everyone asking if I&#39;m ok...yes im fine I&#39;ve learned all the lessons the hard way actually pretty stoked for the next few years.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- Rules 14 on are from the comments and i thought were necessary. Also thanks to all for the support and kindness. I genuinely give 0 fucks about moon farming. Just don&#39;t want ppl to deal with the same helplessness I went through. I rarely post and the psychology and hate of the internet comment culture is so toxic and hateful. I&#39;m amazed but indifferent so do your worst.\nNot financial advice just opinion and my experience.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
