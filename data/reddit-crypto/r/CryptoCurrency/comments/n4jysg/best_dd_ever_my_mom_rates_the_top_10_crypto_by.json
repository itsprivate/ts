I tried to explain to her that’s not *really* how it works but you know, moms can be pretty stubborn so I let her do her thing. \n\nHere’s her rating of the top 10 coins based on their logo\n\n**1 - BTC**\n\nPretty basic, she likes the orange color but it could be done by a 12yo on paint with windows 98. \n\n5/10\n\n**2 - ETH**\n\nShe really likes this one, pretty, original design and makes her think of diamonds. \n\n9/10\n\n**3 - BNB**\n\nLooks like they tried to do a “futuristic” design but failed to do so, the yellowish brownish color used is not very pretty. It’s fine, but not great\n\n6/10\n\n**4 - XRP**\n\nPretty one, basic but efficient, curved lines of the “X” makes it elegant \n\n8/10\n\n**5 - DOGE**\n\nMeh. Not pretty, same as bitcoin, looks like it was made by a kid on paint. The color looks like diarrhea \n\n4/10\n\n**6 - USDT**\n\nThe green color is pretty, the T seems like it’s doing hula hoops with the circle around it, very healthy! \n\n7/10\n\n**7 - ADA**\n\nOriginal, looks like a star, she likes the design of it as it is a little bit different than every others \n\n8/10\n\n**8 - DOT**\n\nNothing original about it, basic P with a dot but it makes sense because of the name of it, it’s fine\n\n5/10\n\n**9 - UNI**\n\nPretty but a little bit childish in her opinion, too much details for a logo. A 10yo would buy it right away\n\n6/10\n\n**10 - LTC**\n\nAgain, basic paint logo made with windows 98, nothing original but the color used bumps up the rate a little bit\n\n5/10\n\n\n\nTo resume her amazing DD, ETH is first, followed closely by ADA &amp; XRP.  Let me know if you want more of these amazing mom’s DD",
