They post the victim and scammer addresses and go on about reaching out to law enforcement blah blah. If you have ever seen a real scammers account, there are usually tons of transactions and money being moved quick to avoid being black listed by exchanges.  The past few post ive seen, the &amp;#39;hackers&amp;#39; account has only 1 transaction. Seems strange doesn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;br/&gt;\nLet&amp;#39;s also take OP&amp;#39;s Reddit age into account .   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, not all post are scams but unfortunately, it only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.  With it being the holidays, people probably feel a bit more generous and want to help out someone in need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
