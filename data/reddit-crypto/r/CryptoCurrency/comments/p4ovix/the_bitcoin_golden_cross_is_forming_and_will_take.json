  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So you&#39;ve probably heard a bunch already about the Bitcoin golden cross, this is when the 50 day moving average (DMA) crosses above the 200 day moving average. Others are calling for it in just days or hours but this is incorrect because the 50 DMA is crossing the 100 DMA right now, not 200 DMA. However, Bitcoin is on track to have the 50 DMA cross the 200 DMA in mid-September.    </p>\n\n<p>The last time this happened was in May 2020 which led to the price of BTC going from $8,000 to a peak of $64,800 (a +700% bull cycle). That bull cycle recently ended with the big crash a couple of months ago in May 2021. We also saw a death cross (bearish opposite of golden cross) in June 2021 which led to the price dropping from $41,300 to the low of $28,800 (-30% bear cycle).  </p>\n\n<p>That bear cycle is ending as we speak and a new golden cross should form in mid-September which could propel BTC&#39;s price to the $80,000+ range and finally hit the big $100,000 price point people have been yearning for awhile now. It should happen around late Late January 2022 to early March 2022. So if you&#39;re feeling bullish on Bitcoin&#39;s recent history-making rally and upcoming golden cross you should still buy now and HODL, not in Sept or Oct when the new bull cycle is well underway. Let&#39;s keep this train rolling!   </p>\n\n<p>PS. I just noticed it&#39;s my 12th Cake Day! Shared with automod who is only 9, I&#39;m older than auto mod haha. To celebrate my 12th Cake Day I bought some Bitcoin for the upcoming golden cross!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
