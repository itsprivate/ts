  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why people in this sub don&amp;#39;t tell truth about their portfolios? Because many members are average or terrible investors so  success trigger them. And of course  a lot of scammers too. Everyone else need to lower the bar if  they want to be treated equally and don&amp;#39;t have spam in DMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are jealous creatures. Sorry to say but crypto, even this sub is full of losers that will downvote your every comment if they will see you as &amp;quot;lucky bastard&amp;quot;. They think more money other people make, less for them. Some people downote everyone for whole month  to earn  literally like 0.00001 moons more so don&amp;#39;t act suprised  top members don&amp;#39;t want to talk about big profits. They gain nothing from it, only risk and problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just check comments under any post  about profits. Main one always is &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have profits&amp;quot;, it is half joke and half sad truth that many people  wants to feel better. Comments about big profits get less upvotes and positive reactions that comments about little or no profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also no one would believe someone that tell  about really big profits. If guy that invested $8k into Shiba and earned billions or even &amp;quot;average whale&amp;quot; that have few millions in BTC would came here they would be ignored. Rich people have reddit too, but since it is internet unless they  doxxed themselves they have no chance to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Most people in this sub do much better than they describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
