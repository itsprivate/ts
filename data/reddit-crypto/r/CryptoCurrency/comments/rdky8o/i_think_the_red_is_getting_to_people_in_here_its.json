The spicier, the more likes, it’s pretty sad honestly. Idk if people are really this worked up or just farming to farm I honestly don’t care if your farming I do care if your that upset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys if you’re so heated and worried about the markets or others people opinions, like saying they don’t like a coin you love it’s ok! We all don’t need to agree. Try and have a little fun or better yet a decent discussion. Calling people names because they said they weren’t supper supportive or as hopium Jacked as you are on a coin is the power of discussion. It’s good to hear other people’s opinions once in a while especially those that differ from yours. Maybe let’s all just calm down a tiny bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I promise the negative and angry energy you are putting in these post will certainly carry into your real life. Put your selves in a slightly better head space or ya just gonna be angry. Soon your just gonna find your self yelling and arguing with everyone because your so used to doing it here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a breath and shit post or even better have a real discussion. The angry stuff isn’t doing anything for anyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: This level of anger suggests you are over invested and more importantly that you are very capable of making emotional investment decisions, neither of which are good. Your mental health matters and problems creep up they don’t just appear one day. Negative angry energy feeds negative angry pathways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
