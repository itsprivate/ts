I just saw a comment by a guy who said he was in his mid-40&#39;s and exclusively invests in crypto, and has yet to even begin retirement contributions.</p>\n\n<p>This only applies to people in the US, as I&#39;m not too knowledgeable about proper personal finance decisions in other countries - but I&#39;d recommend anyone to at least diversify so that you meet the maximum you can on all your tax-advantaged accounts. Take every cent of your employer/government&#39;s money that you can, and have some amount of safety for when you retire. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m 22 and have a semi-crap job that pays 45k a year but I still save about 15% of my take home pay specifically for retirement. About 10% of my pay goes in various cryptos. About 3 months pay sits in a high-yield savings account for emergencies, which I&#39;ll eventually move into I-Bonds once I&#39;m able to accrue a slightly larger emergency fund to account for the 1 year holding period - but once that&#39;s moved over you essentially have tax-deferred savings that&#39;s guaranteed to beat inflation indefinitely. To me, this is a far better use of my savings than just outright investing 25% of my income into crypto, despite earnings potential.</p>\n\n<p>That way, I have enough in crypto to literally change my life if it does pan out. If Bitcoin crashes and sends everything else down with it, I&#39;m not screwed and I&#39;ll still be able to retire with 2 million or so to coast on. I try to regularly take gains from less trustworthy cryptos (AKA anything besides Ethereum/Bitcoin, which I stake) till I reach a point where I no longer have any of my original investment in it. I take those gains and put them in a stablecoin so that I can reinvest whenever inevitable 25-30% dips happen (like yesterday). I occasionally will send the USDC I have to Coinbase so I can earn 4% XLM rewards on my normal purchases with the Coinbase card - only if that outweigh my credit card benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, the one thing we can rely on with cryptocurrencies <strong>IS</strong> volatility. You should not have so much invested in one place unless you are positive of earnings potential. Constantly keep your money moving, constantly take gains, and <strong>MAKE SURE TO DIVERSIFY SAVINGS FOR EMERGENCIES, RETIREMENT, AND CRYPTO</strong> - in that order.</p>\n\n<p>or don&#39;t, I heard /*<em>insert shitcoin here</em>/* is going to the moon ðŸŒ‘ðŸš€</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> don&#39;t be a dumbass and diversify</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
