Not only should you <strong>not</strong> return that money, you should see if he attempts this and once he does, sue him back into his mother&#39;s womb.</p>\n\n<p>His company offers him no protection, he made these threats under his own personal twitter account which directly places him in the crossroads of a lawsuit if he tries anything. Don&#39;t be afraid of his threats; If he tries <strong>anything</strong>, you will be walking away with an even larger airdrop, this time out of his own personal vault.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Don&#39;t return the money, sue him into the stone ages if he doxxes you.</p>\n\n<p>This money is <strong>legally</strong> yours.
