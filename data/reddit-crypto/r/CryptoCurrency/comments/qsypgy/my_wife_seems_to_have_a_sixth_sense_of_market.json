Beginners luck, I thought.<br/>\nThis went on for more than 7-8 times with slight variations. Again, I didn&#39;t pay much attention.</p>\n\n<p>Lately I&#39;ve been reading through different exit strategies and debating whether I should cash out in the bull cycle or keep everything staked and wait another 2-3 years. Having a baby on the way I felt like this is something we should discuss as a family.<br/>\nWhen brought up, she said:<br/>\n&#39;&#39;I think cashing out everything at once would be risking it too much to either be too late or too early, why don&#39;t you take out your initial investment when you&#39;ve got 2-3x and when things get heated pull out smaller chunks untill you have like 10% in for a greater risk. When this drop comes you can put back 40% for the next time and be left with 50% for fun money.&#39;&#39;<br/>\nMy jaw dropped.<br/>\nWOMAN, I&#39;ve spent literally days going through everything to come down to this strategy and you just spilled it on a saturday breakfast before you&#39;ve even finished your coffee!</p>\n\n<p>My wife is either a fuckin genious or she is hiding a ledger somewhere. No other way.<br/>\n<strong>Listen</strong> to your women guys, we may not know shit about fuck, but these creatures seem to know everything fucking thing in the universe!<br/>\nGod damned.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
