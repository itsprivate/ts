Coinbase is on the old one. There’s no disclaimer when creating an address. They put the disclaimer in the help section. Has anyone gone through something like this and gotten their money back? </p>\n\n<p>I’m honestly in shock. Idk what to do. Coinbase support is silent.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: They finally got back to me.....Now they&#39;re saying the address I gave them is not associated with my Coinbase account. This is an address they gave me to deposit into...It possible for them to give me an address that could work for a different token or are all addresses unique... Is this something to get a lawyer involved now? I can&#39;t lose this money.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: They are getting a specialist on it now after reviewing my request. Pray for me 😭😭😭</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
