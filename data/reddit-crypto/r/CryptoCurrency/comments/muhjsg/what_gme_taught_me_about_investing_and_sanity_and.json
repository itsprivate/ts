I was all about the whole “fuck Melvin, 🚀🚀🚀🙌💎” philosophy so I yolo’d all of my monies into GME  between $80-$120, it was good for about 10k\n\nThe “day of” when RH killed the game, I had over 5x and it happened within a week. I was fucking untouchable, I was a Golden god. I could do no wrong and I was actually trying to calculate the short term gains tax for when GME would hit $1000. \n\nIt was then that I learned when the money comes that quick and easy it is easy to lose respect for it. Two days later, I’m down 20k and I had the balls to laugh about that. I eventually left GME with a small profit but nowhere near what I had. \n\nI remember hitting a deep depression. I was able to spend all of that money I would have had in a matter of seconds. Suddenly I realized that was a car, a Bitcoin, a vacation. I spent it all in my mind only when I had none of it left. \n\nI say all of that to say this: some of you guys will hit stupid numbers, the type where you can easily say “this is life changing money.” If you get to that point, that point where your portfolio looks like a phone number, the euphoria is always present, you think you are a god damn genius and Elon-fucking-Musk is going to know your name, it might be wise to actually take those profits. \n\nThat story about the dude that shoved all in for 188k into Doge to clear 2M and is still going to hold is insane. \n\nYou don’t have to be the guy that flew too close to the sun, you can take profit and benefit the lives of yourself and other people around you at any point. \n\nQUITTING WHILE YOU ARE AHEAD IS NOT THE SAME AS QUITTING\n\nGood luck out there brothers and remember, you keep your own score. No rocket emojis will pay your bills, only you can set yourself free",
