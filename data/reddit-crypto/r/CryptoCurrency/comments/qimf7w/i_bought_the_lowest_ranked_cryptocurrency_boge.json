Every transaction 2% is burned and redistributed to token holders. The original DOGE uses mining which is electricity intensive, and has a large effect on our carbon footprint. BOGE being built on Binance Smart Chain is much more energy efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Supply: 2,000,000</p>\n\n<p>Initial Distribution\nIn order for the autostaking functionality to proportionally redistribute specific percentages to specific wallets, the initial coin distribution needs to reflect those percentages. The initial distribution of BOGE tokens is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>50% in burn wallet\n50% split between all holders</p>\n\n<p>Over time, the burn wallet will take more of a percentage of total holdings, and the coin will become more and more deflationary, sending the price higher.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Itâ€™s now moved 177 places in rank since I posted this ðŸ˜‚</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
