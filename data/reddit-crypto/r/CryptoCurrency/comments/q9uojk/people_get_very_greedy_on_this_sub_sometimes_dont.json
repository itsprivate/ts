I keep seeing posts about doing 2000x and never selling etc. but it&#39;s important to have realistic goals and sticking to them. If your plan is for example to buy a house &quot;hodling forever&quot; is just stupid. You need that house now, not in 20 years time. Plus having a house early will save you a ton of money on rent.</p>\n\n<p>I often compare my profit taking with traditional assets and I always feel good. I took some profits recently. Around 200+% on one of my coins and let me tell you at first I thought &quot;maybe I sold too early, maybe I should have hodled for longer? Everyone keeps telling me we are still early&quot; But then I compared it to my other investments and let me tell you, I&#39;ve never had any other investment return over 200% profit in my entire life. I&#39;ve made more with that single sale than I did in my entire life from investing. If I had to do this with my savings account or regular stocks it would take me years and I would probably never doubled my money.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s all about perspective. Have a goal. Realise gains once in a while. Maybe have some stablecoins waiting to buy the dip but don&#39;t feel bad if you&#39;ve sold earlier than everyone else as long as you are in a green, you&#39;ve won. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
