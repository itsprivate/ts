For their illegal activities.  And I&#39;m taking a stand now, and never using the ocean for anything again. </p>\n\n<p>The fact is, deep in international waters, there isn&#39;t much regulation.  There isn&#39;t enough eyes on it, and anything can be going on out there.    Especially pirates.    </p>\n\n<p>And I also think we should start monitoring everyone&#39;s bank accounts so we can catch people who are funneling money into these illegal ocean activities. </p>\n\n<p>So if someone tells you they like going in the ocean, remind them of all the illegal things that take place in it.    They should feel bad.     Educate them on the dangers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
