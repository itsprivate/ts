Are you recognize their  names?  thhere is a big companies? Familiar? Find out who those organizations are under the heading of \"investors\", look for related collaboration announcement, check how much they invested and what they got in return, large organizations do not just invest, they do comprehensive research, , check what is behind that investment and what is the value the the project give to those investors.\n\n**Customers**\n\nFor me this is one of the most important points, if a project has been running for a long time and does not get a few customers so the project is in trouble and we do not invest money in a project that is in trouble.\n\nWhen projects get customers, they announce it on social networks and on their website, they take care to update the investors, how many customers does your project have? How often is a new customer added? Who are the customers? Big companies? Small companies? Why did they become customers of the project? What value did your project give to the customer?\n\nFriends, if your project has no customers, it has no right to exist, very simply, like any other business.\n\n**Market cap**\n\nMarket capitalization is an important parameter for understanding the earning potential of your investment,the market capitalization can be found on a site like coinmarketcap.com under the Market capital column.\n\nThings to pay attention to:\n\nIf your project has a high market value and has no customers it is probably a project that at the moment what motivates it is mainly big hype and big expectation from investors, keep in mind that if the market value is high and there are no customers then the price of the project already includes future profits.\n\n**What is high market capitalization**? There is no answer to this, because the numbers can always be higher, at least check what is the ,arket cap of similar projects,  or better than that, competing projects\n\n**competitors**\n\nThere is almost no project that has no competitors, there are always projects that offer something similar, check who the competitors of the project, what is the current situation of the competitors? does the competitors already have customers and extensive adoption? What is the market cap of the project you are researching in relation to the market cap of the competitors? Does this ratio make sense?\n\nThe market cap is usually derived from the current value of the currency and the amount of coins in circulation. check the amount of coins the project has allocated? Is there a maximum limit? If there is no limit, if there is no limit is there a reasonable inflation that fits the technology of the project?\n\n**Weak points / Downsides**\n\nIf you focus only on the good things it will be difficult for you to make an informed decision, therefore, when you are researching a project you need to know what its weaknesses.\n\nHow will you find them?\n\nGo to YouTube, look for videos about the project, listen to the downsides they present, check whether these are indeed significant downside, are these the downside that the project team addressed? (maybe the tam addressing this downside in the roadmap, blog?)\n\nAlthough I love watching the videos of the coin bureau (the guy is a genius!) Do not watch videos of just one guy, listen to a few different videos and you will get different viewing angles.\n\nGo to Reddit , r/CryptoCurrency is prefer :) , and search the name of the project / currency you are researching, read posts and comments, see what other people think about your project, do they make arguments that make sense? Investigate and see if they are right.\n\nYou can also go nd visit the dedicated project subreddit but there you will mostly find positive posts with a lot of hype and \"to the moon\" :( \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck ü§ûüèª",
