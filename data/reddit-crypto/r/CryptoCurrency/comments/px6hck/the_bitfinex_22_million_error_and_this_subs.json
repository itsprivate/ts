One post asks &#39;What would you do if someone accidentally sent you $22 million?&#39;. And the most upvoted answers? See for yourself:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/oKdnsFJ\">https://imgur.com/a/oKdnsFJ</a></p>\n\n<p>Most of them would never return those funds. Some redditor even claim &#39;finders keepers law&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Some guy says &#39;honest miners would return. I wouldn&#39;t&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>In a regulated financial world, keeping that money would amount to an illegal activity at best. Yet this is apparently the commonly accepted behavior of these poor, downtrodden &#39;crypto investors&#39; with moral integrity so high they think they&#39;re cleaner than &#39;those filthy billionaires&#39; they love to whine about.</p>\n\n<p>The funny part is that the miner who mined those $22 million actually returned the money. There&#39;s another post about it. And in it, there are also a bunch of upvoted comments about how they wouldn&#39;t return the money:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/EGV7WNc\">https://imgur.com/a/EGV7WNc</a></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;I’m sorry but I definitely would not return it. That’s the freedom to live my life how I actually want to.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The whole reason Bitcoin exists is because rich folks have created and gamed the system throughout history and ripped us off along the way. Transaction fee in your error, collect your millions and go back to start :)&quot;</em> </p>\n\n<p>The absolute hypocrisy of the 2nd comment is actually something to behold. If the OP of that 2nd comment were in any position of power, you bet your hairy crypto ass he&#39;s going to abuses it as much as he can and plunder from whoever he can. He is whining about &#39;rich folk&#39;s gaming the system but he himself has no integrity either and is willing to commit a crime to become &#39;rich folks&#39; anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So the point of the story is this: None of us have any right to whine about the way the current system is fucked. None of us has any right to complain about how crypto only makes the rich richer. Because guess what? Given the chance, 99% of us would have done those some despicable things we love to whine about like a bunch of hypocrites. None of us actually has the moral integrity and goodness in us to do the same thing the miner did when he returned the funds honestly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
