The easiest bet to change your life for financial freedom </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/</a></p>\n\n<p>Harmony One is actually a bigger gap than all the crypto tech I&#39;ve seen.  And unlike my AMD vs Intel thesis Harmony is not just a few times better in design and tech it&#39;s possibly 100x+ better in tech.  And I said this many months ago before the price rose \n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pk5xso/bullish_on_harmony_one_rose_by_70_in_the_last_30/hc5agf8/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pk5xso/bullish_on_harmony_one_rose_by_70_in_the_last_30/hc5agf8/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/harmony_markets/comments/orwqk2/can_one_hit_01_this_year_or_next_year/h6ktbgb/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/harmony_markets/comments/orwqk2/can_one_hit_01_this_year_or_next_year/h6ktbgb/</a></p>\n\n<p>My investing thesis is always to find the best tech. I did this with AMD, TSLA and Harmony One is an even bigger gap.  </p>\n\n<p>That being said this is crypto, DO NOT buy on a day something is up 40% or up 150% in 40 days.</p>\n\n<p>This is crypto, it&#39;s worth watching it during the bear months and accumulating.</p>\n\n<p>Road Map</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/harmony_one/comments/q18hik/launch_dates_updated/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/harmony_one/comments/q18hik/launch_dates_updated/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbJdMIRcAM4&amp;list=TLPQMDgxMDIwMjGhpHBU2QSDLQ&amp;index=1\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbJdMIRcAM4&amp;list=TLPQMDgxMDIwMjGhpHBU2QSDLQ&amp;index=1</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
