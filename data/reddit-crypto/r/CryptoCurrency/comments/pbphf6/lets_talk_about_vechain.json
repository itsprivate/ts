Its here to develop a new type of supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>These utilities include</p>\n\n<p>Food safety\nBlockchain-based solutions could lead to a more transparent food economy around the world.</p>\n\n<p>VeChain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be deployed across the supply chain, including on products, vehicles, and warehouses. Then, environmental and location-based data from these devices can be uploaded, verified, and stored in a tamper-proof, decentralized manner on the VeChainThor blockchain. Solutions like this are already in effect for several companies, including Shenzhen Yuhongtai Foods.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-counterfeiting\nCounterfeiting in the luxury goods market is a serious problem. By attaching an encrypted chip and then using the chip to log and trace logistics, warehousing, maintenance, and resale, owners can be assured of authenticity. This has been used for luxury wine tracing for Shanghai Waigaoqiao Direct Imported Goods, and in testing for Renault luxury vehicle components.</p>\n\n<p>Health records\nHealthcare records systems are notoriously archaic. Instead of using inefficient and insecure record systems for lab results, this valuable data can be stored on the blockchain, with only patients and other authorized parties having access. A VeChain-based E-HCert App will be rolled out to patients of both the Mediterranean Hospital of Cyprus and Aretaeio Hospital in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Tracking carbon emissions\nBy driving carbon reduction by tracking carbon-emitting activities, this solution allows consumers to be involved in a carbon-saving scheme. </p>\n\n<p>When smart devices, such as cars or appliances show that a consumer is generating less carbon, they can then receive credits to be used on energy services. BYD, a Chinese electric car brand, already uses a Vechain solution.</p>\n\n<p>Source of utility cases: <a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-vechain-vet\">https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-vechain-vet</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen use cases of vechain popping up on the web for Covid-19 passports, tracking ingredients for the food industry from start to finish, car parts for car companies like BMW, tracking inventory at Walmart, Originality for shoe design, Tracking plastics for ocean clean up and soon vechain will have carbon trading.</p>\n\n<p>Vechain has massive partnerships including Fuji,BMW,SAP, Renault,Shanghai gas,Walmart\nList of partners: <a href=\"https://vechaininsider.com/partnerships/a-complete-list-of-vechain-partnerships/\">https://vechaininsider.com/partnerships/a-complete-list-of-vechain-partnerships/</a></p>\n\n<p>Companies will save millions of not billions by adopting this technology into their systems, I for one work in a lab an the company is a international mammoth. They are currently looking into technology exactly like this to track samples from start to finish and I would bet there are many other companies looking for this type of technology - once the younger generation starts moving up the ranks in companies like mine and making the decisions to adopt this technology it&#39;s game over. Because they actually understand what it can do.</p>\n\n<p>Vechain is long term hold, but man it&#39;s going to pop off.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
