Some of us hate to lose, even if those losses aren’t actualized because we’re holding. Some of us hate to lose a nickel or a game or Monopoly to a child. Some of us hate to lose at big stuff and small stuff alike. As adults, we learn to deal with this character trait in healthy ways. The hatred of losing drives us to excel, to do better next time. We learn to not allow it to make us depressed, or cruel, or to take it out on anyone.
