Almost nobody cares about tech, just about ''filthy fiat''. Celebrities with thousands of followers shilling shitty memecoins, a billionaire who manipulates the markets at its will, China FUD, making coins trending on Twitter, ''this time will be different'', and I can go on and on. It's all focussed on the idea of sucking as many new people into their coin, to later dump onto the ''Greater Fool''. Crypto was meant to be used, not being hoarded. Until a simple 140 character tweet won't move the market with billions of dollars I don't expect any real adoption (ofc there's some projects having some success in adoption, just very very little compared to the total crypto marketcap).",
