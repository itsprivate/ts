It is literally 90% of the time for some weird reason. By any chance are bots controlling the market that whenever someone buys, it will bring the price lower?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just want to get some consensus if anyone feels the same as I do. Though there are some coins in my portfolio that is in profit, I just want to know if there could be a possibility of me buying at the bottom in the short term!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate some tips from the fellow community on how to not buy at the top. Thank you everyone for your effort in commenting down below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr - Tired of buying at the top, would love some nice tips on how to better buy and predict the bottom&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
