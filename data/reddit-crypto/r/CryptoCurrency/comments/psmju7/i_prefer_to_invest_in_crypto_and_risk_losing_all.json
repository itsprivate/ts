And I can&#39;t find answer that would scare me or change  my mind. I am young,  university student. I  don&#39;t have  my own home,  car or job. I am not scared to end on street or under the bridge. I prefer this, because it will mean I at least tried to not be part of rat race.</p>\n\n<p>People work for  few k $, have to pay 30 years for their home and 2 cars. Wife, kids, dog and working 40 years 9-5 with 2 week holidays once a year. Free weekends, when you have a lot of things to do in home, few friends you see rarely, cause you are all busy, no time for yourself. This is what scare shit out of me, not losing money on crypto. I don&#39;t want to become small robot in huge machine called society, working for little bit  fiat,  when a some people live their dream lives.</p>\n\n<p>Many people are too afraid to risk and invest as much they can and HODL no matter what happen, because they believe it is  too risky. They prefer to settle for safe mediocre life. They do no risk, do not invest, do not ask  person they like for date, do not change terrible do job,  not throw all this shit to travel around the world, because they are too afraid to lose roof over the head and little bit of security they have. </p>\n\n<p>Someone told me that by investing in stocks I can be rich in 30 years. Many people like to tell this bullshit that by invesiting whole life, every month when you will retire you will have finally 1 or 1,5 million $... I am 22 years old, I don&#39;t want to be pawn on chessboard and see how world change around me when I work 30/40 years for my first big money. </p>\n\n<p>I prefer to invest in crypto as much as I can, achieve  my dreams, become rich, travel around the world, climb fricking Mount Everest or jump with parachute  and change the world for better, by supporting new technologies. I want to support finding cure for some untreatable illness, invest in space rockets, solar panels, electric cars, exosceletons, drones and everything that will help humanity. I want matter, even if I will have to took risk. Investing in crypto is still less risky  for me than living average life.</p>\n\n<p>It is of course my way, I do not advice anyone to do it. I just wanted you to see different  point of view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
