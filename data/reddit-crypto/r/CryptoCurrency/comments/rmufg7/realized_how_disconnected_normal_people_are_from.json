  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago my life drastically changed. Let&amp;#39;s say that I went to a job &amp;quot;preparation course&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t want to reveal anything else, so let&amp;#39;s stick with that. In there I was basically locked in with my co-workers for hours and hours straight, while having classes and things like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, while we are on a break, I start hearing people chatting about crypto, all started with someone saying &amp;quot;Ah better to invest in DogeCoin, I heard that it&amp;#39;s hot right now&amp;quot;, I continued to listen as I had nothing better to do. &amp;quot;Yes...&amp;quot; - Replied and continued another guy &amp;quot;... I&amp;#39;ve seen that I guy bought a pizza for eleven thousand BTC and now it&amp;#39;s worth Millions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a shock to me. Not the fact that they were talking about crypto, but that they are SO BEHIND in terms of news about crypto, they were basically lagging 5 to 7 months in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is the reality as it seems (I live in Portugal), I joined the conversation, whitout revealing that I&amp;#39;m invested in it myself. As soon as I tried to generally describe how crypto works, they were astonished. There are Stores that accept crypto? What? Impossible. A Country accepts it as legal tender? No way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped talking about after a bit, as I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know that I invest in crypto at all, but in the time that I did, I understood that we are still far from general adoption. I think the fact that we spend so much time researching crypto, makes us forget that other people have no time at all to do the same, so the only information that they get are recycled news.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
