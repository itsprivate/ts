And that’s the world right before everything completely hits the fan. \n\nYes, there is this beautiful world before Skynet rains fire down on us in which AI makes our lives simpler and radically transforms all of the analytical data available into a series of streamlined processes making our lives uniquely simple. \n\nNot to say our world will ever be perfect regardless of where technology is. Complications in implementation and a constantly shifting landscape will always prevent mass adoption from being a monolithic experience. But machine learning is our first step into the next level of automation and it will be the firms leading the charge, taking the risks, that both make our lives easier and their investors’ wallets fatter.\n\n**With that in mind, VAIOT is developing AI assistants in cooperation with IBM Watson to serve commercial applications ranging anywhere from legal, to brokerage, and even direct marketplace sales.** Having received a number of questions about how VAIOT integrates such a major piece of technology, the team explores that in great detail in a recent Medium post. By explaining just how IBM Watson works and how it fits in the puzzle of automating marketplaces, VAIOT makes the promise of AI clearer to see with just how seriously it can impact our daily interactions.\n\nTheir mobile app, available in beta, has already demonstrated their viability as a legal assistant, churning out binding contracts through seamlessly interacting with a digital agent. But even as impressive as that alone seems, the brokerage services they’re adding could prove to have even more promise.\n\nAfter all, as we’ve seen the success of Expedia and TD Ameritrade reach massive valuations as brokerages in their respective industries of travel and finance, we understand that success in the digital age lies in connecting people with the best deals quickly and efficiently. In a lot of ways, that’s what made Amazon the dominant presence it is today.\n\nWith the power of blockchain and AI, VAIOT is able to more efficiently source sets of data through the real-time price feeds of oracles such as Chainlink, weighing it quickly to make personalized suggestions that best suit the users needs.\n\nThat’s right, no different than how VAIOT’s voice assistant begins to learn your tone, dialect, and casual phrases, **VAIOT’s broker will be your agent, one that will eventually know you better than you know yourself**, tailoring your selection so that you only spend time shopping for what makes sense to you.\n\nYou can imagine how this would appeal to not only consumers who don’t want their time wasted with irrelevant offers, but to businesses looking to reach their target audience. Because of this, VAIOT’s multiple business lines gives them several paths to reap **first-movers advantage** in a variety of fields. This is not as simple as one product or one application, VAIOT can be what links the future of blockchain and AI in all of commerce through their solutions.\n\nCurrently running just over a $10M market cap, VAIOT has the vision, the resources, and plenty of room to grow with all of the positive momentum they have been seeing. It’s situations like this that offer the best buy opportunities as you can plainly see and invest in the foundation for success without having to pay for all the attention that comes with established history.\n\nBut if you want to wait, that’s perfectly fine too. With the trajectory of this bull run and the utility of these services regardless of the market, I expect VAIOT to be presenting good value as a buy for quite a while.
