But the real reason why I wanted to warn people is following.</p>\n\n<p>Only in 2021, there have been 14 recorded physical attacks on cryptocurrency holders. Sure that may sound low compared to cash robberies and such. </p>\n\n<p>Just to list a few recently recoded incidents involving crypto:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>March 18  <a href=\"https://archive.is/DpOQe\">Armed robbers steal iPhone, $5k at gunpoint</a> </li>\n<li>April 13  <a href=\"https://archive.is/GP76C\">Armed men assault home in Canada and steal crypto keys </a></li>\n<li>June 14  <a href=\"https://archive.is/CeCA8\">a trader was temporary blinded meanwhile HK 2$ Mil was stolen from him.</a></li>\n<li>July 1 <a href=\"https://archive.is/uIMAl\">Bitcoin holder drugged and robbed by Tinder date</a> </li>\n<li>August 8 <a href=\"https://archive.is/2kfpq\">Crypto trader who bragged on social networks murdered</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Most people who aren&#39;t familiar with cryptocurrencies think that if someone owns some crypto they are apparently rich. All they hear is the news about the price of Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum. This can make some desperate, greedy or simply evil people do very nasty things. Some people are willing to do crazy things to get money. This is not FUD on crypto, not even closely. It&#39;s just an advice to keep your investments to yourself, no matter how small.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m afraid that such incidents will get much more frequent every day with the mass adoption. It&#39;s smart to be vigilant. It&#39;s not a weakness or social disability or whatever people think it is, it&#39;s your strength and your safety measure.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Have a great Sunday my bestest lads and lasses ..<sup>and as painless Monday as humanly possible.</sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
