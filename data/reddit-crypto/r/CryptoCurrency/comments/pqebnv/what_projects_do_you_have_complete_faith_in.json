I would love to hear your reasoning, what the project consists of, what are the driving factors that keep you invested? Compared to most investors I am new to the space. I was way too late for Bitcoin, Ethereum. So about a 2 years ago I decided to get out of traditional stocks and join the crypto space. Some projects I am invested in are ADA, XRP, GRT.

Just came here to find out and spread awareness to the community around solid projects you have faith in. Looking forward to the comments!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
