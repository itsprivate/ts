For those who held and didn’t touch your moons during the previous month, you just earned yourself a 20% bonus! A common misconception however is that you will receive that bonus as additional moons. &lt;strong&gt;This is not the case&lt;/strong&gt; The bonus is applied to &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt;. This means that your karma got a 20% boost. Factor this into your calculations for this distribution and moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for the ones who don’t know how to get moons, simply open your vault on the reddit app and you’ll get moons! How you ask? Simply by receiving upvotes on your posts and comments in &lt;a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\"&gt;r/cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, it’s that easy! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mainnet is just around the corner and our wildest dreams and expectations &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; come true. I hope that the last distribution before 2022 was everything you hoped for and more. Have a moontastic New Year farmers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
