If you want to make x100 or x1000 gains it&#39;ll be up to you to study the cycles and follow your gut.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At some stage another bear market will show up, have a plan. Don&#39;t fomo in now unless it&#39;s projects you&#39;re gonna be in for the longer haul like Btc and Eth. Be prepared however, do not let it slip you by a second time. Of course it&#39;s impossible to catch all the best ones, but all you need is 1 in order for your life to be completely changed, it doesn&#39;t matter which one either, only the gains do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
