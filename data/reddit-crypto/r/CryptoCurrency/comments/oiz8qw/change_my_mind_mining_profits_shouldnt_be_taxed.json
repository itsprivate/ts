I kind of think that&#39;s bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>If you grow a carrot in your backyard, the IRS doesn&#39;t make you pay tax on that carrot based on the current market value of a carrot. It&#39;s not until you take that carrot to the farmer&#39;s market and sell it, (thus, converting it into US currency), that you have earned taxable income. </p>\n\n<p>If I use my own &#39;backyard&#39; (ie, the computer hardware), and pay for the &#39;water&#39; (electricity) to grow the carrot (mining rewards), then just hang on to the carrot, why am I being taxed on the carrot? When have I participated in the US economy besides buying the computer equipment (that I paid sales tax on), and paying for my electricity bill?</p>\n\n<p>When you buy a stock, if the price goes up, you don&#39;t pay capital gains tax on the current value of the stock at any given moment. You pay capital gains tax <em>after you sell the stock</em>. You haven&#39;t actually &#39;made money&#39; until you&#39;ve converted that stock <em>back into money.</em></p>\n\n<p>This seems really obvious to me, but I might be missing some of the finer points. For example, crypto is in fact a currency, and not a stock, but at least in my &#39;mine and hold&#39; strategy, I&#39;m certainly treating it as a stock.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
