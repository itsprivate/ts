Now I’m supposed to award people these useless coins because there’s nothing else to do with them? 😱🤣😳😭🤢🤮😵🥴😂  I’m feeling all the emotions right now lol</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: Thank you everyone for the moons and kindness 🙏🙏 I really wasn’t looking for a handout. Just wanted my moons back, but thank you to those that sent some! You’ve been given awards ☺️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
