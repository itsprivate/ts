To see their portfolio drop by 25% in less than 12 hours. They woke up with a quarter of their portfolio gone. </p>\n\n<p>Yes I do think this is just taking profits and a panic sale. Great time to stock up on crypto at a major discount. But still this is the crazy stuff that will keep crypto from being mainstream for awhile. </p>\n\n<p>Also another reason why taking profits is a good idea! If you don’t have fiat available. Maybe take profits next time so you’ll have spending money on the next dip. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone else get any good deals or catch the drop? Good luck everyone!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This is a good time to talk about a strategy I have. If you take profits you take them and convert to USDC. Then send them to Celsius, blockfi or crypto and let them earn interest. If a crash like this happens, you transfer them out and buy the dip.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
