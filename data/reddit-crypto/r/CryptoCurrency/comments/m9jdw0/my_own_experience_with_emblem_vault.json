This is both very on-trend for what's going on with NFTs but also has numerous future use cases to be explored and developed. They have an amazing looking website, a solid roadmap, a very active team (you can check their twitter @ CircuitsOfValue.\n\n     A very unique and useful product that works (you can check out their app too, through their website and overall huge potential for growth.\n\n     Also important to add, they are by no means a brand new, 1 week old project like some of the meme coins posted on here, but are still in the very beginning (and only about 60 million market cap). And just 600k total liquidity on Uniswap.\n\n     To do more research and for a link to buy on Uniswap, you can find all the info through their website www.CircuitsOfValue.com and the coin is called COVAL.\n\n     It has gone up about 211% in the last 7 days but still hasnt even come close to the 2018 all time high, not to mention its potential and/or use case around the NFTs trend alone. I highly suggest you check this project out, and DYOR of course.",
