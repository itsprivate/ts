And you sit there going, that scam is so obvious.  And it shocks you that if some guy just a looked a little deeper or just you know read something boom all unraveled.  It never gets off the ground.  </p>\n\n<p>I worry someday that all of this is just some elaborate scam cooked up by some Japanese Neet named Satoshi Nakomoto.  Who couldn&#39;t get out of his house to get a job so he told his parents he&#39;s working on a &quot;digital currency&quot; project and got em to invest so he could buy more anime.  Then his otaku friend took his parents letter about the project and put in on the internet explaining bitcoin.  And he was like dudr I don&#39;t have a project.  And thats where the scam came about, just put randome code on the internet and people will like interpret it how they will.  And then Satoshi was like what if they find me and he friend was like,  no one will ever know cause you never go outside.</p>\n\n<p>Then it got popular and Hoskins and Vitalik found out who Satoshi was because they met his friend at an anime con and he was all like bragging about it.  So they flew to Japan and told Satoshi were making our own crypto called Etherium.  And they kidnapped him and are holding him hostage in Hoskins basement and Vitalik wants to save but Hoskins knows the secret.  And they need Satoshi never to appear or it will ruin the mystery of Crypto.  And were right now in the part of the movie where like Vitalik saves Satoshi and he is going to come forward in a press conference and reveal the truth.  It was all scam!!!!</p>\n\n<p>I have that fear sometimes.  I also have the fear that I&#39;m going to be one of the guys at the beginning of the movie being interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: So crypto is a digital currency?</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yes</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: So you were told these numbers were money</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yes</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer:  You spent money on mining and buying coins from people on the internet for numbers in a &quot;wallet&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Me: Not your keys not your money.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: Thats not the point, you invested money on imaginary money.</p>\n\n<p>Me.  Fiat is imaginary.  My bank statement isn&#39;t real money.</p>\n\n<p>Interview But it can be turned into this. <em>Slams a 20 on the table.</em></p>\n\n<p>Me.  I could do that too?</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: By converting the coin on exchange for this 20.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yes</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: When you already had this 20</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yes</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: So you traded your money for magic beans?</p>\n\n<p>Me: Uhh </p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: Did anyone try to warn you this is a scam?  </p>\n\n<p>Me: Everyone</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: And?</p>\n\n<p>Me: I was told I was early.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: After 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Me:  Yeah</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: Is there anyone else you want to say to Satoshi or Vitalik or Hoskins who are being sentenced today?</p>\n\n<p>Me: Yeah, where Lambo?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
