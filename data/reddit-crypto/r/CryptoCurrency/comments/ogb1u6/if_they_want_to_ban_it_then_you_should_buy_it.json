And although it has much respect from most of the community, people are still hesitant. They&#39;re afraid it&#39;ll get banned or regulated out of existence. Afraid they&#39;ll get put on the terror watch list (half /joke). Afraid it won&#39;t go up in price. </p>\n\n<p>I could give a dissertation on why these risks are fairly minor (elsewhere I have); but instead, for the sake of argument let&#39;s even concede those risks and go from there. So okay, pretend we see major exhanges delist XMR. Govts flag you as a person of interest. And the price stagnates. </p>\n\n<h4>This is all the more reason to own and support Monero</h4>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but when the govt suppresses an idea who&#39;s time has come, I fight even harder. Obviously those ideas are a threat to their monopolistic ambitions; so if they ban or threaten to ban Monero, then obviously we&#39;re on to something important.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps even more important than madgainz, is holding an asset the govt <em>can&#39;t</em> censor, at least not at the protocol level. The whole point is to build and use technology that makes their censorship irrelevant. And with atomic swaps just months away, we&#39;re closer than ever.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I didn&#39;t get into crypto so that I can be a bitch to obeying what money the govt says I&#39;m allowed to own or use. They want to ban encryption?? Fuck them, I&#39;ll encrypt all my devices. They want to ban BitTorrent?? Fuck them, I&#39;ll use a VPN/Tor/I2P and download what I want. They want to tell me what kind of scientific/political opinions I&#39;m allowed to have on social media?? Fuck them I&#39;ll embrace their label as an &quot;extremist&quot; and join alternative platforms.</p>\n\n<p>You should allocate at some percenatage to XMR (held in your own wallet), <em>precisely because those risks are non-zero.</em> Because if freedom, censorship resistance, and challenging their monopoly on money are more than just talking points, then we ought to put our money where our mouth is.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
