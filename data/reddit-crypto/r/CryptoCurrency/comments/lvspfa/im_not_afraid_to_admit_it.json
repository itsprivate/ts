No.  I obviously want much more than that. \n\nI'm looking for a cool $500,000+ after tax, and thats my only purpose holding.\n\nI'm waiting for my ticket 🎫. I strongly feel it will come within good time.  Just waiting for my holdings to hit that 10x mark.  I understand not all  my holdings will go that route. After all, I have really heavy bags from 2017.  Especially APPC.   But a few others that have paid off during this boom.
