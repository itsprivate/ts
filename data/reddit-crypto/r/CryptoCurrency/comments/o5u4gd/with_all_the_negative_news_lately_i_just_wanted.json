But I wanted to take a moment to personally thank <a href=\"/u/jonas_h\">/u/jonas_h</a> for helping me get copies of his cryptocurrency education books so that I could work to donate them to all of the local libraries in rural Southwest Missouri and Northwest Arkansas. He and I corresponded back and forth for the past month or so and helped me get some books directly from the publisher and I have already began distributing them to all the local libraries in my area. I think using traditional ways to spread crypto education such as libraries will help included and educate our disadvantaged and less technically inclined groups in rural America. So if you get down about the value of your coins remember crypto is and always will be something great for everyone to share!</p>\n\n<p>Below is the picture from our first shipment of books to go out to local libraries!\n<a href=\"https://i.redd.it/2n8eyq6q2v671.jpg\">https://i.redd.it/2n8eyq6q2v671.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
