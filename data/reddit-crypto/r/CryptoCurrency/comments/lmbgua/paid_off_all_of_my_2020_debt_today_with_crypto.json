I had to get rid of my dream car for something more affordable. Also accrued quite a bit of credit card debt as well as a few personal loans during the pandemic. With the start of the new job it was daunting thinking of how to pay these down. So, I got involved with crypto trading again end of December with a very small investment into Lumens at .11 a coin. Made it a point to invest whatever I could comfortably invest every paycheck. Bought more Lumens, bought whatever bits of BTC I could, bought some doge (before Elon tweeted, glad he did), and then some VET and VTHO. Also started using my PC to mine small amounts of ETH while I was at work. This last month or so has been incredible. Seeing the small bits I put in grow to what they have has allowed me to breathe a sigh of relief. I started collecting my profits and just got the final payment confirmation for the last unpaid credit card. All of 2020 debts, gone in 2 months. Thanks to crypto and its communities. I know that crypto is way larger than the dollar amounts they trade for, and I truly believe that blockchain is the future. Crypto hasn’t made me a millionaire, but I sure do feel like a million bucks.",
