  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying crypto was my first kind of investment. It was a few years back when I had the &amp;quot;everything will 30x&amp;quot; mentality. Reality slapped me across the face, 2018 bear run happened, my investment did not 30x, and I lost more than I care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s (obviously) brokers that deal with stocks and whatnot where I live, but nothing that would be available to me as I want to do it myself. Unless I&amp;#39;m a certified broker, I can&amp;#39;t do it. Unless it&amp;#39;s a minimum of XX amount, I can&amp;#39;t do it. Unless I have plenty of time to do all the administrative stuff (go there, certify that, call them, sing this etc) I can&amp;#39;t do it. So crypto was there, and I started. Few $/€ here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve grown. I&amp;#39;m not pretending I know a lot about the tech, or the TA. Patterns? Too much for me. Or, better put, not reliable in crypto where a tweet from someone makes or breaks the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my point (oh, finally, he gets to his point) is - what is the alternative? Not invest in crypto? That&amp;#39;s like refusing to use a mobile phone. Refusing to use the internet. Refusing to get a smart phone. There is no escape from this. It will make a significant part of our lives. You can look the other way for some time, but not for long. Every single investing &amp;quot;authority&amp;quot; said in the last year &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;d be foolish not to have crypto in your portfolio&amp;quot;. Not that I trust them, but it shows that even the hardcore haters have come around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are fads and scams everywhere. Which new technology did not have early adopter hiccups? Crypto is here. It&amp;#39;s not going anywhere. And I&amp;#39;m here too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
