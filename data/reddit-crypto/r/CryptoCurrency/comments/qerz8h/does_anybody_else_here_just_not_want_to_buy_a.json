It is my dream to live abroad permanently.  I don&#39;t want to live in my home country so the idea of buying a house and renting it out so I can go live abroad without losing money is just a nightmare to me.  When I got into investing and crypto, it seems to me that the gains I would get from crypto and stocks if I play it right would be just as good as investing in a house. Ideally both would be good but I am going off the income I have now. </p>\n\n<p>What is your situations or feeling about the property thing</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
