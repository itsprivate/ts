  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The US debt currently sits at more than 28 Trillion dollars. This is 140% of the US GDP. There is absolutely no way the US can pay this much debt off without devaluating the dollar. The US has already printed more than 50% of its dollar supply in the last 2 years alone. We are already seeing supply shocks happening and inflation rising.</p>\n\n<p>It won&#39;t be stopping anytime soon either. The US keeps touching its debt ceiling faster and faster and the debt is rising exponentially. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o0bl8z7u8bv71.jpg?width=910&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9110b2bca502cfdb3d2ddc7f37801609f4f6f2\">https://preview.redd.it/o0bl8z7u8bv71.jpg?width=910&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9110b2bca502cfdb3d2ddc7f37801609f4f6f2</a></p>\n\n<p>Just in case you forgot earlier, in order to pay this debt, the US will have to devaluate the dollar significantly. Guess what happens when the US dollar devaluate? Other countries will also follow. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Currencies pegged with the US dollar</strong>: Aruban florin, Bahamian dollar, Bahraini Dinar, Barbadian dollar, Belize dollar, Bermudian dollar, Cayman Islands dollar, Cuban convertible peso, Djiboutian franc, East Caribbean dollar, East Timor centavo coin, Eritrean Nakfa, Hong Kong dollar, Jordanian dinar, Lebanese pound, Netherlands Antillean guilder, Omani rial, Panamian balboa, Qatari riyal, Saudi riyal, United Arab Emirates dirham, Venezuelan bolivar.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway from this is that Cryptocurrencies are going to be extremely valuable in the future. You probably already know this, but Crypto is going to be more valuable than what you currently think because not only is there significant inflation already, it is only going to get worse as countries have to pay off their debt. </p>\n\n<p>The US isn&#39;t alone in their debt crisis however. Almost every country has to inflate away their debt. The inflation we are seeing currently is nothing considering what might come in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hbjxq4ahbbv71.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c57542af8aacf7ada28e9cb35a5273601f70875\">*significantly more as of Q4 21</a></p>\n\n<p>How do you think the world is going to pay all this debt off? Short answer, it can&#39;t. Inflation is going to be huge. Crypto is currently the best way to avoid inflation. Crypto literally has deflationary currencies right now while some countries are facing severe inflation. Crypto is one of your only bets to survive the coming inflation. The inflation we are seeing currently is severely underestimated as the CPI doesn&#39;t count the housing market and other assets that have ballooned in the last 2 years alone.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Countries are going to have to inflate their currencies to pay off their debt (especially after the pandemic, we are already seeing a huge inflation rise) and one of the only ways you can avoid inflation and take advantage of the situation is to invest in Crypto. Invest while you can because inflation will ruin your financial condition in the future if you keep holding your wealth in fiat.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
