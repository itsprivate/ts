So far I’m up over 100-250% on multiple coins in the last 2 months and taking profits is the hardest part, due to the fact that I’m worrying about missing out on more gains. </p>\n\n<p>So what are some recommendations for me and others about taking profits. What types of goals do you set for when you want to cash out, do you wait till your up X% amount and then take out your initial investment or do you take out 20% for example and then as it continues to rise X amount more you take out another 20% or so?</p>\n\n<p>Please share some helpful tips.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
