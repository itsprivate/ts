It was BTC/USDT for the ones guessing. I f.cked up with greed once before but it was in spot so not much was lost, this time i think i got my lesson (i hope).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: It was on futures not margin. I don&#39;t exactly know the difference, i just know i lost my own money not a borrowed one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
