But lost in a lot of the comments is the fact that the price of MOONs <em>right now</em> doesn&#39;t mean much for a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The trading volume of MOONs is extremely small. While these numbers might not be completely accurate, if you look at coingecko the 24hr volume of MOONs is ~$9,000.</li>\n<li>Perhaps most importantly, Coingecko lists the +2% depth of ~$400. This means that a <strong>buy order of only $400 can move the price by 2%</strong>. If you look at most coins in the top 100, you&#39;ll see +2% depth of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. So congratulations! If you have a few hundred dollars you can be a market moving whale!</li>\n<li>The population of people trading MOONs right now is not representative of the general population. The people buying/selling MOONs are those that are willing to go through a somewhat technical and convoluted process. It&#39;s not far-fetched to think that they might have a different (higher or lower I don&#39;t know) value of MOONs than the general population using coinbase or (gasp) robinhood.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All this is to say that I&#39;d encourage members of this sub to stop paying so much attention to the price of moons for the time being. Once it hits some exchanges with real volume we&#39;ll have a much better sense about how much our shitposting has earned us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
