I wanted a way to earn passive income on my BTC, ETH, BNB and some other large holdings I own. I&#39;m not comfortable staking my ETH towards 2.0 at this time. I wanted an option that paid out daily and it was important I could remove my funds anytime. I found a solution I love.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thrilled that a few days ago I officially passed the $1000 interest mark! That&#39;s right, $1000 earned from doing absolutely nothing. $1000 that is compounding and earning interest now too!</p>\n\n<p>The funny thing, my friends all laughed at the APR rates (6.5-12%) when I told them about the solution I found. I believe one friend said &quot;Those are weak returns man...&quot; Well, those weak returns can pay a few mortgage payments if I decided to liquidate...</p>\n\n<p>There is something gloriously amazing about earning a passive income from your crypto. It&#39;s addicting.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have your crypto working for you! Don&#39;t be afraid of staking / lending. Start researching it and ask questions. So many amazing redditors are here to help.</p>\n\n<p>//EDIT - LFG!!!! Due to the market pump, my interest payments have reached ATH of $1197 which I just converted to USDT. Win win baby!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
