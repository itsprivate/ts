Each year money laundering, drug trafficking etc. account for less and less of cryptocurrencies transactions (lower than half percent in 2020) while the &quot;innocent&quot; cash is used for an extremely larger amount of illicit activities.</p>\n\n<p>You hear people with power like Christine Lagarde come out and say stuff like that and it makes you angry at first place. But if you sit down and rethink, this is good for us long term. They try to dispute us with all they can, most of the times with unbelievably ignorant means which makes them look even more stupid and helpless against crypto.
