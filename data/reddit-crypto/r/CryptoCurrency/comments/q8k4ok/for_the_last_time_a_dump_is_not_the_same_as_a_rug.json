There&#39;s buy and sell orders left and right. Volume is $3B. You will be able to sell. If you bought in the last 7 days, there&#39;s 50% chance you&#39;re still in profit. But please, for the love of Satoshi, zoom the f out. It&#39;s price is still above where it was 7 days ago. 1 month chart looks pretty amazing, even for the most volatile of crypto.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Is this a dump? Who the f knows?? It most likely is. It could also be a normal correction from the wild pump it had the previous month. We don&#39;t know. Sensationalist articles and posts here how it&#39;s getting sold left and right are not looking at the number. 16% fall today is a lot. That said, we didn&#39;t blink an eye in any other situation where a top 100 coin fell 16% in a day. Or are you forgetting this is crypto?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: the serial downvoting happening in comments is atrocious.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT #2: some people are advocating calling a rug pull when team/dev deliberate actions cause the price to sharply fall down (by underdelivering or not working on the project at all, or by holding a large portion of the supply then selling it all at once etc). I would tend to agree, as the crypto language/dictionary is young and is still developing (or is not properly defined). </p>\n\n<p>I still remain with the point that not all dumps, scams, hacks or code flaws are rug pulls. All thumbs are fingers, not all fingers are thumbs type of thing, if you will. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
