If you look at the BTC/USDT chart from Binance, we never failed to retest a long wick to the downside, ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we have a 42k wick, but haven&amp;#39;t retested the level yet, which is why I&amp;#39;m expecting a dip to the downside before any significant rallys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History often doesn&amp;#39;t repeat itself, but it rhymes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Bearish on BTC till we retest 42k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Apparently I&amp;#39;m getting downvoted for having normal conversations in the comment section, thanks &lt;a href=\"/r/cc\"&gt;r/cc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
