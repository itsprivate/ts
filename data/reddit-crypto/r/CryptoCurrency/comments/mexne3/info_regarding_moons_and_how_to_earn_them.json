If you are on the reddit app go to your profile and activate the Moon vault! \n\nIirc you can only do it on the app and you have 6 months to claim your moons in the vault.\n\nPost Karma - Each upvote/downvote has 1 karma, unless it is a meme or media, then it is 10%.\n\n\nComment Karma - Each comment upvote/downvote gets 2 karma since the there was a proposal to make comments give 2x karma that passed.\n\n\nKarma limit - limit of 1000 karma per post or comment.\n\nWhen do you get the moons? - Moons are distributed every 4 weeks \n\nWhat is the current ratio? - The ratio normaly get lower each month for an example last one was 0.42 which means 1 Karma equals to 0.42 moons, the one before that was 0.52 and the one before that was 0.87.\n\n\nProposal regarding moons that got accepted.\n\n\n20% bonus : If you don't move out your moons, you get +20% on next \ndistribution.\n\n\n5% voting bonus : This one is passed but not official yet. If you vote on proposals, you'll get +5% on next distribution.\n\n\nYou can also look up moons on Coingecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon ) \n\nTo see how much they are worth and where they are listed, and the total supply of moons that will be released (out of 250m around 60 is 'released')\n\nEdit: The ratio is dynamic and don't necessary have to get lower but considering it went lower the last 5-6  month i assume it will continue get lower.",
