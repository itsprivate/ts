I’ve changed my perspective on money. Being almost 21, I want to get ahead and pave a way for my future. I’m thinking before I spend my money: “is this a need, or a want?”. “Do I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need this?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that money I &lt;em&gt;would’ve&lt;/em&gt; spent on useless items, I’m now relocating into crypto, (and other means of investments as well). I’m taking my time to research what I’m buying, and thinking long term; using that money to make me &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may be easier said than done, but it’s absolutely doable. I’m glad I took this path before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
