Personally, I have two separate notebooks in two places that are guarded from weather and fire because I don&#39;t keep any of my recovery info stored digitally.  I began doing it because I wondered what would happen if I died unexpectedly, and I realized nothing would.  My wallets would just sit untouched for the rest of time.  If I kick the bucket, I want to make sure my family is taken care of, and so I also created a dead man&#39;s switch.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds cooler than it is (it&#39;s still pretty cool and makes me feel like James Bond) but you can go to google inactive account management <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/inactive\">https://myaccount.google.com/inactive</a> and make a plan for when your primary email account is inactive for X amount of time.  If you don&#39;t log in for that period or show any sign of activity, an email can automatically be sent out to a predetermined list.  Your wife, your parents, your best friend, etc.  My automated email provides directions on how to recover my wallets and where to find my recovery information.</p>\n\n<p>I thought this was a pretty cool and easy to set up feature and could change the lives of your loved ones if something were to happen to you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
