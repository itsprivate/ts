Guess what? For you guys, I want to share a really great technique on <strong>When to Purchase any Coin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a guide comparing DCA to my technique. Please read carefully if you are really looking for maximum profits out of your investments.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Let&#39;s begin.</h1>\n\n<p>I am Joe, I have $400 to invest. Someone on Internet told me to start with DCA and I am doing real good until one day, <a href=\"/u/ImThour\">u/ImThour</a> showed up with his technique on how to buy any coin at right time. Here is a quick difference of <strong>Average Cost of Buying</strong> via DCA and His Technique.</p>\n\n<h2>Average Cost via DCA (Bought $100 worth of BTC Every Monday): $34174.25</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ui7HXXn.png\">Check Chart For Dates</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Day 1 (5th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $35274</li>\n<li>Day 2 (12th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $34264</li>\n<li>Day 3 (19th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $31780</li>\n<li>Day 4 (26th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $35379</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Average Cost via His Technique (Bought $100 worth of BTC each Time): $32545.5</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/apcTxRJ.png\">Check Chart For Dates</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Day 1 (5th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $33590</li>\n<li>Day 2 (8th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $32659</li>\n<li>Day 3 (13th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $33095</li>\n<li>Day 4 (20th July, 2021): BTC Bought @ $30838</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Damn, That&#39;s a difference of almost <strong>$1628.75</strong> in Average Cost of Buying.</h2>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1><strong>What&#39;s the technique?</strong> It&#39;s really simple.</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/\">https://www.tradingview.com/chart/</a></li>\n<li>Select your Coin you want to buy</li>\n<li>Set Chart Timings to 4 Hours</li>\n<li>Click on Indicators and add Stoch RSI</li>\n<li>Only Buy when Stoch RSI crosses each other below 20.</li>\n<li>That&#39;s it, you have bought at the perfect time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading till this sentence. Not sure if someone posted this before or it&#39;s an exclusive to this subreddit. I have never seen someone suggesting this before and surely, it&#39;s an easy way to invest in most of the coins in the market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
