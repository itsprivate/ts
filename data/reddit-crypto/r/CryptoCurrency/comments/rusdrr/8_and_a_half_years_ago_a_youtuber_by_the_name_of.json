  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 9th, 2013 youtuber Davincij15 made a 6 minute video going over what Bitcoin is, and it’s potential, in his opinion at the time and pleaded with his audience to just buy $1 worth and leave it in a wallet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of you don’t believe in the Bitcoin system and that’s fine. You can stay on the sidelines. But if you really want to become wealthy in the future I would suggest you take one frickin dollar, one dollar and buy some Bitcoin and put in a god damn wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, out of curiosity I can’t help but wonder the obvious question of what would have happened had I put just $1 into Bitcoin or 5 or 20 etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I could not find the exact price of Bitcoin for May 9th 2013 when he uploaded the video. CoinMarketcap showed me May 5th and 12th and Coingecko showed me May 6th. The price was fluctuating between 110-115. I met in the middle with 113.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Bitcoin at $113&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Dollar amount invested&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;Value now&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;$1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;$415&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;$5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;$2,079&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;$20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;$8,318&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;$100&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;$41,592&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;$170&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;$70,707&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I included $170 because May 9th 2013 was a day after my birthday. I had just turned 18 and gotten my first tattoo for about that price. I did not know anything about Bitcoin but If I could time travel I’d tell my past self “fuck the tattoo, get this magic internet money!” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do any of you remember his video when it came out? If so, did you buy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
