So instead of ETH I’m shifting towards things like Raven cause they still have more potential. And instead of ALGO I’m shifting more towards BitDAO especially considering that they’re still very new and already have the largest treasury in the market and they’re gonna use it to make their tokens one of the most powerful in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I’m leaning more towards new projects but with real concepts and backing behind them cause even if ETH reaches 10k or BTC reaches 100k, that’s only a 2x&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
