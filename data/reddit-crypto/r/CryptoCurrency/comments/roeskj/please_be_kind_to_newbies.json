The most important lesson I&amp;#39;ve learnt is to accept advise and opinions from this site with a grain of salt. Still, I believe it is critical that we be welcoming to newcomers and respectful when they ask what some may consider a silly question (s). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all need to learn something, and I feel the best way to learn is to ask questions. When someone new to crypto asks a question, we shouldn&amp;#39;t be rude or condescending. I realize some of it can be found on google, but I honestly feel people just want to fit in and have conversations with people who share their interests. In the real world, where many people still believe crypto is a scam, that&amp;#39;s difficult to come by. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is all I&amp;#39;m saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s treat each other with respect and be kind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
