This is any crypto that I haven&#39;t personally bought.</p>\n\n<p>My methods:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase Earn:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You earn free crypto by watching a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it, in return you receive between $1-$3 dollars for each one.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2020 I did majority of the Coinbase earn rewards, this was roughly <strong>$32</strong> at the time, and is now <strong>$188</strong> of my free crypto. Which is up this month 17.58%.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qpykdff9kse71.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=604a69faa897af51ef27cb2700dba15bc630c966\">https://preview.redd.it/qpykdff9kse71.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=604a69faa897af51ef27cb2700dba15bc630c966</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Staking:</strong></p>\n\n<p>PoS (Proof of Stake) is the concept that a person can mine and or validate block transactions according to how many coins they have. So more coins you own = more mining power you have.</p>\n\n<p>This is currently what I&#39;m working on building up right now, I mainly stake ETH and DCA into ETH every month to stake more. Most of the other coins were converted to ETH so my staking is largely driven by it.</p>\n\n<p>With the current price increases my staking rewards are up <strong>40.47%</strong> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c1bchem4lse71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed17f14eb9e18227675bcaa10d05bfb8076ce48\">https://preview.redd.it/c1bchem4lse71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed17f14eb9e18227675bcaa10d05bfb8076ce48</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Automated Rewards:</strong></p>\n\n<p>These are rewards that require none of my attention.</p>\n\n<p>Mining - I Use the GamerHash, This just uses spare computing power from a Desktop I&#39;ve had for years and my gaming laptop when I&#39;m not using it. Recently I&#39;ve been getting around ~.034 mBTC a day.</p>\n\n<p>I also converted 58.5 BAT I earned into BTC which was added to the table to show the conversion / amount made from that.</p>\n\n<p>Brave Rewards - I wrote a script that automates the BAT rewards, I ended up getting more than previously thought last month since they ran into an issue with the amount of bat given per ad and was corrected when paid out, but Brave allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads on their chromium browser, both on PC and mobile (I also earn Bing Rewards through this method as well)</p>\n\n<p>All in all, these rewards are up <strong>43.38%</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ucdpl1dsmse71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b4044e8a75f63a90918d1c853ec79871a094770\">https://preview.redd.it/ucdpl1dsmse71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b4044e8a75f63a90918d1c853ec79871a094770</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reddit Moons:</strong></p>\n\n<p>These don&#39;t need an introduction, earn by being active in this community. Of course these have been on a winning streak lately, up <strong>76.32%</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/623is5k2ose71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303a85cae27bc40c1e8f0b7956d042d316928d84\">https://preview.redd.it/623is5k2ose71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303a85cae27bc40c1e8f0b7956d042d316928d84</a></p>\n\n<p>Coinbase Card:</p>\n\n<p>Next is my newest method, my Coinbase debit card where I earn 4% back in XLM on my everyday purchases. This is of course up 100% since this is my first month using it and being 0 last month.    </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1efmmktiose71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87fb4847521f040b67bdc5ca1d2d9f093b7984d7\">https://preview.redd.it/1efmmktiose71.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87fb4847521f040b67bdc5ca1d2d9f093b7984d7</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Total:</strong> $1,541.90 (62.82%)</p>\n\n<p>Since last month my free crypto has gone up <strong>62.82%</strong>, there is no plans to sell or stop since this is all generating free crypto. I may eventually convert more BAT to BTC or ETH to stake more this month.</p>\n\n<p>Coinbase Earn: +17.58%</p>\n\n<p>Automated Rewards: + 43.38%</p>\n\n<p>Staking: +40.47</p>\n\n<p>Reddit: +76.32 </p>\n\n<p>Coinbase Card: (1st Month)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/45c6m0x4rse71.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e3739814ce7cc6520bb0c083b7aae0c473cc14f\">https://preview.redd.it/45c6m0x4rse71.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e3739814ce7cc6520bb0c083b7aae0c473cc14f</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
