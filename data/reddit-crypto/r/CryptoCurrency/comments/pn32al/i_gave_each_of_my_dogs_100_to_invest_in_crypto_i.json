Like the title says, I &quot;gave&quot; each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto and plan on giving them the rewards (probably in the form of special treats, food, toys) when they reach the appropriate age. </p>\n\n<p>For practical reasons I did not create accounts for them in an exchange, we will be using my account instead and I will be managing their funds for the time being. Just imagining how long the verification (kyc) process would take for them gave me a headache. Moreover, my dogs are still not very good using the keyboard or touchscreens, so it made more sense for me to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Even though I am technically managing the funds for them, they were actually the ones who decided which projects were worth investing in. In order to save time I decided it would be best to show them the logo of each crypto and read them the name, if they barked, that meant they wanted me to buy some. I decided to allocate their $100 in three equal parts among the first 3 projects they barked at. This way they would have a diverse portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>The results were the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gandalf the Beagle (DOGE, CAKE, SHIBA)</li>\n<li>Attila the Pug (DOGE, BAT, ADA)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Like I said, the decision was theirs, I have to respect it. Gandalf was probably just hungry at the moment and thought I was offering him cake and the sight of a doge and shiba dogs made him happy. Attila probably chose doge for the same reason, and I guess he reacted at the word &quot;bat&quot; because he hates bats. At first I was surprised when he chose ADA. I thought he had probably been reading up on the project and read about the smart contracts being implemented today. Now I just thing he though I said &quot;ADA BOYYY&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I will let you know how these investments turn out, remember it&#39;s important to think about your pets&#39; financial future as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
