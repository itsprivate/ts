So many time it could rise in price, but nada...what more bullish news does a coin need to go up? I held VET, but dropped it when it reached $0.15 a month ago; I&amp;#39;ve bought it at 0.17, sold for a loss because I&amp;#39;ve lost faith in this project. Also a lot of China&amp;#39;s fault that this coin is so underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think, what coin will remain under their expectations in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
