So someone decided today was the best day to do a rug pull! &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/muskswap/\"&gt;Muskswap&lt;/a&gt; just took a 95% dive on Christmas Day! Happy holidays to everyone in this sub, yet more proof why you shouldn&amp;#39;t buy coins based on their name. I got quite a lot through an airdrop, but like Squid Game there was a catch - the coins were locked until the New Year. Now we know why. Any coin where you can&amp;#39;t sell should be treated with suspicion as it&amp;#39;s a total red flag and should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: To clarify, I didn&amp;#39;t buy any, had some airdropped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
