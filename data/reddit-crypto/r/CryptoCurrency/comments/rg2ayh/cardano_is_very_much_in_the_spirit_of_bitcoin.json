In bitcoin there is also a scripting language but it&amp;#39;s not turing complete (curious fact, it is harder to create a non turing compete language. For example, turing complete languages were sometimes created by mistake when some tech was created!).It is true that this scripting language in bitcoin was non turing complete by design but I see Cardano&amp;#39;s extension as the next logical step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing about the consensus algorithm is that it&amp;#39;s secure and decentralised. Cardano&amp;#39;s Proof of stake algorithm is proven to be at least as secure as Bitcoin&amp;#39;s proof of work algorithm. Also, It can even be said that Cardano is &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; decentralised due to it&amp;#39;s many pools/evolving governance/etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I really think that there is a lot of merit to Cardano if you look objectively into the tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
