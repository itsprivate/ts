An expert will come in a rearrange furniture or rent furniture out to give the house an appeal that results in FOMO.   Like you're getting all that nice shit?  Nah. \n\nWe have 12 bushes in front of our house and I never really have a shit about them. I really don't give a FK about what my house looks like because of these bushes.  Whos it impressing?  In fact I was considering ripping them out anyway, and putting down cheaper ones that look nicer and cost only $50 a piece. \n But I never once thought the current bushes had any value until today... \n\nWas talking to my landscaper and he made a comment after I said I hated those bushes... \"I planted all these...wish I would have taken them when the owners left, everyone is asking for it\". \n\nI said oh yeah? Why how much do they go for? \n\nHe tells me at that size he can get about 500-600 a piece easy, and labor on top of it.\n\nYou got to be fucking kidding me?  I also had about 10 or so of them in the back yard and a few on the side of the house. \n\nI told him will you take them for $250 each and plant the cheaper once I wanted instead?\n\nHe gladly agreed. So now I'm getting $6000 and new ones that I want on top of it.  I told my wife , and it was a no brainer.   I also have tons of rocks that I'm dumping off too.  \n\nFK landscaping anyway.  More bushes more bugs, to me it's old people shit. They do nothing for my life.  They are essentially shit scam coins to me, and I have to stare at them everytime I look out the window.  $600 ???, they give me nothing in return and I have to maintain it?  Fk type of investment is that?  The maintenance cost out weighs the return. They take up space.   Get em the FK out of here.    Yes I'm buying some moons too.  \n\nThis is like a no risk situation for me. I get rid of stupid posh shit I don't want for stuff I do want and money.     I honestly would have never known the Bush's value if I did not mention anything about hating them.  \n\nSo yeah. People want to FOMO over bushes that much.  Fk it. I'll take their money.   Stupid.\n\nWho would have thought their bushes could be used to go lambo?  Obviously not the no coiners buying them.",
