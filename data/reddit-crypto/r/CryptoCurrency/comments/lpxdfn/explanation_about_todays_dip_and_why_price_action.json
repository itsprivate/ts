If large amount of positions are liquidated a market squeeze can occur.\n\n Market squeeze - When a large number of traders are forced out of their positions due to sudden rising or falling prices, causing more traders to close their positions. This usually called long/short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Back to Crypto markets today:\n\nThe amount of BTC futures contracts positions reached all time high \n\n[Amount of Futures positions](https://preview.redd.it/ne1vyv6aq2j61.jpg?width=929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60288e64e56cc6afdded1e920f25ed58c3edf672)\n\nNow lets take a look about how much of those positions got liquidated today -\n\n[See full data here](https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData)\n\nAn equivalent of $3.74B long positions got liquidated over the last 24hours when $2.16B of them happened in a matter of 30 minutes, during that period BTC hit the low of $47,500.\n\nThis is a classic long squeeze, sudden drop in the price (probably caused intentionally by institutional investors in order to buy more at lower prices) forced traders to close their positions (got liquidated) which creates FUD and make more traders to cash out to USDT (or any other stablecoin).\n\n**Why I believe today was a bullish sign?** \n\nThe market recovered really fast and we can see how there is a strong support level at $47,000 - $48000.\n\nAlso, Coinbase whales are driving the market ,we can see from the following chart how they reacted when the price on Coinbase hit today's lows.\n\n[Binance vs Coinbase price \\(BTC\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gn3t2yxwv2j61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1565c05ca553ffd8657bd78c7d89f081bdbdf404)\n\n# Key Takeaways from today\n\n\\- Futures affect the price of the market more then in the past due to their popularity.\n\n\\- If you're a HOLDer, stop panic, avoid those dips, you're here for the long term, those dips are just a bumps in the road. \n\n\\- If you consider yourself a trader, stop loss orders are your best friend, they will protect your portfolio.\n\n\\- Be carful if you trading futures, high leverage can be tempting but also can be the death of your portfolio and cause you big losses, trade without leverage until you're really confident in your trading skills and keep the leverage low.\n\n\\- Institutional investors become a thing in the crypto world, watch out for future price manipulations.\n\n\\- Corrections are good and healthy during a big bull run.\n\nAnd most importantly - BTC is strong, Crypto is strong this is just the beginning! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR a long squeeze caused the dip but BTC reacted strong and fast.**",
