It would save a good amount of people a lot of legal trouble and heartache. I know I&#39;ve been accumulating and it would be heartbeaking after years of painstakingly putting away fiat to consistently DCA, then when you&#39;re finally about to reap the benefits, to be stopped by accusations of money laundering or illegal activity. It&#39;s absolutely unacceptable and we have to avoid for as many people as we can. Not to mention these same banks participate in money laundering, however, they just get a slap on the wrist. Let&#39;s make this list guys and have it stickied somrwhere in this subreddit so we can help the community avoid the corrupt financial institutions. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
