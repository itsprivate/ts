Quick story short, he told me he over invested himself into Crypto (what a noob) over the past few weeks (as if I don&#39;t know what&#39;s DCA is...). Poor lad run out of money and was wondering if I can loan him some cash for him to go over this month. Lol! If he only new that&#39;s I&#39;m quite a lurker in this sub and I was lucky to make some great gains on SOL, ONE and Algorand based on some shillers past recommendations in this subreddit. I immediately took off some profits and offered him some money and told him to reimbursement me whenever his portfolio made it to the green. Secretly, I&#39;m very proud and grateful that my kiddo is into Crypto for a better future and did congratulate him! </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll call him next week and tell him to subscribe to this sub and start reading some advices and maybe try to get some moons.</p>\n\n<p>Tldr: don&#39;t invest more than you can afford too son, from mum ‚ù§</p>\n\n<p>Edit: love your responses guys and some very funny. Much love. Can&#39;t reply to all of you as I&#39;m having a tea party with the other mums in the areas ü´ñ</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
