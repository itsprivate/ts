A few weeks back I met this girl at a supermarket after I heard her on the phone talking about Crypto.\n\nWhen she hung up, I said \"doing good with crypto?\".   She replied with enthusiasm, and we talked a bit about it.   We talked for over 10 minutes In the produce section. We ended it, and went our separate ways.  Anyway, ran into her again the same night, this time at a local bar.  We ended up getting sloshed that night, and I took her home.  Now couple weeks in we can't get enough of each other.\n\nFeels great, and I have a feeling it's gonna last, we've been spending everyday since with each other.    She's already talking about the future and booked tickets to a show 6 months in advance.    I don't know but nobody is gonna book that far ahead unless they plan on keeping you around.  But unlike the last always complaining about crypto, this one is right next to me on her laptop at night looking at charts with me sharing tips we pick up.     \n\nToday I woke up next to her, I made her breakfast and the first thing she said to me was \"*that shitcoin we got last night is already up 20%*\".   \n\nDidn't say good morning, didn't say thank you for the breakfast ...just starting talking about shitcoins as she wolfed down the egg and cheese sandwich I made.    \n\nI love it. Perfect match for me. best of all she isn't a clean freak. She takes care of herself, makes great money, has two masters degrees, and works out but doesn't care so much about things being super organized. \n\nA smart pretty woman who's a cryptard like me and doesn't give a shit about the little things.  I swear I stepped into some sort of fantasy portal.     If this is a dream , I don't want to wake up. Ever.",
