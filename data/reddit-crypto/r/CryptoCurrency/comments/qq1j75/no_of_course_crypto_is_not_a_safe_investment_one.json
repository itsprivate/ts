These are the last words you want to hear at the moment - it&#39;s the equivalent of a game over screen!</p>\n\n<p>To make real money in this world requires risk. Where there is no risk there is no money.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t to encourage people to FOMO into crypto when they can&#39;t afford to - but to understand that to be successful with crypto you have to accept the danger and embrace it. It&#39;s not safe, it&#39;s bloody dangerous  - even with a good plan in place.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s the attraction!</p>\n\n<p>So stop trying to rationalise it or give yourself a false sense of security. Investing in crypto is terrifying, and you need to accept that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
