When I told him that’s not a form of payment, he proceeded to point out the “Visa logo” which was the logo of the library the card was for.  </p>\n\n<p>After politely asking for a different form of payment he finally pulled out a real Visa card while mumbling, “The only reason I’m not taking my business elsewhere is because this record is underpriced, I can sell it for 10x as much!” </p>\n\n<p>On his way out he stumbled into the door and yelled, “I want my 4% cash back, Stellar to the mooooon!” </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully all of you crypto people aren’t this obnoxious, have a good day!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
