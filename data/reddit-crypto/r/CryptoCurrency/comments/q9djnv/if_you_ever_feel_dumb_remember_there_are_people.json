But bullish is way more fun.</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you a secret: This is not what a bear market looks like. Don&#39;t be like: &quot;Oh this dump to 60k is what I&#39;ve been warning you about. <strong>We&#39;re in a bull market, if you&#39;re still a bear, just join the bulls, we don&#39;t bite.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
