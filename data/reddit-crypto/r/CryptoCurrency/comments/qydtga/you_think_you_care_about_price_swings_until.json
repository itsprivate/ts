After coming home I looked at my portfolio, mostly out of habit, and saw the price tumble. I didn&#39;t care. On Thursday my portfolio went down even more. I still didn&#39;t care. I would give all of my crypto away in an instant to get my friend back.\nPerspective is a powerful thing. I spent a substantial sum of money on medical care for my dog in the last months and didn&#39;t even blink an eye. I am in a privileged position and don&#39;t struggle with food security, housing or health care and I understood that, in the end of the day, everything else is just extra.\nDon&#39;t let a number on a screen occupy your mind for longer than a second! It is not worth it. In the end of the day it is not important, even if it sometimes feels like the most important thing at the moment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
