Let&#39;s take a look at the best and worst performing coins in this timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The 10 <strong>best</strong> performing coins/tokens (excluding stablecoins, compound tokens) are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>LEO: -26%</li>\n<li>CEL: -31%</li>\n<li>ALGO: -50% (the sub is gonna love this one hahaha)</li>\n<li>SOL: -50%</li>\n<li>ADA: -50%</li>\n<li>BTC/WBTC: -51%</li>\n<li>BNB: -54%</li>\n<li>COMP: -55%</li>\n<li>ETH: -56%</li>\n<li>CRO: -58%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Aside from a few outliers, these are serious projects that are highly regarded in this sub.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The 10 <strong>worst</strong> performing coins/tokens are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ICP: -95%</li>\n<li>SHIB: -82%</li>\n<li>AVAX: -81%</li>\n<li>FIL: -80%</li>\n<li>KLAY: -79%</li>\n<li>VET: -75%</li>\n<li>OKB: -75%</li>\n<li>DOGE: -74%</li>\n<li>EOS*: -74%</li>\n<li>BSV: -74%</li>\n<li>(SAFEMOON: -74%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a bit of a mixed basket. There are definitely some meme coins., as well as some pumps that were obvious PnD vehicles during the bull run. There are also some serious projects in this list, too (poor VeChain).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In an effort to keep this as objective as possible, I&#39;m not going to analyze these results or attempt to draw any conclusions from them. I just wanted to throw some facts in the ring with all the FUD-fueled articles that seem to dominate the front page.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
