Check it out to see how many moons you&#39;ll be getting next Wednesday at the end of Moon Week.  </p>\n\n<p>This Moon Week sticky will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Wednesday to give exposure to our governance polls for this month.

Please keep all discussions about the polls and ideas, not the author.  </p>\n\n<p>Please note that all governance polls need to be posted as a pre-proposal in <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta\">r/CryptoCurrencyMeta</a> for community feedback and mod approval.  You can do this at any time during the month and if you wait until just before the next moon week it is unlikely we will be able to approve it in time.  </p>\n\n<p>For more information about moons, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki\">see our wiki page here</a>.  It is an ongoing effort to document what Moons are and how they work.  If there is anything that isn&#39;t included or sufficiently clear, please ask so we can answer you and improve the wiki page</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
