The catalyst for this is the bitcoin halving (block reward getting cut in half) every four years. When Bitcoin halves the market usually go crazy and a bull run starts. This starts with BTC rising then ETH, then BTC falls, ETH goes up/sideways and alts go crazy. Then in the multi-year bear market the alts get destroyed and BTC regains its dominance. Here is a countdown for the next halving:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When everyone is a noob and in their first cycle usually it&amp;#39;s already too late. Most people heard about the hype wave in the middle of the bull run or close to the top and buy a lot of shitcoins at the top thinking they will be the next greatest thing ever. Then the whole thing crashes and people sell at a loss. Thing is as long as you aren&amp;#39;t too deep in shitcoins if you just held onto your ETH/BTC it will go up eventually. Buying in the last cycle&amp;#39;s top would be amazing now, and that&amp;#39;s what people in 2025 will be saying about today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second cycle, you are smarter, aren&amp;#39;t as diversified into shitcoins, and hopefully accumulated during down trends. Now HODL and congrats. You did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
