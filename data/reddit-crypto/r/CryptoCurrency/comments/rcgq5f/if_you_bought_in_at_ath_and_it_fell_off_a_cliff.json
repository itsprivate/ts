I used to check them constantly trying to find the &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot; (I didn&amp;#39;t really understand what that was at the time) in the middle of a bull run... it was even more after it had a major, prolonged (actual) dip. I was off the ATH by less than 5% on the buy in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling like a fool for learning FOMO the hard way. I also made the mistake of telling 2 people I got into Crypto, and was up. I was green for less than a week and was constantly asked &amp;#39;how much was I up now?&amp;#39; In the following red months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those months did end though. I kept buying, lowering my average purchase price. Even with recent &amp;#39;crashes&amp;#39; (I use that term loosely) I&amp;#39;m still green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now not every coin does this, but some do. DYOR to find out which ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: This ofcourse excludes shitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
