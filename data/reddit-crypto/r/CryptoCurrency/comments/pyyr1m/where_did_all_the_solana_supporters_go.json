Also how fast this subreddits sentiment changes one moment you are getting downvoted about trying to point out the problems with Solana then the next you are being upvoted. Just goes to show most people have no idea what they are doing and will just bandwagon with the current popular sentiment. </p>\n\n<p>Also how far people on this subreddit will go to protect their precious coins that can never be criticised. I had multiple Solana lovers follow my comments downvoting them or replying to the comments with me stating the fact that Solana has gone down in the past before and it’s only a matter of time again. Even after the recent outage it had they would follow me saying I was spreading misinformation about it going down in the past even though I was citing sources from Solana themselves. But at that point the subreddit sentiment had begun to change and they were being downvoted now and their precious egos couldn’t handle it and they deleted all their comments. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of people on this subreddit treat their investments like sports teams and they cannot handle any criticisms to their coins. Hence why you shouldn’t listen to what is trending here, any criticism will be downvoted and only the positives will be upvoted. Always do your own research.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
