It&amp;#39;s even worse when people just give up on Crypto as a whole just because they didn&amp;#39;t make a profit after being in it in a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What people forget is, Crypto IS A LONG TERM asset. The harsh truth is, Crypto does not guarantee you a green portfolio every day of the week. However, the magic of the Crypto market is that it can completely erase weeks of losses in a matter of days like we&amp;#39;ve seen after every dip this year. This is why experienced Crypto investors almost never sell and instead accumulate more during any dips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: You won&amp;#39;t make a profit every single day. However, in the long term, the profits are always going to outperform any short term losses. The longer you stay in Crypto, the richer you&amp;#39;ll get. Always have patience!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
