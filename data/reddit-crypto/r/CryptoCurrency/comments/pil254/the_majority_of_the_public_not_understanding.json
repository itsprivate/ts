The general public can be pretty ignorant of the finer points of financial affairs, and a lot of them don&#39;t even understand the history and functionality of the money they use everyday.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They don&#39;t know about the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nixon-shock.asp\">Nixon Shock</a> or what that implies about USD.</li>\n<li>They don&#39;t know how the <a href=\"https://www.somagnews.com/9-trillion-story-22-of-us-dollars-printed-in-2020/\">federal reserve printed roughly 22%</a> of the money in circulation in 2020, or how <a href=\"https://techstartups.com/2021/05/22/40-us-dollars-existence-printed-last-12-months-america-repeating-mistake-1921-weimar-germany/\">it ramped up even more to 40% of money in circulation</a> in a little over the past year.</li>\n<li>They don&#39;t understand the kind of influence over daily events the banking systems holds by being so centralized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <strong>real</strong> indicator, in my opinion, that we&#39;re still early is the lack of adoption of cryptocurrency in the modern world. Even after this process has been more or less completed (however long that will take), most people probably still won&#39;t grasp how the new system they&#39;re using works on too deep of a level.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
