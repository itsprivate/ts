Having herd of bitcoin in 2012, and seeing it still be relevant, and  at 2500$,i figured i needed to look into it. \n\nso after a week of starting to dive down the rabbit hole, i did the logical thing. i quite my job, lived out of my car, and spent the next 3 months glued to the computer. i had to learn finances, economics , computer science (i built a computer and actually learned linux as well as ran a bitcoin node) as well as a lot more. all the while bitcoin is running to 20k, and everything and everyone is going crazy. it was an insane time,  and ill never forget that feeling. \n\ni didnt buy that much before it went parabolic, and my highest i bought some bitcoin was at 9500$. fast forward a month, and the beginning of the bear market starts. but im actually in it for the tech. i really believe its the only way for a peaceful revolution. i had taken some profits (again small  amounts) so i never sold and watched my alts and bitcoin go down 50-90%\n\nbut every week i would dca in. every chance i got some extra cash i bought some alts. after a couple months of living out of my car i had saved up a bunch of money so i moved into an apartment. got a better job with my new self taught tech and finance skills so i had more money i could afford to throw into crypto. not a lot, but an extra 10$ here and 20$ there. \n\nbear market was rough. lotta days i thought i fucked up and i might be wrong. but i really believed in this stuff, and i never stopped learning about it. i listened to Ivan and lark as well as many others everyday, and i gotta be honest that really helped from a mental perspective. \n\n\nanyways 2021 comes around and things area great. havent sold anything, cause i believe in the tech, and wanna hodle untill i can just spend my crypto and dont need to sell it for trash fiat. \n\n\nbut today i had the opportunity to buy some land. not a lot, but its land. so i had to sell some of my crypto for it. not gonna lie after i hit the sell button i almost got sick. i dont want to sell, but ive wanted a small piece of earth as my own all my life. and if it wasnt for crypto i wouldnt have this chance. \n\nnow while i did sell a couple different crypto assets, i immediately used the funds to buy  eth, and did a cdp to get dai to sell for cash to pay for the land. my  liquidation price is extremely low so even in a bear market im safe. and this way i wont miss out completely on the insane bull later this year.  i just gotta rely on eth to hopefully make up for the potential gains of cryptos i sold. \n\nanyways i just wanted to tell this story cause i know there are lots of yall who are new to this, and while im not a smart man, i wanna share the biggest tips that have helped me here. \n\n you can get rich in a week, or lose everything in a second. only play with money you can lose. in fact consider it lost until you sell and receive your good/product/service or trash fiat. dca and time in the markets beats trying to time the markets. \n\nmake a plan with contingencies, and stick to it. \n\nday trade works for 10% of people, and unless your willing to spend alot of time to learn, dont dabble with more then 50$-100$ trades. same for leverage. \n\ndiversify, have a couple major plays and 10% of your bag should be moon shots. \n\nfind good quality sources of information and vet them. so much trash crypto tubers and  podcasts. but theres amazing sources for practical and solid knowledge. just really do research and vet whoever your listening to \n\nand most important learn. i listen to an hour or two of crypto related content every day. practical knowledge and skills are something that doesnt go up or down, it only increase your value. \n\ndont let crypto be your life. have passions and hobbies so on the  red days you can put down the screen and do something fun or productive to  distract you. \n\nand finally, no one ever went broke taking profits pulling out a little here and there is never bad. but never sell everything , always keep a small moonshot bag. and have a hodl bag of quality projects  and stick to holding them for at least 4 years. \n\n\n\nanyways i hope this helps someone out.i know most of the is just the usual tropes and sayings. but ive found great wisdom and power behind these mantras .  i hate to sell some of my assets ive held for s long, and it really hurt. but im still in crypto, and i will never fully leave, cause im in it for the techðŸ˜¸ and the peaceful revolution it brings. good luck yâ€™all!!!",
