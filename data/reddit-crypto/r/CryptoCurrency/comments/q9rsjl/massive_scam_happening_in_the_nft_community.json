  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just got sent a discord channel invite from someone. It was an invite to Cool Cats NFT channel. They’re a highly profitable and respected project and the message said they were doing a massive giveaway. I decided to check it out. Pop in and I’m sent to their verify channel which is usually pretty normal. Shows they have 95,000 members and all that. They require you to !join command to verify and you get sent a message by the bot Collab.Land to connect your MetaMask to verify. A little weird to verify using your wallet just to join a channel, but whatever. Thought maybe that’s just how they do it? So I type in my password to unlock my wallet and then it asks for my seed phrase.. I was on my iPad so I thought maybe I hadn’t logged onto/set up my metamask on here yet so I was looking for my seed phrase. I got distracted looking for it for awhile and came back a lil later and tried again when I started thinking this is kinda odd… I’ve used Collab.Land quite a few times but this was my first DM to the bot… odd. Searched my DMs for “collab” … BOOM .. two identical bots come back. One with all my previous messages and that new one.. I’m like wowwwwwww. Go back to the “Cool Cats” discord welcome channel and there are soOoOo many people joining and I’m like this is so bad!! I typed “THIS IS A SCAM!” And hit enter. My message was immediately deleted and the server was deleted from my server list. </p>\n\n<p>Someone or some people created a completely identical Collab.Land bot, very legit looking Discord channel with 95,000 members!? , and an extremely legit MetaMask modal that I’m assuming is harvesting everyone’s seed phrases and wallet login passwords. Haven’t seen a post about it yet. Spread the word. This one is elaborate. Help others to not get scammed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
