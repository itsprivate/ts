I go in and finish everything as soon as I can and then start looking at those charts. I look at them and I pray to them, ask the crypto gods not to make my portfolio bleed like there is no tomorrow. Count the gains I would have made if I sold some during the ATHs. Go to the washroom and cry my eyes out. Then back I go and stare at the charts. I lose track of time every day and end up leaving a lot later than the others. </p>\n\n<p>I get in some ways the crypto gods have listened to me, they did nothing to my cryptos but helped me with my fiat. </p>\n\n<p>I have to go now, it&#39;s time I use the washroom stall and cry my eyes out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
