A logarithmic scale of the price of Bitcoin, showing the halving events.</a></p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the price of Bitcoin peaked at the end of the year (mid-December) around $19k. This was following a massive, lightning-fast bullrun that is now the stuff of legend around here. The FOMO of that year has made many of us crypto enthusiasts who we are, quite honestly.</p>\n\n<p>Here is that peak highlighted on the Rainbow chart:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uhjavwn2nft71.png?width=1826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c7aa1e9e61e1ae8ef45ccc61e72231a9c81069a\">Bitcoin&#39;s peak in December 2017. Not quite halfway between halvings.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s back up a little. Where was Bitcoin in, say, mid-October of 2017?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ek1mkudbnft71.png?width=1823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f129b3f918c9843c52efd174e30b8669055e9cf4\">The price of Bitcoin on October 12, 2017 was $5,600.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This means that from mid-October to mid-December of 2017, Bitcoin skyrocketed from $5,600 to over $19,000. That&#39;s a growth of 343% in 2 months. That&#39;s a fucking rocket if I&#39;ve ever seen one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let&#39;s extrapolate.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring for a moment the sheer amount of money that would be required to be injected into Bitcoin in order to move the price this much, let&#39;s just speculate for a second.</p>\n\n<p>If Bitcoin followed the same trajectory from now until mid-December that it did during the same period in 2017, it will be...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w3g91dcznft71.png?width=1823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe536faf49a4156c0532d91adfbaa22a6a746e2c\">One hundred and eighty one god damn thousand dollars.</a></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s right. Let that sink in.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t even need the comforting colors of the rainbow to tell you this. Bitcoin&#39;s price today ($57,600) plus a growth of 343%, is even higher than that estimate, at <strong>$197,500.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason this has become eerily predictable is because of the halvings. If you don&#39;t know what a Bitcoin halving event is, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/\">you can read more about it here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, of course, this means a tripled marketcap as well. Can the marketcap for Bitcoin really reach $3 trillion? Depends on who you ask. Myself and many others believe that is likely still small peanuts when we&#39;re talking about a global digital currency being adopted in increasing measure around the world. We&#39;re still pretty early.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the hopium, and may blessings be upon us all in Q4 2021. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>Edit: for one more dose of hopium, check out the <a href=\"https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/\">Stock-to-Flow model.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
