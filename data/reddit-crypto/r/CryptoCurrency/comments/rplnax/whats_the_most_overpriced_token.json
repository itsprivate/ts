What&amp;#39;s the deal about the so-called meme-coins, or those tokens which don&amp;#39;t seem to have any interesting peculiarity in general?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that fads are a thing, and that if enough people buy (literally) into it, a coin value gets to sustain itself... but why should investors risk money on something useless?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there one coin whose value you can&amp;#39;t make sense of?
