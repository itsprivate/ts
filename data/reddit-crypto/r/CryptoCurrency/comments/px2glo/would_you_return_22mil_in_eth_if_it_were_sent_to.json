It is morally right. $20mil makes you a target (that&#39;s easily identifiable on the blockchain or if you ever communicated with an address on an exchange that does KYC).</p>\n\n<p>Reasons for not returning: if I misspell the address or don&#39;t check the gas fee cost, it&#39;s on me and I should bite the bullet.
