It&#39;s been tested by around 2000 people already with various degrees of profitability - based on the user&#39;s config.</p>\n\n<p>I am now working on creating a web app for it so that&#39;s more user friendly than running scrips. Many of you were really interested in the app so I&#39;m happy that some of you have joined in the development of this project!</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested to be updated on the project&#39;s development and to be part of our beta testing release, you can join the subreddit that I just created for it. Bear in mind it&#39;s all bearbones right now, but I will post more regular updates on this particular project on there :)</p>\n\n<p>We chose the name after the Norse God of Knowledge - the badass Mimir.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MimirTrading\">https://np.reddit.com/r/MimirTrading</a></p>\n\n<p>Or if you want to register your interest for beta testing, just go here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mimirbot.com/\">https://mimirbot.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if you&#39;re good with code and would like to try out the alpha version check out the github repo:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot\">https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
