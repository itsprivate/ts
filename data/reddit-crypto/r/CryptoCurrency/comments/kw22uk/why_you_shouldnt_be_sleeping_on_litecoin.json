I've also noticed several people trashing Litecoin and asking why people hold it, so here's my answer.\n\n**Inflation & store of value** \\- I think we can all agree this bull run is fueled by inflation in fiat currencies, at levels never seen before. Well Litecoin also has limitted supply just like BTC. I see LTC as silver 2.0 while Bitcoin is gold 2.0\n\n**PayPal -** When PayPal enabled it's US customers to buy crypto, LTC shot right up. Why? Litecoin is the most appealing coin to most people. It's very similiar to Bitcoin and it has a relatively low price. Q1 of this year, PayPal will enable ALL it's 345M customers worldwide to buy crypto, this should benefit LTC the most out of all the crypto choices PayPal offers.\n\n**MimbleWimble Network Upgrade** \\- MWEB will enable opt-in privacy features for Litecoin, and it's just around the corner. A lot of people expect privacy to be the next hype/trend in crypto. Together with privacy, MWEB also offers scaling solutions.\n\n**Cardano Velvet Fork -** A Velvet Fork / [Nipopow](https://nipopows.com/) will enable smart contract compatability to Litecoin.
