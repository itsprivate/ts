Most of the top projects are already down 50% to 70% from their ATHs. Yet those people who you envy for getting in early have all dealt with this before. They absolutely dealt with the FUD, with the bleak outlook and crypto having &quot;no future&quot;, with the pressure to sell (even at a loss), with the seemingly mounting opportunity cost, and they still decided to hodl for better days. That is a VERY difficult thing to do. If you had gotten in earlier, would you have been able to hodl?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the opportunity for everyone who joined us in the last six months to test their conviction, get some battle scars, add to their bags (wisely) and hopefully come out better on the other side. Will the last bull be the last bull? Probably not. So the only thing that could prevent you from becoming that envied vet next time around is quitting now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
