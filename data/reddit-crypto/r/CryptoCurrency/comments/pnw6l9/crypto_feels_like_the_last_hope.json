The cost of living is becoming insane or rather is insane. Even with a well paying job I find myself living check to check and in credit card debt. I invest what I can into crypto while trying to manage my debt the best I can. A 9-5 is never going to allow me to become &quot;well off&quot;.  I have maybe earned a few nickles from a savings account thanks to the amazing 0.01% interests rates our banks give. I&#39;ve earned more staking coins this year than the last 28 years of my life in a savings account. My 401k gets about 10% a year but this is nowhere enough to retire with the insane increase of living costs. I hope we can all break free from the corruption the system. Crypto is here to stay and it will save us all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
