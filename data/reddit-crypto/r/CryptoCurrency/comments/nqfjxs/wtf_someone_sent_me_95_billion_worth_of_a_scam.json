Through a little research, I discovered that there's a [real token called Fear NFT that is worth ~$0.85 CAD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fear-nfts/). But that token has a max supply of 65 million, so obviously what I have is a copycat scam token designed to trick people into purchasing it. It even tricked Koinly into thinking it was the real Fear token since it's pulling the price instead of showing as $0 like some other tokens I have.\n\n[Poocoin shows the real price of the fake Fear token](https://poocoin.app/tokens/0xf8fef1b94996de437a3f7aff7ac915a46563c04f), which is much, much lower. But even at that price, the tokens in my wallet are worth ~$1,500 which would be nice, except [people have reported that it's not possible to sell the token at all](https://bscscan.com/token/0xf8fef1b94996de437a3f7aff7ac915a46563c04f#comments) so it's essentially worthless.\n\nMy question is, what the fuck do I do now? I have no idea why this scam token was sent to my wallet. How am I supposed to record this transaction? My whole portfolio balance is messed up too now, how can I dispose of these tokens without incurring a $9 billion loss and immediately triggering a CRA investigation?\n\nEdit: u/brocoliassassin sent me some links about ERC-20 tokens with contract vulnerabilities. BEP-20 is basically a clone of ERC 20 so that may or may not be what is happening here but we thought it might benefit people to be aware of possible exploits.\n\nhttps://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/555-erc20-token-vulnerability\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/erc-20-ethereum-tokens-fake-deposit",
