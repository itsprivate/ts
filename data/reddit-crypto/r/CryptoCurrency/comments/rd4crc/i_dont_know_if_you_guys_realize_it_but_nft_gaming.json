FPS are more my style, and SidusHeroes looks exciting and I think it might set a new standard for FPS-style NFT games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now with NFTs in games changes the whole system. Imagine playing a game that&amp;#39;s built with NFTs. You can earn tokens throughout the game missions and challenges. You can buy and sell items using those tokens. And you can convert those tokens to fiat. On top of that if you hold the tokens, their value would go up as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NFTs will change the future of gaming. The tech is fairly new so it&amp;#39;ll take some time to become mainstream. But when it does, it&amp;#39;ll do wonders in the gaming community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are into gaming and also see the potential, There are several NFT gaming metaverses that I think are promising. FPS are more my style, and &lt;a href=\"https://SidusHeroes.com\"&gt;SidusHeroes.com&lt;/a&gt; looks exciting and I think it might set a new standard for FPS-style NFT games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
