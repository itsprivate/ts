This will be fun. I purposely waited a little while so it didn&#39;t get played out and old. I know I&#39;m rambling on but I got a character limit to meet. Usually these blow up quite a bit so if you&#39;re early to the roast and post some zingers you might be able to rack up a few hundred or thousand moons. \nHope everyone is pumped for the distribution tommorow\n This is a good chance for you to rack up some new moons for the next distribution\nIf you haven&#39;t voted yet in the governance polls go ahead and do that please you will get extra moons and you help support our awesome community!</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nThis is just for fun and to allow people to have some perspective it can kind of be an echo chamber in here otherwise</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
