Yes, it could keep going up and you&#39;d miss out on those gains, but it could also go down and you&#39;d lose everything. </p>\n\n<p>Once you&#39;ve taken back your initial investment though, you are playing with free money. You&#39;d be surprised just how relaxing it is to check the charts on a &quot;free money&quot; crypto and not really care if the latest candle is red or green.</p>\n\n<p>A good strategy is to continue doing the same thing every time that coin doubles. Take out half, leave the other half invested. Rinse and repeat. It&#39;s a super easy way to always know when you should be taking profits along the way, and also a way to always have dry powder to buy into any available price dips.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
