Is it being brigaded? Or do people think it&amp;#39;s tagged as comedy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why the heck would we need a brand new coin to buy porn? If I wanted anonymity then surely i&amp;#39;d use one of the already existing, perfectly functioning, time-tested privacy coins like XMR, DASH or ZCASH? Why would I want to take the extra steps of going to some dodgy exchange to buy a coin that I can solely use for one thing? It literally makes zero sense&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, every single of those coins OP listed is an ERC-20 token. I don&amp;#39;t know how many of you are familiar with ethereum gas prices (i&amp;#39;m guessing the majority are) but I don&amp;#39;t really feel like paying hundreds of dollars in gas fees just to see Tyrone bang somebody&amp;#39;s wife. I make transactions with XMR all the time and end up paying a few cents&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless i&amp;#39;m missing something here then it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that porn coins will NOT be the next big thing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
