Market crashes, we panic sell all the cards, they are basically worthless at the time because everyone is dumping their cards, and 2 years of transferring the credit card balance around to other cards with no APR promotions so we don't drown in interest.\n\nIf we would have stuck it out, kept mining, and HODL the amount we would have made makes me sick to my stomach. The moral of this story is you don't loose money till you give up all your assets. Whether that is mining rigs, or crypto you bought, just hold on tight because things will recover.

This go around I've been mining with 4 cards and dumping $20 - $50 a month into shitcoins to see if they go anywhere. While I'm sad to see my portfolio get cut down, it's only money I was already willing to loose.\n\nTL;DR: Stay chill and be smart.",
