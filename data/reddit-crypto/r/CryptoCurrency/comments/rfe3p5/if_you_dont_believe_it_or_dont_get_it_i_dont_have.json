The founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, saw before everyone else what Bitcoin was capable of. In those early days, however, not many could imagine the potential of this new currency. Today, his invention has completely changed the world and it’s safe to assume that those early doubters should have done more research.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Found this quote from internet. Thought it represents well that mentality which we all need to have. Time is most valuable asset. Don&amp;#39;t waste your time trying to get people in cryptocurrency. If they are interested of course help them. But do not waste time on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto is &lt;strong&gt;inevitable.&lt;/strong&gt; It will bring huge changes to society and financial systems. Maybe it will take year or decade. But it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for awards everyone. Appreciate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
