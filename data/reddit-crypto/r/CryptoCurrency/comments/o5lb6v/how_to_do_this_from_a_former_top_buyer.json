I thought I&#39;d try to share my experience as a former bag holder and how I wound up successful. I bought near the top in 2017. BTC was boring and &quot;expensive&quot; so I had a mix of shitcoins in my portfolio (I&#39;ll not throw shade on anyone in particular to protect my inbox). For a time, I was a genius. Then all of a sudden I wasn&#39;t. Eventually, I found myself down 50% and had to make some tough decisions. Here&#39;s what I did and how it turned out.</p>\n\n<p>I first had to decide if I was a long-term bull or bear on crypto. Obviously, I&#39;m still here because I think crypto is the future. I also looked at the cyclical price history and surmised that - although it might be a while - crypto would blow by the previous highs. Rather than try to time the market, I decided to DCA.</p>\n\n<p>Three important things about that DCA.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It was a monthly buy that I could afford as part of my household budget.</li>\n<li>I decided to focus on BTC and ETH (I did continue to buy LTC for a while since it was on Coinbase).</li>\n<li>I concerned myself with other things in order to forget (or not focus on) the DCA. It simply did its thing no matter the price.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Looking back at my buy history, I picked up some ETH near $80. The magic of DCA is that <em>most</em> of my crypto was purchased at those low prices. Importantly, I never knew where the market was going in the short term (still don&#39;t), but through my own research, I developed a bull thesis for crypto long term.</p>\n\n<p>Now I use the <a href=\"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/\">rainbow chart</a> to guide my DCA. In short, I pause it in the orange and start back up in the green (just started it back up with my June purchase yesterday). I had started this before finding the rainbow chart. When your monthly buy is a tiny fraction of your total holdings, it will feel like a waste. The chart formalizes this intuition into a plan, but it&#39;s still DCA.</p>\n\n<p>I know the exact feelings many on this board are experiencing. I can empathize. <strong>IF</strong> after careful consideration, you decide you are a long-term bull like myself, I hope you&#39;ll consider the strategy above. It&#39;s boring. It&#39;s not guaranteed to work. It has worked well for me so far.</p>\n\n<p>This run may or may not be over, but I&#39;m excited to see where we are ~1.5 years after the next BTC halving. Good luck to everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
