They said it should take 1 to 3 days (lol, why? but okay.). I also paid $35 fees for this slow process.\n\n3 days later, someone from my bank called and said intermediatery bank couldn't find the bank account and they need me to send a handwritten signed document telling them where to send money. They said it is okay if I take a photo of the paper and send them.  \n\n\nI wrote one and sent. They called back and said it is too long. I only need to write bank name and account. I wrote another one and sent.  \n\n\n5 more days passed. I called the bank like 10 times and they answered only 1 time. They said they are looking into it but it can take up to 1 month as it takes time to manually review.  \n\n\n10 days from initial Swift, they returned money. But, not only they kept original 35 dollars fees but also cut another 15 dollars. So total $50 in fees. They didn't do the work I paid them to do and kept my money for 10 days.   \n\n\nSo how are they supposed to be the future? In what world they can charge for something that they don't provide? How can they hold my money 10 days?   \n\n\nI am sure all of us can relate to this. Future is bright for De-Fi. F\\*ck banks.",
