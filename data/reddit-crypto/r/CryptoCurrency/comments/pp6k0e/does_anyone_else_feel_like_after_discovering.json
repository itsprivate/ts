My family thinks I&#39;m a fool. I have ONE friend I trust telling at least I am in it.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of my friends are this subreddit. We&#39;re over here dreaming about Lambos and talking about those gains. This is the best community and the only community, it&#39;s like a secret club where you actually know how to make money. There&#39;s all these get rich quick schemes, and even though crypto isn&#39;t that, it&#39;s a promising place that helps people become financially free. </p>\n\n<p>I feel really bad for people who fall for scams. Just invest in Crypto. I want to help but I don&#39;t think I am the one for the job. I enjoy it here and feeling like you are part of the Crypto community is very rewarding in of itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
