I remember that sometime ago, there was a poll that asked how much crypto do you have, but it was in terms of USD, and majority were below USD 1,000 as far as I can recall. I&#39;m taking this in a different take, to measure it based on a more personal perspective without disclosing much.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of it for a while, and figured that the best indicator could be based on your monthly salary. This way, it&#39;s easier to see where you are at considering that the <del>average</del> median yearly income in the world is at USD 9,000+, and there&#39;s a significant amount of disparity to it. Therefore, someone&#39;s USD 1,000 could be very much different from the other person.</p>\n\n<p>The key here is to better know the profiles of some sub-redditors in here, and probably to just keep the conversation going to know about the common benchmarks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, in comparison to your monthly salary, what is the value of your crypto portfolio?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>For the record, I cannot see who voted for what- therefore, your identity/information would not be compromised. Only you can view your answer.</em></p>\n\n<p>Note: Check the results by VOTES, not my Moons, please.
