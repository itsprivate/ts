Did the coins everyone here picked hold up? Did they explode with Bitcoin's huge rise? Let's find out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://i.imgur.com/IDVJwil.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IDVJwil.jpg) \\- December 5th Update \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/TwNZh1U.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TwNZh1U.jpg) \\- January 5th Update\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/edit?usp=sharing) \\- Updated Spreadsheet\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs usual, let's start with the worst performer of the month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#10: XRP**\n\n[What a fall from grace.](https://preview.redd.it/uk5i2ffiqh961.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=b39286cfbeeaea09c219560cc16ea66715134ad9)\n\nAs I'm sure many of you have been watching, the implosion of XRP has been nothing short of spectacular. What was worth almost triple the last month's price is now down *below the original investment.* And this is WITH Bitcoin almost doubling in price! It's been a sad fall for the former #3 coin on the ladder, being replaced with everyone's good friend Tether. Womp womp. We'll have to see if the coming months have any better news for XRP fans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#9 - XMR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A steady, but ultimately boring grind.](https://preview.redd.it/0dpvcox5rh961.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c5bfb6ac9235663608f576870342f0d185eb5e)\n\nKeeping with the pace of last month, Monero continues to underperform the market and only rise slightly. Despite Bitcoin launching into the stratosphere, Monero has been hit with some delistings and uncertainty towards its future on several exchanges. It began to rise with the pack but was slapped down with the bad news. The total XMR value only rose $2 in a month, not the most stellar performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#8 - SOL**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hills and Valleys.](https://preview.redd.it/w6vyugwwrh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=368293571b6a3202e4be5d4fc2e9fd8771f3ffa0)\n\nSOL actually had me worried for a while, with a shattering drop all the way down to $1.17, which marked a very long time low for the coin. However, it has since rallied and almost doubled its price since then, coming in with modest profits instead of large losses. Definitely an interesting price watch for the month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#7 - IOTA**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The price appears to be a little... tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/4117j1bfsh961.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=343eaa9da3055e3d3ea59c842e58c80fe7a2500c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother barely-mover for the month, IOTA got us a whopping $5. It seems the price action is somewhat erratic and not necessarily tied to Bitcoin whatsoever, falling on days where Bitcoin does well, and doing well when Bitcoin has off days. Still, it stayed in the same range for most of the month, not really doing anything special or anything dire either. If this was a blue chip stock, you'd probably still love its monthly returns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#6 - NANO**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Doing a bit of mountain climbing.](https://preview.redd.it/hmrc5qn2th961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71ad29f1cbf14b7187bc1347141e24b75975965)\n\nNano came out of nowhere with a mediocre monthly performance, sitting around the dollar range, when suddenly a giant spike of volume propelled the coin as high as +70% of its monthly levels. Since then, it has been largely falling back to earth, but still retains quite a bit of its gains, pushing it firmly over the 100% profit margin. Will Nano continue to show strength as both Bitcoin and Ethereum congest and have wild fee increases, or was this one of many fakeouts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#5 - ADA**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A coin on a mission.](https://preview.redd.it/lkmgi0epth961.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5440df0139733e69ed12d28dffd1e0b343c0187)\n\nADA had a largely mediocre performance most of December, but picked it up as Bitcoin went meteoric, following it to new heights. Excitement of the project getting somewhat close to completion and new buyers entering the market looking at the top 10 had ADA popping off during the last couple of weeks. Can it keep this momentum going into the new year?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#4 - VET**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A slight fall into a meteoric rise.](https://preview.redd.it/5d2kbyubuh961.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=eacf45d195c5a3fc37f665f9547a22fc22ae2cf8)\n\nVET started off the month strong but lulled a bit as BTC went wild over the Christmas holidays. However, like ADA, it has since shot up incredibly fast and has continued to hold a lot of its gains. Both ADA and VET are inching closer to their 2017-2018 all time highs, nowhere close to the top but unlike a lot of Coins from that era are showing remarkable strength going into the new year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#3 - ETH**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Money printer go BRRRR.](https://preview.redd.it/daflae14vh961.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1e3e936817f23469245532ed1e8d0b271117e1)\n\nETH's chart is basically what you want to see in any Coin this month, it's basically a straight trend upwards. ETH's momentum this month has been largely unstoppable with ETH2 news coming out and the large DEFI following - It looks positioned to do very well and uphold the big responsibility of being the #2 coin. With news of stablecoins being vetted by the US Government, it may perform even better in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#2 - LTO**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Disgusting growth.](https://preview.redd.it/nyiecvbnvh961.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=17457a0c5fa91f71e641a510ce8aede7927d180d)\n\nWhat chart could look better than ETH's, almost doubling in a month, you ask? Well, the answer is simple - LTO. It seems to have caught fire going into the new year, nearly doubling the investment from last month, where it was already the #3 performer. LTO doesn't seem to show any sign of slowing down either, entering the top 200 strong and continuing to grow even as I type this post out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#1 - DOGE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[But of course. Wait, what? What's happening?](https://preview.redd.it/06k1d4smwh961.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd64c5d4766aae602e273139544024f3d01ec2ca)\n\nIn a twist basically no one could've expected, DOGE is far and away the biggest and best winner of the month. It's not even remotely close. At one point, DOGE has **QUADRUPLED** the initial investment, and only recently started to peter back down as dumbfounded holders realized their riches. It made XRP's rise last month look like a blip on the radar. Funny, because last month DOGE was a perennial underperformer, but it's tripled its valuation since then. Don't let your memes be dreams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Overall, the $500 portfolio has risen in value **36.14%** from last months  **$756.06** to be worth **$1029.25** \n\nIf the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, it would now be worth **$111.**\n\n If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \\* $31,400) it would be worth **$1108.42**\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite a great rise, Bitcoin has outperformed the Reddit portfolio this month, but with such a huge rise, that surely wasn't too unexpected. Most alts are playing catchup and it might take a while to see the value of all the coins with a bright and shiny $30k+ Bitcoin in the sky.\n\nShoutouts to  [u/Wulkingdead](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wulkingdead)  (ETH),  [u/CryptoNarf](https://www.reddit.com/u/CryptoNarf)  (LTO) and  [u/TheRealMotherOfOP](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRealMotherOfOP) (DOGE) for winning this month. \n\nUntil next month, keep your DOGE miners going!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nezfi3m9yh961.gif",

December has brought us even more fun in terms of Bitcoin&#39;s mad run, where it&#39;s been banging on the doors of all time highs nearly the entire month!  Did the coins everyone here picked hold up? Did they explode with Bitcoin&#39;s huge rise? Let&#39;s find out:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IDVJwil.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/IDVJwil.jpg</a> - December 5th Update </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TwNZh1U.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/TwNZh1U.jpg</a> - January 5th Update</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/edit?usp=sharing</a> - Updated Spreadsheet</p>\n\n<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As usual, let&#39;s start with the worst performer of the month.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#10: XRP</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uk5i2ffiqh961.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b39286cfbeeaea09c219560cc16ea66715134ad9\">What a fall from grace.</a></p>\n\n<p>As I&#39;m sure many of you have been watching, the implosion of XRP has been nothing short of spectacular. What was worth almost triple the last month&#39;s price is now down <em>below the original investment.</em> And this is WITH Bitcoin almost doubling in price! It&#39;s been a sad fall for the former #3 coin on the ladder, being replaced with everyone&#39;s good friend Tether. Womp womp. We&#39;ll have to see if the coming months have any better news for XRP fans.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#9 - XMR</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0dpvcox5rh961.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20c5bfb6ac9235663608f576870342f0d185eb5e\">A steady, but ultimately boring grind.</a></p>\n\n<p>Keeping with the pace of last month, Monero continues to underperform the market and only rise slightly. Despite Bitcoin launching into the stratosphere, Monero has been hit with some delistings and uncertainty towards its future on several exchanges. It began to rise with the pack but was slapped down with the bad news. The total XMR value only rose $2 in a month, not the most stellar performance.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#8 - SOL</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w6vyugwwrh961.png?width=652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368293571b6a3202e4be5d4fc2e9fd8771f3ffa0\">Hills and Valleys.</a></p>\n\n<p>SOL actually had me worried for a while, with a shattering drop all the way down to $1.17, which marked a very long time low for the coin. However, it has since rallied and almost doubled its price since then, coming in with modest profits instead of large losses. Definitely an interesting price watch for the month.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#7 - IOTA</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4117j1bfsh961.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=343eaa9da3055e3d3ea59c842e58c80fe7a2500c\">The price appears to be a little... tangled.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Another barely-mover for the month, IOTA got us a whopping $5. It seems the price action is somewhat erratic and not necessarily tied to Bitcoin whatsoever, falling on days where Bitcoin does well, and doing well when Bitcoin has off days. Still, it stayed in the same range for most of the month, not really doing anything special or anything dire either. If this was a blue chip stock, you&#39;d probably still love its monthly returns.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#6 - NANO</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hmrc5qn2th961.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c71ad29f1cbf14b7187bc1347141e24b75975965\">Doing a bit of mountain climbing.</a></p>\n\n<p>Nano came out of nowhere with a mediocre monthly performance, sitting around the dollar range, when suddenly a giant spike of volume propelled the coin as high as +70% of its monthly levels. Since then, it has been largely falling back to earth, but still retains quite a bit of its gains, pushing it firmly over the 100% profit margin. Will Nano continue to show strength as both Bitcoin and Ethereum congest and have wild fee increases, or was this one of many fakeouts?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#5 - ADA</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lkmgi0epth961.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5440df0139733e69ed12d28dffd1e0b343c0187\">A coin on a mission.</a></p>\n\n<p>ADA had a largely mediocre performance most of December, but picked it up as Bitcoin went meteoric, following it to new heights. Excitement of the project getting somewhat close to completion and new buyers entering the market looking at the top 10 had ADA popping off during the last couple of weeks. Can it keep this momentum going into the new year?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#4 - VET</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5d2kbyubuh961.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eacf45d195c5a3fc37f665f9547a22fc22ae2cf8\">A slight fall into a meteoric rise.</a></p>\n\n<p>VET started off the month strong but lulled a bit as BTC went wild over the Christmas holidays. However, like ADA, it has since shot up incredibly fast and has continued to hold a lot of its gains. Both ADA and VET are inching closer to their 2017-2018 all time highs, nowhere close to the top but unlike a lot of Coins from that era are showing remarkable strength going into the new year.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3 - ETH</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/daflae14vh961.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e1e3e936817f23469245532ed1e8d0b271117e1\">Money printer go BRRRR.</a></p>\n\n<p>ETH&#39;s chart is basically what you want to see in any Coin this month, it&#39;s basically a straight trend upwards. ETH&#39;s momentum this month has been largely unstoppable with ETH2 news coming out and the large DEFI following - It looks positioned to do very well and uphold the big responsibility of being the #2 coin. With news of stablecoins being vetted by the US Government, it may perform even better in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2 - LTO</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nyiecvbnvh961.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17457a0c5fa91f71e641a510ce8aede7927d180d\">Disgusting growth.</a></p>\n\n<p>What chart could look better than ETH&#39;s, almost doubling in a month, you ask? Well, the answer is simple - LTO. It seems to have caught fire going into the new year, nearly doubling the investment from last month, where it was already the #3 performer. LTO doesn&#39;t seem to show any sign of slowing down either, entering the top 200 strong and continuing to grow even as I type this post out. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1 - DOGE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/06k1d4smwh961.png?width=652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd64c5d4766aae602e273139544024f3d01ec2ca\">But of course. Wait, what? What&#39;s happening?</a></p>\n\n<p>In a twist basically no one could&#39;ve expected, DOGE is far and away the biggest and best winner of the month. It&#39;s not even remotely close. At one point, DOGE has <strong>QUADRUPLED</strong> the initial investment, and only recently started to peter back down as dumbfounded holders realized their riches. It made XRP&#39;s rise last month look like a blip on the radar. Funny, because last month DOGE was a perennial underperformer, but it&#39;s tripled its valuation since then. Don&#39;t let your memes be dreams.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>_________________________________________________________________ </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the $500 portfolio has risen in value <strong>36.14%</strong> from last months  <strong>$756.06</strong> to be worth <strong>$1029.25</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, it would now be worth <strong>$111.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 * $31,400) it would be worth <strong>$1108.42</strong></p>\n\n<p>_________________________________________________________________ </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Despite a great rise, Bitcoin has outperformed the Reddit portfolio this month, but with such a huge rise, that surely wasn&#39;t too unexpected. Most alts are playing catchup and it might take a while to see the value of all the coins with a bright and shiny $30k+ Bitcoin in the sky.</p>\n\n<p>Shoutouts to  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Wulkingdead\">u/Wulkingdead</a>  (ETH),  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/CryptoNarf\">u/CryptoNarf</a>  (LTO) and  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRealMotherOfOP\">u/TheRealMotherOfOP</a> (DOGE) for winning this month. </p>\n\n<p>Until next month, keep your DOGE miners going!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/nezfi3m9yh961.gif\">https://i.redd.it/nezfi3m9yh961.gif</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
