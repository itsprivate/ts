Crypto isn't dead, in fact its growing faster in just the last 4 months than anytime in its history.\n\n\n You will need to DCA over the next few months though. Last crash took 1 year to hit bottom, and 2 years to see green (from the last ATH).  If you DCA, you will see green sooner than anyone who bought at the top and is just hodling.\n\n\nRight now what is happening is whales that bought into crypto at the bottom in 2018-2019 after the first historical crash, are selling their positions.They are selling them to YOU and calling it a dip. They are telling you to buy this dip. You can if you want, it will help lower your overall average, but theres no telling where the bottom is. Personally I think BTC will hit bottom around 10k-15k, And ETH around 400-700, but I could be wrong, which is why its not a terrible idea to DCA anyway. But just be aware that the 'dips' you're buying are actually what the whales are selling to you. They plan on buying back in at some point.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. This may take a few months to a couple years to recover from, but don't worry, its only temporary. This is a good and necessary process in markets to shake off the paper hands and see who is really in it for the long run. Don't listen to the news about China or whatever other FUD is being created to get you to sell and think its the end of crypto. Crypto is just beginning.",
