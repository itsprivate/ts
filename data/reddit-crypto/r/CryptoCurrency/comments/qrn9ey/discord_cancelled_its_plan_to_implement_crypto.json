Over 100k posts were made on the Discord forums, threatening Discord to either stop their adoption of crypto, or these nocoiners will cancel their Discord subscription. Several popular accounts posted threads on Twitter asking people to &quot;vote with their money&quot; and cancel their Discord subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, Discord pulled the plug. </p>\n\n<p>Absolutely no one from crypto side told Discord that their move was welcome. No one tried to tell Discord how wrong these nocoiner arguments were.  </p>\n\n<p>Majority of those in crypto were happy to be shilling their coins here, watching numbers go up while yet another big company did a 180 on adopting crypto due to the pressure from nocoiners. They are so far winning these battles. </p>\n\n<p>As a community, we need to do better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
