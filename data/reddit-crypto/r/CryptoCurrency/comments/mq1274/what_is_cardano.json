This stage was focused on building a community to support  the creation of Cardano. It allowed the users to buy&sell ADA on the  Ouroboros protocol which is the first PoS protocol underpinned by  academic research and a mathematically proven level of security.\n* **Decentralization**  (Shelley (done)): ensuring greater security and robustness. In this  stage, nodes/serves/stake-pools (blocks of data) are hosted by more and  more network participants leading it to become decentralized. **The  more decentralized the less risk of compromise by malicious behaviour.  Cardano will be 50-100x more decentralized than other major blockchain  networks and thus more secure.**\n* **Smart contracts**  (Goguen (Q2/Q3 2021) ft. Alonzo (last hardfork) ft. Mary (done) ft.  Allegra(done)): enterprise ready smart contract creation and management.  This stage adds the ability to build decentralized applications (DApps)  on Cardano's solid foundation of peer-reviewed research and  high-assurance development. Critically, it **enables  users from technical and non-technical background to create and execute  functional smart contract. This supports the development of  enterprise-level smart contracts for mission-critical applications.**\n* **Scalability**  (Basho(2021)): establishing unrivalled high-performance resilience.  This stage focuses on optimization and the underlying performance of  Cardano network, improving scalability and interoperability. This  includes the **introduction of  side chains (new blockchains interoperable with the main Cardano chain)  increasing the capacity of the network and enabling experimental  features without impacting security. This means secure and reliable  scalability and thus maintainability.**\n* **Governance**  (Voltaire (2021) ft. Project Catalyst): establishing  self-sustainability to secure the future. This stages ensures that  Cardano can be maintained and improved over time. It sees the addition  of a [treasury system](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xny1W7HhHANLNeQcnbr8El5rakJ80VIM7fgDwJ-uqys/edit#gid=0) (400 million ADA or 0.5 billion $ at present time and growing each epoch(=5 days)) **whereby  a fraction of all transaction fees are pooled to provide funds for  development activities undertaken following the voting process. this  stage makes Cardano truly decentralized and future-proof and transfers  management (*****power to the edges*****) to the community.**\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM3BeuencIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM3BeuencIs)",
