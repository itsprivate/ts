After getting burned when Crypty.com stole 3 of my BTC and millions of DOGE and lots of LTC years ago I finally decided to get back into the market.</p>\n\n<p>All of my Crypto.com, and robin hood transactions are pretty straightforward I would just download the CVS file or look at my transactions. But my Coinbase stuff is weird because I was transferring back and forth to Coinbase Pro and making trades. I don&#39;t see where to see my transactions on Bitmart. Also I have Coinbase wallet in which I sent a lot of Eth to buy stuff on Uniswap and I don&#39;t see a record of transactions on their either. </p>\n\n<p>What happens if I just sell all my shit and don&#39;t pay any taxes, would I be fucked? I&#39;m not high income or anything and while it&#39;s 5 figures it&#39;s not a massive amount of money. I honestly just don&#39;t know where to start on the tax stuff. My grandma always does my taxes. I have sold some crypto some years in the past and never claimed taxes but it wasn&#39;t nearly this much.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
