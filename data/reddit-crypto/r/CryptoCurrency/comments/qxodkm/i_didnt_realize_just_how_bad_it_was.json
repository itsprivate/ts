Well, because it&#39;s futurama and of course it does, the math in that episode checks out. $0.93X(1+0.0225)^1000=$4283508449.71</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m sure many of you reading this post noticed the problem here. The episode featured a bank with a 2.25% interest rate. The average interest rate on a savings account is 0.06% and that&#39;s double what a checking account offers (<a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/banking/average-bank-interest-rates\">https://www.valuepenguin.com/banking/average-bank-interest-rates</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So, let&#39;s do this math again. .06%/100=0.0006                      $0.93X(1+0.0006)^1000=$1.69(nice)</p>\n\n<p>That means that instead of being a billionaire, fry&#39;s bank account would have accumulated a total of 76.4 cents. In 1000 years. It would take 1155.6 years for the average bank account to double. I knew banks sucked and I knew these interest rates were abysmal but this was still insane to see on my calculator.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
