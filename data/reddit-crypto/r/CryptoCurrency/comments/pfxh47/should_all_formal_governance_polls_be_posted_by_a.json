These polls would be distinguished so they do not earn moons.  This account should have little to no moons to distract users from the poll.  This would allow a much smoother organization of moon week, with all polls being posted at once</p>\n\n<p>Note:  This does not affect normal polls such as &quot;What is your favorite crypto wallet?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There are a few potential downsides to this that I can think of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The author of the poll does not get pinged with every reply, so they can&#39;t answer questions or defend their idea as easily</li>\n<li>The author does not get credit or moons for their proposal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>(This poll will be distinguished in a few days, but not immediately since that could give it more visibility and an unfair advantage over other polls)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/pfxh47\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
