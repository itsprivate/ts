It was only after I moved my crypto off the exchange that I fully comprehended what the blockchain is. You have full custody of a piece of encrypted data. In effect, you are the spymaster running a spy ring consisting of little agents called BTC, ETH and ADA or whatever. You even get a secret phrase to interact with them! </p>\n\n<p><em>This is the coolest fucking thing ever.</em></p>\n\n<p>If you lose the secret phrase, your agents are lost in hostile country forever. It’s one hell of a responsibility, but you’re up for it, damn it all. Don’t let them down. You can hide your phrase in a secret place or in any number of devious spy master-y ways. You can forget about your agents, leave them in deep cover, for years and years and re-activate them only when you want. It’s entirely up to you. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s just me that felt this rush of excitement ... but let’s put the crypto back into the crypto experience, though. Maybe this could be the hook to get the normie investors back in (Don’t tell them about how if you enter the wrong wallet address you’ll never see it again, we need them through the door first.) 🙂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
