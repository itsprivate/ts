Been a member here since the beginning of the year and just wanted to share my little story with you all. \n\nI’ve spent the last 10+ years with depression, lack of enthusiasm or energy to achieve anything, not because I didn’t want to but I’ve always had this barrier. I’m also someone that is very isolated, without any close friends and finds it hard to meet others. \nI used to walk the earth feeling pretty empty, as if I had no place or real purpose. \n\nTo make myself feel better I would often collect things that made me happy, video games, movies and records, quite obsessively. I would squander funds on these things just to distract myself from my depression.\n\nNow that brings me here, since investing in crypto from the beginning of 2021 and being a part of this community, I now feel like I have a place, a purpose even.. I feel happy knowing I’m not alone here, I have new friends and a new place to come hang out everyday! \nGenuinely blessed to share this space with you guys \n\nOh and I’ve managed to 3x my investment since that time, now I’m smiling :)",
