It is the perfect medium of exchange for the emerging world because of its enviable lightning-fast speed and its ability to confirm a higher number of transactions per second that allows quick transfer of value and a permanent proof of ownership in the metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As physical limitations are poised on everyone around post the pandemic stresses on the need for alternatives, and metaverse seems to fit the puzzle right in because it is the replica of the real world, just that you have the flexibility to drive in and out of it. &lt;a href=\"https://thenewscrypto.com/newscrypto-pivots-to-metaverse-utilizing-enjins-efinity-blockchain/?r=1\"&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; will be the most important frontier for bringing crypto into the mainstream.&lt;br/&gt;\nI believe most companies are interested in adopting this technology and they  will benefit substantially from it. Most importantly the individuals/gamers/etc.. I’m excited how the world will transform with all these changes but we can surely expect that the change is going to be huge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
