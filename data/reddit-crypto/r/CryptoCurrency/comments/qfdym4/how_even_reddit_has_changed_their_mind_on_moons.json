For example, <strong>you can accept Points as proof of Reddit</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>reputation on your site, create private spaces for Points holders, or accept Points in exchange</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>for goods and services.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I dont need to explain anything on this now you guys know it,</p>\n\n<p>and i think its time to take away the restriction on posting about *X sites on the sub,</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
