I&amp;#39;m dying).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd Disclaimer: Being invested in crypto nor eating a vegan diet is bad, pushing the idea everywhere is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But think about it. With families coming together over the holidays. Do you want to be the family member pushing his ideas to anyone there? Is it so hard to just be normal for a day or two?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you think you are helping, if someone is not interested, understand it. It&amp;#39;s not for everyone, yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Do what you want, but don&amp;#39;t push your ideas to everyone around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: As a comment by &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chriswuz/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chriswuz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think the post is about that phase where we discover new ways in life and we forget about friends and family just talking about that. It really sucks to be around someone only talking about a single subject and trying to turn everybody to it.&amp;quot; -This, and it goes for any topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
