Think of it as a promotion where you get paid to often learn about or join a community.\n\nI've put a few low effort ones down here that I've personally used and can vouch for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase:**\n\nMost of you have probably heard of this one, Coinbase has a series of airdrops where you can watch a video and answer a few questions to get a few dollars worth of crypto everytime. The ones that are active at the time of writing are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $3 - NuCypher (NU)\n* $3 - TheGraph (GRT)\n* $6 - Celo (CGLD)\n* $19 - Compound (COMP)\n* $10 - Stellar Lumens (XLM)\n\nThat's **$41** dollars in crypto for free. All you have to do is sign up for an account, complete KYC verification and join the wait list and wait for your invite to complete these. NO DEPOSIT NEEDED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinmarketcap earn:**\n\nThis one is very similar to coinbase, but you'll also need a Binance account. Create both a Coinmarketcap account and a Binance account. Make sure to complete KYC verification on your Binance account. Next go to [https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/) and complete the quizzes to earn crypto. There's no waitlist here, just know that tokens are distributed at the end of the period (March 1st).\n\nYou'll need a Binance account since the crypto will be airdropped into your Binance wallet. If you need help with the quizzes, the answers are readily available on Google. Some have extra requirements though, but it is all explained on their respective pages. Current airdrops are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $10 - Nervos Network (CKB)\n* $10 - 1inch (1INCH)\n* $10 - TheGraph (GRT)\n* $10 - The Sandbox (SAND)\n\nThis **$40** is an estimate based on what I've earned in the past and what's available in information right now. End result may vary (but not by alot). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Airdropbob:**\n\nAirdropbob is a website that puts together a list of all the different kind of airdrops. Some are low effort, some are not. I highly suggest you check them out at [https://www.airdropbob.com/](https://www.airdropbob.com/) and see what they offer for yourselves!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l63d6f6s0mj61.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=852a3e2ae4ebb9babf41650e3516295139deadbf\n\nThat's it for now!
