I&#39;ve stuck with mostly BTC and ETH for hodling, but I&#39;ve also put smaller amounts of money into some altcoins with hopes of faster growth.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to buy some TEL when it was at .009 last month. It felt like a risk since the market was struggling, but I also felt like (and still feel like!) it was a solid coin.  I sold when my investment more than doubled a few days ago; and I knew exactly where that money needed to go.</p>\n\n<p>Our dog has been the happiest little wheelchair user since she became paralyzed three years ago. We had the one in the pic custom made for her, and it&#39;s amazing. It has big wheels that give her a lot of stability and help when she&#39;s outdoors -- it&#39;s great for hikes -- but it&#39;s about twice as wide as she is. Watching her get stuck or hung up on furniture and corners when she&#39;s inside breaks my heart.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s getting older, and I want her to have assistance that makes indoor movement extra easy for her. So I was just able to use my TEL earnings to order a simpler cart with a smaller frame.</p>\n\n<p>Some people might say this is a frivolous purchase. Or maybe that I should have continued to hodl instead of selling. But I get so much joy from making our dog happier that it&#39;s 100% worth taking action now so my pup can live her best life.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r9ts9i7vxkh71.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=727efc16f95a845c986e28c14a7b847662d77723\">https://preview.redd.it/r9ts9i7vxkh71.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=727efc16f95a845c986e28c14a7b847662d77723</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Proof: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vqwr6eajclh71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8abedd494082a0a632d3de33c92e5debeaedb633\">https://preview.redd.it/vqwr6eajclh71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8abedd494082a0a632d3de33c92e5debeaedb633</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
