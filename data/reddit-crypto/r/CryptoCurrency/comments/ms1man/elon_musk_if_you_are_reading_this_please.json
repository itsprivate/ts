This is no good for the people who are creating the future of the FinTech. This is no good for our visibility.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s be honest here, “dumb money” and new retail investors are approaching the crypto world with doge right now, putting there their money and I’m afraid also their life savings. New joiners have no clue of how mean can be volatility, especially on a coin like this. They don’t know what to do, they don’t have an exit strategy. They just see green, +200% and your tweets. They are gonna lose money, blame crypto and flag it as a scam. Once again. Please, know what you are doing.</p>\n\n<p>Doge army is gonna downvote like crazy, but I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one being worried about this.</p>\n\n<p>Update: small edits, typos</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
