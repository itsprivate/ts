Making bold assertions about the legitimacy of one party or another and accusing the other of corruption, is as old as politics itself. Without evidence, citations and sources, it’s all just conjecture or opinion based on biases and incomplete evidence.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>⁠Its volatility could prove an issue, but then again, they do stand to gain from holding the asset as well. (Does the average citizen follow charts on the daily?)</p></li>\n<li><p>There are numerous  international legal obligations that will have to be resolved - countries (including US) obliged to accept BTC as a legal ‘foreign’ currency.</p></li>\n<li><p>⁠Implications for the unbanked becoming part of the ‘formal’ economy - more taxes paid but informal economies are often vital in small rural communities.</p></li>\n<li><p>Will the government be taking a large part of all the remittances that are sent, through their app? (To pay for essential infrastructure or off-shore funds?)</p></li>\n<li><p>The sheer fact that someone pays for their bus journey or groceries in bitcoin does not automatically mean they are financially secure, let alone wealthy.</p></li>\n<li><p>⁠Will the government become more accountable and transparent as a consequence of Bitcoin adoption, or will it become even easier to syphon funds away from the people into the hands of corruption, nepotism and greed?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>. . . </p>\n\n<h3>However, one thing is clear, while the debates rage on, the notion that ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is essential for cryptocurrency to grow and thrive.</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coinchapter-f476.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg\">.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
