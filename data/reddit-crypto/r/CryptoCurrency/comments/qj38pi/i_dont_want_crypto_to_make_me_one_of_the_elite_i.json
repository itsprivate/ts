For me, money in itself isn&#39;t the goal, and I feel like it shouldn&#39;t be for most people. I don&#39;t want to be &quot;at the top 1%&quot;. I don&#39;t want to be above anyone. I just want money so I can live my life without fear and anxiety, so I can do the things I&#39;ve always wanted to do and support those I love, enjoying life to the fullest.</p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re in crypto, always remember your goal. The point at which you&#39;d be willing to pull out and use that money you gained. Remember, we&#39;re not immortal dragons, sitting atop our pile of gold ain&#39;t gonna bring us any happiness if we die without spending any of it. </p>\n\n<p>Life is there to be lived and enjoyed, and that, to me, is what crypto can offer me. Freedom.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
