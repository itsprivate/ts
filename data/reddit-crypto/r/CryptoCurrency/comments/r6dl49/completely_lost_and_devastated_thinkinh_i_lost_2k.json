Everything was nice and clear at that point. \nSo after 2 days of farming i eraned like 45usd and decided to move everything back to my crypto com wallet because i was afraid something would go wrong with farming and it would be safer just sitting on crypto com wallet watching CRO go up\nSo what i did is unpair liquidity token cro-vvs and transferred all vvs to cro right there, and ended up with about 1950CRO  on VVS finance\nSo since this 1950cro was on cronos chain i swapped it back to crypto org on DeFi wallet, and should have ended up with (1900+1950) 3850 CRO on my DeFi wallet, instead it was 1976 CRO total on my wallet, i assumed something just didnt transferred yet or it is some bug, so i transferred all 1976 to crypto com app successfuly and started to wait for remaining CRO to drop on defi wallet\n7 hours past and i still have only  1976 cro on crypto com and nothing else anywhere else. So i left with half of all my money and i dont know how that could happened, dont know where i did wrong and where i fucked up so much, please guys i need your help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
