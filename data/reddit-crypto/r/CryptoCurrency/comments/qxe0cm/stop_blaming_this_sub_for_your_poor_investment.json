At best, you can use this sub to get a feel for the general sentiment around a project, but the most shilled coin on here can tank 80% the next day, and a coin everybody laughs off can go +1000% the next week. Crypto is always a gamble.</p>\n\n<p>So don&#39;t take what people say here as investment advice and then complain when it doesn&#39;t work out for you. Every investment you make is 100% your responsibility, and you shouldn&#39;t invest in something if you are completely confident about the risks-rewards involved.</p>\n\n<p>Good Luck</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr - You are 100% responsible for your investments. Do your own research instead of blindly trusting strangers&#39; advice.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
