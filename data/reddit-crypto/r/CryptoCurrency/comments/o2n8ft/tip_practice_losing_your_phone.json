Congrats moon farmers, I'm upvoting every reply here.\n\nEdit2: to everyone saying thanks for the advice, you're welcome. I hope this thread can actually save at least one person from preventable loss.\nFor people saying they've lost access before and wish they had done this sooner, that fucking sucks and I'm sorry to hear.
