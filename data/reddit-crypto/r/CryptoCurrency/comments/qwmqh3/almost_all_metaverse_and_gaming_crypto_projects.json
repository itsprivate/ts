When the next bear market hits, and it will hit hard, I am sure that it will wipe out 90% of all the new created gaming and metaverse projects  out there.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2018 crash we saw a lot of memecoins disappear, in this one we will certainly add a lot of Metaverse and Gaming coins into the &quot;shitcoin bin&quot; during the next bear market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
