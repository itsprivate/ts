  "selftext": "The Complete Guide to Coinbase Fees (and How to Avoid Them)\n\nThere are so many new subs to this forum and a lot of them are Coinbase users. Yeah Coinbase has a cool graph that shows you your portfolio. It’s also very easy to use for a beginner. \n\nNow there is nothing wrong with Coinbase (except, of course, the mind boggling fees) but I haven’t seen any post addressing how to use Coinbase without paying crazy fees or at least the best strategy to pay as little fees as possible. So here we go. \n\nQuick (or not so quick) overview of fees:\n\nBuying Fixed Fees\n\n* If the total transaction amount is less than or equal to $10, the fee is $0.99\n* If the total transaction amount is more than $10 but less than or equal to $25, the fee is $1.49\n* If the total transaction amount is more than $25 but less than or equal to $50, the fee is $1.99\n* If the total transaction amount is more than $50 but less than or equal to $200, the fee is $2.99\n\nTLDR\n$10 or less $0.99 fee\n$10.01-$25 $1.49 fee\n$25.01-$50 $1.99 fee\n$50.01-$200 $2.99 fee\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!\n\nBuying Variable Fees:\n\nUS Bank Account 1.49%\nCoinbase USD Wallet 1.49%\nDebit Card or PayPal 3.99%\n\nBUT WAIT THERES EVEN MORE!! \n\nCoinbase charges a spread of about one-half of one percent (0.50%) for cryptocurrency purchases and cryptocurrency sales. However, the actual spread may be higher or lower due to market fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency on Coinbase Pro between the time we quote a price and the time when the order executes. \n\nThis means if you buy bitcoin and the market price is $50,000, they will charge you the purchase price of $50,000 plus half a percent. So you’ll be getting less bitcoin than you should be, by half of a percent. They do this is case there is a crazy spike in price between the time you confirm and the transaction actually goes through. \n\nCONVERSIONS\n\nFor conversions from one coin to the other, you’ll be charged a spread fee which is equal to or less than 2%. \n\nReal life example\n\nYou buy $10 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $8.96\n\nYou buy $25 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $23.39\n\nYou buy $50 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $47.77\n\nYou buy $200 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $196.02\n\nYou buy $1000 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $980.39\n\nNow you also have to pay these fees when you are selling. So here is what we have if you bought and sold at same price:\n\nYou buy $10 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $8.96\nAfter selling $7.97\nOver 20% lost\n\nYou buy $25 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $23.39\nAfter selling $21.90\nOver 12% lost\n\nYou buy $50 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $47.77\nAfter selling $45.78\nOver 8% lost\n\nYou buy $200 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $196.02\nAfter selling $193.03\nOver 3.5% lost\n\nYou buy $1000 in crypto\nAfter fees you have $980.39\nAfter selling $965.78\nOver 3.4% lost\n\nNow how do we not get killed on fees?\n\n1. Use Coinbase Pro if possible. Fees are capped at 0.5% no matter how much you buy. You can transfer between Coinbase and Coinbase pro free of charge. \n2. If you’re going to buy anything, buy at least $200 worth of it. Do NOT buy small amounts of something on here. If your DCA, instead of doing $50 every week, do $200 every four weeks. \n3. Do not day trade. It’s hard to make money day trading when you’re automatically down 5% just from fees. \n4. Use bank account to buy coins, not debit card. \n5. Only buy when market is going up. If you buy when it’s going down you will end up paying even more due to their spread fee (yes I know, hard to know when it’s going to go up). \n6. Use Coinbase if you’re planning on holding coins for a long time. \n\nI really just recommend you to use Binance.us or kraken. If you buy $100 worth of bitcoin, your fees are only $0.05 on Binance!!! \n\nHope this helped. Let me know if I missed anything! \n\nTLDR; If you really have to use Coinbase, only purchase $200 or more at a given time. Don’t day trade, and hold for long periods of time. If you can use a different exchange like Binance, switch over.",
