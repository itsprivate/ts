I bought bitcoin way below $300 and I wouldn&#39;t claim I know sh*t about f*ck. Because I don&#39;t know sh*t about f*ck. <a href=\"/r/bitcoin\">/r/bitcoin</a> was just as dumb as it is now in 2014-2015, people already had no clue what they were doing but were confident about it. It was already a sh*tton of hopium, FOMO, and the usual cr*p.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it that way. Suppose you go to the casino, and you meet some creepy guy at the door being like &quot;dude, I&#39;ve had a gambling addiction for five years, I can give you good advice about how to make money&quot;. Would you trust him? Of course you wouldn&#39;t. Because it&#39;s obvious he doesn&#39;t know sh*t about f*ck.</p>\n\n<p>Well it&#39;s the same here. Old-timers, newcomers. Nobody knows sh*t about f*ck.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: formatting</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
