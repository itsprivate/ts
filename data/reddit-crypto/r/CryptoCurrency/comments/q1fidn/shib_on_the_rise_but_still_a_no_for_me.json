It‚Äôs become really interesting to understand what projects do, what their utility is. Ive started to DCA into coins I believe in, ATOM, SOL, ETH, because I believe that regardless of market situations, their utility will help them continue growing. </p>\n\n<p>Meme coins feel like playing the lotto. A lot of people love the lotto. I never play. I feel pretty strongly that I‚Äôm meant to earn money and invest, but not just luck into riches. </p>\n\n<p>Again, congrats to anyone making money on any crypto, but I‚Äôll stick to my utility based bag of coins. </p>\n\n<p>Rant over, thanks üôè</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
