Please be careful and do not trust the website right now. If it’s too good to be true it’s too good to be true. Never send your coins to anyone in hopes of a return. Let’s hope the domain hoster will return the domain to the rightful owners, so unsuspecting visitors of the website won’t fall for this scam.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts will track every movement of the funds in the wallet now. In case the funds will touch any exchange they will most likely be freezed and seized. The hackers will likely use an atomic swap towards Monero to make the funds liquid and to stay anonymous.</p>\n\n<h1>STAY SAFE EVERYONE!</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
