Bitcoin losing 20k in value over the past few weeks, and over 10k in over a day, is a &lt;strong&gt;crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who say &amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;quot; on this subreddit are literally in it for themselves, they hope that people will see their hopium-titled thread and suddenly the market will go back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not how it works. This subreddit does not control the market swings. Whales do. Financial institutions do. Early investors do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no influence over this. Please stop telling people &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s just a dip&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s not. This is a crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much more it will crash? 100% no one knows. But yes, this is insane price action right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we&amp;#39;re still up a lot since the middle of this year, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make this less of a crash since the ATH.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
