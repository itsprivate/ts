  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Spreading awareness for Alchemy Pay one of the most underrated Altcoins in my opinion, and one of the most misunderstood as well. Common misconception.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not based in China, it&#39;s based in Singapore</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s primary target is merchants/retailers/exchanges/smart chains. They provide a FIAT/CRYPTO payment gateway. Currently most businesses have to pay TWO payment gateways if they want to accept both CRYPTO and FIAT streamlining the process. They also now are providing FIAT on ramps to one L2 (MATIC) and three L1&#39;s (NEO/TRON/NEAR). They also are partnered with BINANCE PAY and CRYPTO.COM Pay providing Crypto-&gt;FIAT payments (Most likely in Asian countries considering the mass amount of Asian banks they are partnered with.) <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/MJkaWrJ\">Recent slides from CoinTelegraph Conference.</a> - Partnerships not fully updated on slide this was before the TRON, NEO, MATIC, ARPA, and NEAR announcements.</p>\n\n<p>Alchemy Pay already has a real physical product and a service providing point of sales systems deployed in Singapore, Hong Kong, and other South Asian countries as well as Europe. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJRUFKkrzY\">EXAMPLE</a> of instant BTC-&gt;FIAT payment. <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/polygon-deploys-fiat-on-ramps-via-alchemy-pay-enabling-direct-fiat-payments-for-defi/\">Article from Polygon partnership mentioning daily Crypto-&gt;Fiat transaction amounts grossly $5 million processed daily.</a></p>\n\n<p>CoinmarketCap Link - Still under 300M marketcap with huge growth potential. Also there was a leak today involving a tweet mentioning working with a South African country to develop a cryptocurrency based economy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnnybravo970/status/1461693924955897862/photo/1\">LEAK HERE.</a></p>\n\n<p>Easy long term hold at under 10 cents and could easily reach .50 cents by EOY with the pace the team has been dropping partnerships.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT** Forgot to add they are soon to be releasing their own Global VISA/MASTERCARD Crypto Cards supporting up to 40 cryptocurrencies as well as NFT cards with NFT artist Ting Song. Twitter Link <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Song11Ting/status/1456451475589111813\">HERE</a> which will include white label service to other companies. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
