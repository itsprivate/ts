Let's use ADA as an example. On the Binance exchange if you stake your ADAs for 15 days you can get an APY of 17.79% (This 17.79% is a promotion, the usual APY would be 5.09% for 30 days, &.79% for 60 days and 9.32% for 90 days).\n\nIt involves holding funds in a **cryptocurrency** wallet to support the security and operations of a **blockchain** network. **Simply** put, **staking** is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards. In most cases, you'll be able to stake your coins directly from your **crypto**wallet. One example is the Trust  Wallet.\n\n***Once again if you plan to HODL, then staking is a good friend of yours.***\n\nIn simple English: You **giveth** to stake and you **taketh** more cryptos",
