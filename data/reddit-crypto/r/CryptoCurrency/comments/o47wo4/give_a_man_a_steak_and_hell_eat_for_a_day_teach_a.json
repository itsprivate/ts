Let's use ADA as an example. On the Binance exchange if you stake your ADAs for 15 days you can get an APY of 17.79% (This 17.79% is a promotion, the usual APY would be 5.09% for 30 days, &.79% for 60 days and 9.32% for 90 days).\n\nIt involves holding funds in a **cryptocurrency** wallet to support the security and operations of a **blockchain** network. **Simply** put, **staking** is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards.
