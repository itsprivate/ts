The value 100 stands for the highest popularity of this search term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular and a value of 0 means that not enough data was available for this term.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Here is the graph for bitcoin:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/68d3btn346w71.png?width=1399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=059b8b9174e3fd351e0123ee9d4ee84a749972eb\">Google search activity graph for the term &#39;bitcoin&#39;</a></p>\n\n<p>And here the graph for ethereum:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1ih38f0446w71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29a788f30c5d36b4114d53bd176bfde14fd3f26\">Google search activity graph for the term &#39;ethereum&#39;</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>We can see that the Google search activity is roughly related to the market capitalization. However, even though we reached new ATHs just a week ago and will most likely achieve new ones soon, the search activity is nowhere near the top. Once it reaches new highs again, it should trigger a huge inflow of money into crypto and thus a push to levels never seen before.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Nothing in this post is financial advice, you are responsible for your own decisions, this is only my personal opinion and I have no clue about anything.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
