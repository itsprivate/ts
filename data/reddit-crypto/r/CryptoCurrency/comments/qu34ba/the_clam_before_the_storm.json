No, that was not a dip that was just a healthy pullback. In the past, I would call that a dip too but after the May crash, FUDs, hopiums, and many more. What has been happing lately is too little for me to pour out any emotions. </p>\n\n<p>So right now, we are experiencing a really clam stage of crypto. This is what I would like to call the &quot;calm before the storm&quot;. Judging from all the previous charts from 2013 and 2017, we have yet to see the parabolic run. But once we see it massive FOMO will kick in and people will go nuts about crypto. So what am I doing now? Well, I am preparing myself mentally. I would not want my emotions to get the better of me and buy near ATHs and be left with holding the bags. I have set my targets to sell and set an amount of my portfolio to HODL indefinitely. </p>\n\n<p>This is the time to recoup your thoughts and your exit and entry strategy. The parabolic run will come and I will take my profits, because when the bear comes and I do want to have some cash flow so I can buy them crypto cheap. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
