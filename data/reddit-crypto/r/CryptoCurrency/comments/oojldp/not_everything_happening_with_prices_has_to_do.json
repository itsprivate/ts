Fact is, we can&#39;t know for sure. So it&#39;s nonsensical to think that whenever you lose money there must be some kind of high powers that are behind it, hell bent on reducing your holdings to zero. I&#39;ve seen it all. I&#39;ve seen Asians blaming the Westerners for &#39;selling&#39; and I&#39;ve seen the Westerners blaming the Asians for &#39;dumping&#39;. Likewise, I&#39;ve seen people attribute pumps to different demographics across the ocean.</p>\n\n<p>This leads us to the question of media FUDs. Again, whenever FUDs drop, this sub attribute the FUDs to &#39;them&#39; as in, &#39;they&#39; want you to sell. Well, it&#39;s true that it&#39;s possible to pay newspapers to drop these FUDs, but again, there isn&#39;t a single entity or a big bad group behind the scene trying to fuck you over. It&#39;s a complex war for interest between hedge funds, institutions, and the policy makers. Attributing the FUDs to a single entity is a very simplistic way to look at the way things operate.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s great to be cynical and to keep your awareness up. But don&#39;t fall too deeply into the rabbit hole and become a conspiracy theorist of the crypto world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
