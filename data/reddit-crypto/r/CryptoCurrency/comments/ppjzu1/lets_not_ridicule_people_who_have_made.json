But why then make people feel bad they probably already know they&#39;ve already messed up. It might well be the first crypto someone has ever brought and too then be ridiculed they might decide they want out of crypto. The community should be trying to make people feel welcome not rip shreds off them? </p>\n\n<p>I personally made a simlar mistake with Doge coin back in February. I&#39;m glad I took everything off here with a pinch of salt, then looked into other crypto and haven&#39;t  looked back since. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously no one knows what shib is going to do next up or down. I&#39;m just making an observation from posts off here</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
