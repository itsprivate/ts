This is an increase of about 218% or more in the past six weeks. With the SEC getting involved and Pyth going live on Solanas network, it&#39;s not difficult to understand why the SOL/USD exchange rate has been going up.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I am glad it didn&#39;t shoot up over night and is instead building solid support over time. This is pretty exciting to watch and I personally feel like it&#39;s a good time to see new coins in the top 10. It&#39;s only a matter of time before Solana hits $100. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers to everyone who got in at $1 - $40, enjoy your profits. Cheers to everyone who realizes that it&#39;s still not too late and that there&#39;s more money to be made even at $90. Last but not least, cheers to everyone believing in its technology.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
