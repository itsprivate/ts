I checked my purchase records just in case and I didnt accidentally buy any. I told myself I wouldn&#39;t get into shit coins. It seems like someone sent it to the wrong address so I&#39;m gonna send it back soon. All though this would be nice to keep if it exploded in price. I&#39;m sure the owner of these coins will be thrilled getting them back. I usually would be the type to say &quot;sucks for you&quot; but I&#39;ve lost some moons before so I know the feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I will do some research before sending just in case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
