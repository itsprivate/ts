It pays people to optimize for actions that are the opposite of reasoned discourse. It further requires administrative overhead and rules to prevent things from melting down completely in a race to the bottom for short term monetary gains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This proposal would remove the post and all comments from consideration for Moons rewards. The method would be a title containing, without the quotes, &amp;#39;[NoMoons]&amp;#39;. The title of a post is immutable after the post is made and still allows flair to work as a filter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can also be an experiment to see if it makes a difference in the quality of the discussions on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency\"&gt;/r/cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Concerns:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest concern is that there may be people who depend on the money they earn here, not all redditers are first world. This would not effect them, they could just ignore the demonetized posts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original draft and discussion: &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/px4apt\"&gt;https://redd.it/px4apt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/rmwg5n\"&gt;View Poll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
