For those of us who have been in this space for a long time, we've experienced panic during our first major correction, and believe me it's no picnic. Sure, you get used to it, but telling someone who just hopped in a few days ago that they don't belong here doesn't really make sense. \n\nImagine seeing a lot of excitement for this new technology everyone is talking about. You do your research, and decide to put in some of your hard-earned money. Suddenly, you lose 10+% of your investment overnight - and all you hear is people telling you that if you're not thrilled about this, you don't belong.\n\nRemember, these posts telling you that it's normal show up at the beginning of every bear market. No one really knows. For sure things seem different this time, with Tesla, Paypal, etc joining the space. But to say with certainty the price can only go up isn't doing anyone, especially newcomers, any favors. This is most likely just a much-needed correction.
