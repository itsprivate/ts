If you'd have said those coins were going to crash 95% (which is what happened) you probably would have been downvoted to oblivion.\n\nI actually think we're still a long way from the peak of this current cycle, but obviously I don't have a clue anymore than anyone else does (who saw the March 2020 crash coming?) But if things continue as they are we're going to be seeing similar price predictions about all kinds of projects over these next few months, so just a friendly reminder to take what you read with a pinch of salt.\n\nDon't be a crypto grandma and believe everything you read, and if you're going to yolo, make sure it's with money you're really ok with losing.\n\nGood luck out there and I hope you're enjoying this wild ride as much as I am!",
