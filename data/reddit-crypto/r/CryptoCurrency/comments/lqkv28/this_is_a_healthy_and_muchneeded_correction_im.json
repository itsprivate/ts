Remember: time in the market beats timing the market. So have patience, the market needs to stabilize a little before going up again. Did you get into crypto expecting an unlimited money printer that goes BRRR?\n\n\nIf you just recently jumped into crypto, I can certainly understand why this dip would make you uneasy. It must feel like you lit your money on fire if your entire portfolio is red and you have no gains to show for it. You’ll know the market is truly in a bad place once the Suicide Hotline number is pinned to the front page. That’s the biggest buy signal you’ll see on this subreddit.\n\n\nMy take? This is just a pit stop before we see higher highs later this year. Don’t be surprised if we stabilize and go flat for a while. But of course, this is not financial advice and everything could come crashing down. Don’t take my word for it. I’m just some dude on Reddit.\n\n\nTake care of yourself. Stop staring at the charts, go drink some water, get 5,000-10,000 steps in. Crypto ain’t leaving.",
