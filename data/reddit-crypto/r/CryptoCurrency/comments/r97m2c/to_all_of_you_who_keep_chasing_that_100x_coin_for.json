Today just shows that even if you did manage to find the golden ticket, you need an iron clad mindset to hodl that bitch through thick and thin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why it’s so crucial to invest money you can afford to lose and pick a project you believe passionately in. It gives you the opportunity to ride that mofo into the sunset since you &lt;em&gt;really don’t&lt;/em&gt; give a fuck if it goes to zero or not. Your options aren’t limited and you can ride that wave alllllllllll the way to the top or the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you’re Keith Gill and you hang the fuck in there no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
