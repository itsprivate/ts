  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a big misunderstanding that leverage trading is either a &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m homeless now&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m a billionaire now&amp;#39; tool, as opposed to being there to simply minimize risk with your trades. There is nothing wrong with using leverage, the issue we&amp;#39;ve seen is that your average Joe does not understand how to properly use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than using it to lower exposure, people are using it maximize their capital. A dangerous game to play in crypto where we know prices can disappear in an instant. A good way to think of it is: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If I have 10,000 USDT in my trading account, and I use 10x leverage, I can make a 10,000 dollar trade using only 1,000 dollars, keeping 90% completely safe and available should I wish to make more trades, or buy the beloved dip.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The incorrect way to think of leverage trading is: &amp;quot;I have 10,000 dollars, if I use 10x leverage I can make it 100,000 dollars! Rinse and repeat, easy money!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;One does not simply YOLO their entire balance at 10x leverage.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - Gandalf, circa 1975.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, do what you want with your money - but please don&amp;#39;t ever over-invest. Always have money to pay the rent and have leftover for ramen. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year - here&amp;#39;s to a huge 2022 ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
