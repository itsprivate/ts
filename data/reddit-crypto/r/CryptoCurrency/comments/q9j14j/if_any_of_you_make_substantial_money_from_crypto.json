Broke people can be friends.. but when I started getting my life together and saving money, I told only some of my friends how much I had. I don&#39;t know if they told other people out of jealousy or what but people I barely knew came out the woodwork asking to borrow money. They and even my friends gave me the cold shoulder when I refused. </p>\n\n<p>I guarantee you it will be the same if you have a substantial amount of money. People get jealous and start acting entitled to your money because they have less.. and that&#39;s not ok. Don&#39;t let ANYONE make you feel bad or guilty if you don&#39;t want to share.. truth is, they have the same opportunities as any of us here and they don&#39;t take them. </p>\n\n<p>You are the ones who wake up everyday, earn your money and learn how to invest it. You don&#39;t owe anyone!\nEven your own family can turn on you.. matter of fact, I&#39;m 35 and I have found family to be the least dependable and the ones who will stab you in the back the most (Not going to apply to everyone obviously)</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe and focused my people!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
