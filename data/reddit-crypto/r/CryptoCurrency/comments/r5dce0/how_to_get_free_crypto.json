I looked at some old posts and most of the comments said that the best and efficient way is by being active on this subreddit. I&#39;ve heard that guys here earn hundreds of dollars a month just by posting and commenting on this subreddit. That would be better than getting a job for me. I want your advice guys. How do I do it?</p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure there are people who are in a similar situation as I am in. I want to hear from you guys about your experience with this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
