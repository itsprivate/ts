Turns out I was deemed an essential worker and was able to keep my job while the market was in complete fluctuations. Bitcoin was around 5k and this other crypto I was researching called ethereum was around ~100 something dollars, I saw it’s ath was over $1000 and thought to myself “wow if I could make a 10x return on an investment I would be able to buy a new car and really begin to be comfortable with my place economically. So I throw money at the wall and it sticks. \n\nAround October or so I have a dream about all the Bitcoin I had in my high school days and wake up in a cold sweat. For the next couple days I try every password and recovery email I could remember and I eventually get my localcoinbase account login. I was SO EXCITED, I had just hit the lottery in my mind and nothing could tell me otherwise. I transfer funds so everything is on one wallet and just literally stare at my money, the most I’ve ever seen as a college dropout working meaningless slightly above state minimum wage jobs…I was literally jumping with joy!!!\n\nNow with Bitcoin over 50k and ethereum pushing close to 2k I can officially say I never dreamed of this moment before. I always had this creeping thought in the back of my mind that I would never “make it” and would settle for a life that I never wanted…GUYS don’t believe that what you’re doing is wrong. I love the projects that these cryptos bring, I hope one day crypto is as mainstream as Netflix and google is. I don’t see that future not coming to fruition..I just can’t pass up this life changing money any longer. \n\nI never posted that much or talked that much but I genuinely hope everyone here reaches their moon <3",
