I don't expect the price to moon any time soon and that's actually a great thing cause I can just keep buying month after month without FOMO.\n\nSo thats me. First post in this sub. A crypto investor, not a trader. 5-10 years horizon at the very least, very curious about where we are headed and what's the space gonna look like by then. Looking forward to learn and grow with you guys!",
