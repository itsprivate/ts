Different targets are being discussed for the bottom, some feel it would be 25k some 15k and some think it may go even lower. </p>\n\n<p>While BTC plays out, many would also be holding altcoins through this bear run. While alts are great during a bull run, during a BTC bear cycle they are some of the worst assets to hold. </p>\n\n<p>During the 2017 bull run too, many favourite altcoins emerged that were shilled here relentlessly. Today you will not find anyone talking about them, and possibly the team / coin has folded too. Some examples are Request Network, Power ledger, Substratum, Vertcoin, Groestlecoin, Waltcon chain, Dash, Qtum, Bytecoin, Omise Go, Ardor, Game Credits, Stratis, Dragon Chain, KIN, Factom etc. These coins also had a huge following back in 2017 bull run. Many were expecting these coins to &quot;change the world&quot;. Daily&#39;s from 2017 and 2018 were filled with mentions of these conis. Some of these coins were notorious and there were massive threads full of shills trying to explain how a chain would take over the world and change businesses for good. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, most of these coins had to fold either due to lack of funds, lack of planning, or just a soft exit scam where the team kinda go MIA during a 2 year bear run. The soft exit scam is the most common and least effort one - in crypto, the developers have to develop something, but they can always say they tried and failed. On to the next one. Tough luck! There are no legal contracts in place that force the devs to deliver anything for you, the token holder. </p>\n\n<p>In this 2020-21 bull run, there are way more altcoins. Many of them clearly struggle for even a single use case. The story with most altcoins is that the devs use them to raise funds,  come up with a list of promises and then abandon them. The IDO/IEO culture has resulted in thousands of fund raises for just copy cat projects that dont have any viable future. Many of the swaps and DEX we have now wont be around in just 2 years from now. The tokens associated with them will be worth nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, some of the promising alts will be available for dirt cheap prices during the bear market and have a chance of gaining back their ATHs, but for most other projects the fall to earth is going to be more or less permanent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
