My dad has invested in the stock market for centuries so of course my proud ass went to him “I made 5% profits today”. \n\nHe started being quite mad and couldn’t understand I was that dumb to buy into this big scam. But after some talking and explaining he decided that “ok get me in too”. He gave me a chunk of money and told me to buy the best internet coins I knew. I began reading about crypto 24 hours straight for 2 whole days because you can bet your ass I was going to impress the sh*t out of him.\n\nAfter long research I decided on ADA, ATOM, ETH, XLM and BTC. I told him about every one of them and why I choose them and he seemed genuinely interested. In the first week our portfolio did +21%. Safe to say he was very impressed.\n\nEveryday since we’ve been talking crypto daily and I don’t think I’ve ever talked this much to my dad. Today our portfolio is up a total 104% in just over a month which is better than anything he’s ever done. He is very proud and I’m very happy that he is.\n\nThank you to all of you guys who’ve helped me pick the coins and getting started. You probably don’t know it but you’ve helped me so much.\n\nThank you all, god bless you :)",
