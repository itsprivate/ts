Full disclaimer, I have $100 bag worth of each of the following coins, but I really do believe that they have potential to make you/me some good returns. I will keep it short, so do not consider this as DD, it is more of a summary that I would mention to a friend.</p>\n\n<p>First one is:</p>\n\n<p>QANplatform $QANX: It is a quantum resistant blockchain that is developer friendly (you can program in any language), easy to migrate to, supports Solidity code as QANplatform is fully Ethereum EVM compatible. But it also supports building Smart contracts, Dapps, Defi, NFTs and other cryptocurrencies on the top of the Qan network. Their test net launched recently and their market cap is still small, around $60 Mil.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gspetwdcyiz71.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=445e91b8736b600d5ad7eb02f9ade69b7e2458bc\">https://preview.redd.it/gspetwdcyiz71.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=445e91b8736b600d5ad7eb02f9ade69b7e2458bc</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w6snnlhfyiz71.png?width=1553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eec2380302f60a7e293779b44646e0e003ecaab\">https://preview.redd.it/w6snnlhfyiz71.png?width=1553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eec2380302f60a7e293779b44646e0e003ecaab</a></p>\n\n<p>This is how the token is used</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ek1svpviyiz71.png?width=1514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a332d1f314418bbc986e21a143a5ebf8352fb8f\">https://preview.redd.it/ek1svpviyiz71.png?width=1514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a332d1f314418bbc986e21a143a5ebf8352fb8f</a></p>\n\n<p>And they are not on a big CEX yet, so this also might bring some good cash flow into it:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7uwhymwmyiz71.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dee6099c32243735448aeb8fb19dd0e55b2c1c6c\">https://preview.redd.it/7uwhymwmyiz71.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dee6099c32243735448aeb8fb19dd0e55b2c1c6c</a></p>\n\n<p>The only thing I personally view as a negative thing on Qan is the amount of coins the team has. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ebu8wjytyiz71.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cf1e7f39a54bcc199081f3e899146ff9ecfcce5\">https://preview.redd.it/ebu8wjytyiz71.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cf1e7f39a54bcc199081f3e899146ff9ecfcce5</a></p>\n\n<p>One final note, the APY for the staking was +%60 last two rounds but I have missed them both. Again, I only have $100 worth of Qan. Be careful to buy it on the BSC network and not on ETH due to the gas fees if you want to buy it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then, there is Ponyo-Inu $PONYO:</strong> Let me make this clear, <strong>IT IS A MEME COIN. I repeat, a MEME COIN.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, many meme coins can go big, but I&#39;m not saying this one will, again I only have $100 worth of Ponyo. Why I believe it has potential is because it is still relatively new (it launched two weeks ago), team incentivizes people to buy by doing raffles, and most importantly, it has an auto-impact mechanism (this means that a percentage of the transactions cost gets donated to a charity, this has exceeded $500K already). Two last things, the team is going ham on the marketing (was featured on the YT channel of Altcoin Daily which has +1M subscribers and on tons of twitter accounts), and it will go on a centralized exchange tomorrow:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3qajdz020jz71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d00f8749fb2d84314717d4f500568d6e078aba\">https://preview.redd.it/3qajdz020jz71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d00f8749fb2d84314717d4f500568d6e078aba</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d8f3mw8e0jz71.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821f494ab906c7520776c239d25e03dbfc01f177\">https://preview.redd.it/d8f3mw8e0jz71.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821f494ab906c7520776c239d25e03dbfc01f177</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Please, before attacking me or the content of the post, be reminded that I never claimed for this to be a DD, I have very low exposure in both coins, I am only sharing this with you guys because I want you to also benefit from the coincidence of me stumbling of these coins.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
