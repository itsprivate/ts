At the time, I couldn't imagine how to get out of this situation and decided to go all in into crypto.\n\nThanks to A LOT OF WORK obviously, a few successful trades, airdrops and especially the daily reading of the Reddit forums (which made me keep hope in the Long Winter), I managed to settle the last debt a few weeks ago.\n\nI was inspired by the post from the guy who became a millionaire thanks to crypto, and I'd like to celebrate this little victory with you too!\n\nNow it's time to start accumulating again! Once more, thank you!\n\n—\n\nEDIT: Some updates answering most asked questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Yeah, I paid the taxes.\n2. About jumping out in a bull market:\n\nI know, but I couldn't wait any longer... the bank I owed wouldn't open a checking account that became necessary because of a business contract. I have 2 employees depending on this contract. =\\]\n\n3. Some highlights of these 3 years:\n\nPlease, this is not a financial advice.\n\nI started reading a lot about BTC and other top10 coins. Invested in some alts because, for me back in 2017, BTC was also too high at 10-20k.\n\nSo, I picked up coins with a good product/idea and company/team behind it. Examples are: IOTA, XRP (at least in my first readings), XMR. Because I joined in quite early, I didn't lose money with XRP, for example, but I did with IOTA (because of the timing).\n\nIn the bear market, I put some money in BTC as well -- monthly, yeah. Then, started to look for microcap projects, such as BOMB, Parachute token, Uptrennd, XIO etc. Making part of these microcap communities is a good way to make some extra and know some good people. Of course, be very aware of scams.\n\nToday, I wish I could have done some things different:\n\n1. Don't fall in love with an asset (and sell or exchange them for profit);\n2. Bitcoin is the most resillient coin around, so it would be much less stressful if I had more BTC instead of alts;\n3. Don't be too greedy and profit all over the bullrun;\n4. DCA is the best strategy, as most of you pointed out;\n5. Don't hodl when the bear market starts (these were the longest 3 years in my life lol). I would sell everything back in Q1 2018 to return months or years later.\n\nThanks for your kind words. And yes,  this is why we crypto!",
