To honor his innovative spirit, Stan&amp;#39;s 1st Indian hero, Chakra The Invincible, debuts in his own NFT (digital art) collection from 7:30pm PT 12/27-12pm PT 12/29!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The website is even worse &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honoring what would have been Stan Lee’s 99th birthday on December 28th, we are inviting all of Stan’s fans to celebrate his amazing legacy with us by sharing ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is making money off him Honoring his legacy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate to see Stan Lee being used to shill something. I mean the person is dead , they just can&amp;#39;t let the man rest in peace. Stan Lee was my idol when I was younger and seeing this company take advantage of his name and creations is heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
