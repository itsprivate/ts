When I flew from Georgia to Lithuania I started my flight with Bitcoin at $52,000 and landed with it at $47,000. I flew back to the United States in early December and Bitcoin dropped again on my first flight. I made a post predicting Bitcoin would drop on my next flight and posted it as the 27th. Well my flight got delayed and Bitcoin again dropped significantly while I was on my international flight. I think this means my flights are a better indicator of the price in Bitcoin than PlanB’s predictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rghqzf/mildly_interesting_my_last_two_flights_have/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/H7avHlA\"&gt;new flight proof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
