Googling crypto brings a heaping pile of FUD, rando price predictions, and mommy-blog style opinion pieces that don&#39;t do anything to educate you. Wikipedia only gives about a kindergarten level of education. And it seems like everyone who&#39;s interested in informing you is just inviting you into their echo-chamber of shameless shilling.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an example, let&#39;s say someone says ADA is overhyped, it has no live projects that and I shouldn&#39;t buy it. \nI would like to know:\nWhere do I go see what ADA has planned?\nHow scalable is ADA? \nHow do I educate myself on marketcap and see for myself if it&#39;s overhyped? \nWhat advantages does ADA have over ETH and vice versa? \nWhat else might I be missing?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I&#39;d google each question individually, then struggle to find articles that answer my question, then try to assess which sources are trustworthy. But this takes literal hours of time I don&#39;t have. Is there any other way to find more concentrated trustworthy information?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m tired of sifting through nonsense hype and endless FUD. Would appreciate any recommendations!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
