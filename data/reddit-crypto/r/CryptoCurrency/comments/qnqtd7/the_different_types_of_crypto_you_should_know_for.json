This data can also be pulled from the real world, like a program grabbing the real time price of eth to usd when you need to cash out or pay for something.</em> </li>\n<li><strong>Payment Method Cryptocurrency</strong> - These are Cryptos created to replace the conventional ways of payment and transactions we usually have, these currencies have very fast transaction speeds and incredibly small to no transaction fee. Included in this category are Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dashcoin.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Coins</strong> - Coins meant to be as anonymous as possible, while it&#39;s easy to track who could possibly be holding the coin if you&#39;re using an exchange with KYC, if you move it off exchange it will be harder to trace. (Monero, Zcash.)</li>\n<li><strong>Memecoins</strong> - Coins with little-no functionality often minted purely relying on speculation and Hype to achieve gains in the crypto space.
