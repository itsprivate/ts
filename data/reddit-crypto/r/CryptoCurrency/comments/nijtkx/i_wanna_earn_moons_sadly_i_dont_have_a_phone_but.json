Recently, I found out that I could earn moons in this forum. Sadly, there's no vault in my reddit app. I found out that it's because I'm using a tablet and the vault is only available in the smartphone app.\n\nUPDATE: Someone said that s/he opened the vault in a tablet. This means that vault isn't supported only in old devices like mine. My Samsung Tab A device was released in March 2016. The vault and user's number of moons are both hidden.\n\nCONTINUATION:\n\nI don't have a smartphone because I gave it to my sister whose phone got damaged in 2018. Since then, I only have a tablet which also functions as my phone. It might sound weird for others because I'm using it as a phone. But it's only small so no problem to even bring it outside. It's a 7 inch Samsung Tab A 2016 worth $160 which I've been using for 3 years. Because my priority is paying expenses, I've been stopping myself from buying a new phone for 3 years. After all, it's not really essential because my tablet is still fine.\n\nRight now, I can't afford to buy a phone because there are other things which I need to prioritize first. Also, I don't get paid $150 from my previous earning site so I don't have additional money. \n\nFortunately, I found a way to use the vault and earn moons. I asked a family member to let me activate the vault and borrow her phone sometimes so I can post here. For example, I made this post on her phone.\n\nBy the way, I'm curious. After activating the vault on the device which I borrowed, is it still possible to earn moon if I post contents in my own device without vault support? If this would work, I don't need to borrow phone except during cash out and also I could avoid buying a new phone to save money.\n\nI hope my solution works. What do you think? Would it work? Thanks for reading this post. Also, I appreciate your opinion. Good day and night.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nTo the 17% downvoters:  It's okay. ☺️\n\nTo the 83% upvoters: \n\nThanks a lot for your upvote. ☺️ There's a lot of good people here especially in the comment section. They're really kind. Thanks for being a good person.👏👏 Also, thanks to the 4 people who gave me moons.",
