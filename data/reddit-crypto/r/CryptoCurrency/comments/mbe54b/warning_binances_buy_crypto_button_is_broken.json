This is a warning to those of you who may have used the \"Buy Crypto\" button on [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) \n\nI attempted to make a purchase last night using the \"Buy Crypto\" button because it seemed easy. It returned an error four times with a red X that said \"Error, please try again\". On the fifth attempt, I was brought to the confirmation page. I went to my email to check the success and lo and behold I had received five success emails, costing me $1750 when I received a confirmation for a single purchase. I reached out to Binance and was auto-filed as a \"Bug Report\" and I received the automated message. I then made a post to the Binance subreddit and received a response from a Binance US employee pretty quickly. I gave him my ticket number and received this as a reply to my ticket:\n\n> Hi-  \n  \n>  \n>We're sorry, fixes for that have been in the works.   \nThe only solution I have for now is to withdraw the extra USD when the deposit limit time is up. I'll double check if there is any other possible solution here. \n\nSo, Binance is actually *well aware* that the \"Buy Crypto\" button can \"accidentally\" charge people when it says it didn't work. There's no warning. There's no \"this might actually spend your money when it says it didn't\" message. In fact, if it weren't for me checking my email immediately, I could be sitting on thousands of dollars worth of crypto and have *no idea*. If the price goes up, well that's great, but if it goes down? Well, you just lost a bunch of money and guess what, you ***still can't withdraw it*** until the withdrawal lock is lifted.\n\nI can foot this bill, but I'm a little peeved that Binance *knows* about this and still just lets people fall victim to it. That seems like it should be illegal, no?",
