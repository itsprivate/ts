SDF also signed an anchor agreement with ​Stably​, a US-based asset tokenization platform, to enable easy on and off ramps for USDC​ as well as their own USD stablecoin in Q1 2021.\n\nFor those who aren’t aware, Unionbank is one of the [top 10 largest banks in the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks_in_the_Philippines)\n\nThe Philippines (35.2 billions) is also among the top 5 countries that hold the largest remittances transactions. \n\nFurthermore, majority of Filipinos do a lot of transactions online through digital wallets like Perahub, Coins.ph(another anchor on Stellar Network providing Philippine Peso Stablecoin), and Gcash.\n\n**More great news:**\n\nIn Q4 of 2020, the issuance of four new stablecoins were announced to the Stellar network.\n\n● Argentine Peso (ARST) and Brazilian Real (BRLT), issued by ​Settle Network​: The first stablecoins for Argentina and Brazil went live in November of 2020. Both are fully-backed by domestic currencies and preserve close 1:1 rate between them and local currencies, involving bank grade KYC verification, AML controls and blockchain monitoring.\n\n● Euro (EURB), issued by ​Bitbond​ and ​Bankhaus von der Heydt​: In December 2020, Bitbond and Bankhaus von der Heydt (BVDH) announced the first stablecoin issued directly by a banking institution on Stellar and one of the first of its kind in the crypto market. The Euro (EUR) stablecoin (EURB) is ​live​ and available today on the Stellar network.\n\n● US Dollar (USDC), issued by ​Circle​: The Centre Consortium announced Stellar as an official chain for USDC, one of the world’s leading compliant and regulated digital dollar stablecoins. It is expected to be live in Q1 of 2021.\n\nTLDR: Stellar is being used in real life by moving money from Singaporean Dollar to Philippine Peso. More stablecoins are added to Stellar including Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, and Euro while USDC is expected to come to Stellar this Feb 2021. \n\nIf you want to buy XLM, download Lobstr or Solar(non-custodial) or Anchorusd(custodial you earn interest on your XLM) and Coinbase.\n\nYou can also do it via exchange like Binance, Kraken etc.",
