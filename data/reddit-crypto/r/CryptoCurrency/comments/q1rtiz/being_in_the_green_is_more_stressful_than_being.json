Yes I&#39;d like to buy a house or a flat at some point in my life and I&#39;m very very far from there right now BUT I won&#39;t empty everything as soon as I have enough for a house. This would be counter productive.   </p>\n\n<p>When I&#39;m in the red the solution is easy. Buy, buy, buy so you can average down. Nowadays the feeling of buying is different because I&#39;m buying while already in the profits.   </p>\n\n<p>The only solution I found is to think I&#39;m averaging up so that at the next dip I can really average down but it doesn&#39;t make much sense. This is why people blindly dca&#39;ing have a better time. The decision making is very complicated. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What is for you, the most complicated time in the markets???</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
