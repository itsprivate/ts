My biggest bags are up 3.5% and 3.4% in the past hour. I might sacrifice another hundred or so to make my big bags go even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Update aprox 4 hours in: started from $143 down to $99.93. I apologize to anyone getting rekt. But it had to be done. I&#39;m riding this bitch down to $0.000000000000000000.</p>\n\n<p>Update aprox 7 hours in: Currently sitting at $103.97 from my $143 starting point. I will continue to update until the 24 hour mark. If somehow my first offering to the crypto gods wasn&#39;t enough to tank it hard enough by then, i shall sacrifice $57 tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Update aprox 9 hours in: The blood bath continues. The gods must be pleased with my sacrifice. From $143 to $89.38.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
