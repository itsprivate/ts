If you have over $10k on an exchange or any amount you can't afford to lose, do ALL of these steps. To be honest, all of this is just the bare minimum. I've been trading and using cryptocurrency since 2017, I work in IT and have taken classes in cybersecurity. I am nowhere near an expert but I feel that I know a lot about this. Feel free to add anything I missed below.\n\n# How to not get hacked:\n\n**1. Have a strong unique password, don't keep it out in the open.**\n\n\\-More than 16 characters, containing numbers, symbols, and capitals.\n\n\\-If you use a password manager, secure it as well. I recommend Bitwarden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Have google authenticator as your 2FA.**\n\n\\-Store your backup seed on a thumb drive or on paper in a secure location (in case your phone gets lost). DON'T STORE IT ANYWHERE ELSE.\n\n\\-Don't use your phone number, and don't use Authy. It can be hacked if someone swaps your sim card.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Secure your email with a strong password and 2FA (google auth) as well.**\n\n\\-Use all these rules for it too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Have a separate email that you use for only crypto and banking.**\n\n\\-One for everything else.\n\n\\-If your info gets leaked in a data breach for Facebook for instance, the email you used for it is known to hackers but the one you use for your exchange is not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Install Phishfort on your browser.**\n\n\\-It will help protect you against fake websites that steal your info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. Use anti-virus software on  your pc and scan your phone for malicious apps.**\n\n\\-Do a quick scan at least once a week and a full scan once a month.\n\n\\-Malwarebytes has a great free virus scan but it does not run automatically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. Do not give your password or any code sent to your device to ANYONE.**\n\n\\-No one from the exchange will ask you for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, hope this valuable info serves you well.",
