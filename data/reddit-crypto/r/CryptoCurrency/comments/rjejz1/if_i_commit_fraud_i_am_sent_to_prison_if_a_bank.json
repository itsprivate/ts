No jail time, no public apology, no court hearing and certainly no punishment as that is a drop in the ocean compared to their annual revenues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan was also just fined $200M for illegally conducting official business via end to end encrypted apps thus evading audits and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now as an average citizen, how am I chased to report every single dime I make and forced to meticulously track my measly Crypto portfolio? Is this fair and right? How can I accept any form of Crypto regulation by the powers at be when they can’t even abide by their own laws? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
