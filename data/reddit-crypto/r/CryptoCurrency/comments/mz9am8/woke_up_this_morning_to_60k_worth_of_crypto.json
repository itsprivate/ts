Overnight, someone withdrew 22 ETH worth over $60K (My life saving pretty much, I'm 27 and was aiming for a small apartment to live in)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wallet (Account 1) address [https://etherscan.io/address/0x374d51543db6c697eed85fe7fd9fa485201f34a9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x374d51543db6c697eed85fe7fd9fa485201f34a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems to end up on the an Exchange named FixedFloat, you can track the transfers and final deposit here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e5b2e1dc63f6b91cb6cd759936495434c7e972f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e5b2e1dc63f6b91cb6cd759936495434c7e972f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 4 days ago, I downloaded a software called LimitSwap to purchase  a new token the moment it is listed. This company is run buy a man who goes by the name Crypto Gnome. His trading software requires you to input your private key so it can execute trades. I asked about this in the telegram group and a bunch of people immediately reassured me this is normal, the bot only runs on my computer and needs the key to make trades. The developers would never have access to the key. \n My computer has never been compromised before, only in the few days since I inputted my key into his software. Basically the amount of people who claimed to be fellow customers reassuring me gained my trust. Looking back, this was incredibly gullible of me. [https://www.limitswap.com/](https://www.limitswap.com/) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5qWpyoWPMk&ab\\_channel=LimitSwap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5qWpyoWPMk&ab_channel=LimitSwap)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI contacted him but he his is not very helpful at all. He is accusing me of lying and never using his software, even though you can trace the token I had to buy to use his program named $LIMIT\n\nAny ideas how to proceed from here would be greatly appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone reading this, please go buy a cold wallet right now. Also never share your private key with anyone, even your grandmother. I was way too relaxed about my crypto and there are people at every corner with plans already hatched on how to steal your assets. Be careful out there don't trust anyone or any software claiming to need your private key.\n\nI made this from nothing so I guess I'll just have to start again. Not the end of the world but a very expensive lesson.",
