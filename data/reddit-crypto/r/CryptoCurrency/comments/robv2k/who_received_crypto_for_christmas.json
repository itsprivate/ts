I hope all are having a wonderful day with their family and/or friends and are ready to fill up on some delicious food. Hopefully everyone received something that you weren&amp;#39;t expecting, that made you happy as hell!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my brother $100 worth of Bitcoin to start him out. He was excited as hell, so that made my day. He decided to make an account last night when I told him to, and bought $200 more (I actually got it and sent it to him because his account wasn&amp;#39;t verified yet). I&amp;#39;m excited to see him on his journey! \nHas anyone  else bought crypto for family members or friends,  and if so, what was their reaction?\nWhich one gift made your day? I&amp;#39;d love to know. Mine was Jordan V golf shoes. \nOnce again,  everyone have a great day and hopefully see you on the moon next year!\nMerry Christmas to all and keep on hodling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
