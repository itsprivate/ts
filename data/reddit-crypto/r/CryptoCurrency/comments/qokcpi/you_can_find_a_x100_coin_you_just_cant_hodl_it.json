Let me tell you that is a completely false assumption. </p>\n\n<p>Investors of today miss one of the most important requirements in order to be a good investor : Patience. You see them complaining about their coin not moving for a whole week while others are pumping. Dear friends, do you realize what the fuck you are saying? Getting a 100x coin needs time and luck. </p>\n\n<p>In the stock market if you have doubled your investments in 10 years you are considered successful. Crypto is way more volatile so don&#39;t be greedy or you will end up day trading. When i started investing in crypto i made the same mistakes as you. I still do. But i have learned one thing. Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day. </p>\n\n<p>Now i haven&#39;t touched my portfolio for over a year. I have the king, some alts and a handful of micro cap gems i believe in. Guess what, some of them have x5. The old me would have sold way earlier. If i am lucky in a few years i will be able to see a x100 who knows! </p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story : **Grow some fucking patience.**</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
