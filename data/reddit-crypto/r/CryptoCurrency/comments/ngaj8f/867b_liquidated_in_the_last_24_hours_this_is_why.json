After $8.67B in leveraged long positions getting wiped out the majority of those with leveraged positions are now short.  So if there is a bounce back from here expect countless billions more to be liquidated.  Liquidated on the way down, liquidated on the way up.  The liquidations just never end.  No matter how much wealth is incinerated people still line up to put down more.</p>\n\n<p>95% of traders lose money.  Leverage just ups those odds but I guess every noob thinks they are the wolf of satoshi street and will be the 5% to turn $100 into a lambo in three weeks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
