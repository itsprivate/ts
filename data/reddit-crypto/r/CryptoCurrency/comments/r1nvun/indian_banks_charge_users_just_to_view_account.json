There is no universe where it costs money to query a centralised database. They aren&#39;t sending someone to an office to fetch the records dammit, it&#39;s all on a fucking computer. </p>\n\n<p>Indian banks have atrocious charges that rip people off - from minimum balance charge, to cash withdrawal charge to check clearance charge.  </p>\n\n<p>But because these scam policies by archaic bank institutions is threatened by crypto&#39;s emergence, the central bank that allows these scams to take place is lobbying to have crypto itself prohibited, so that these shady banks can continue conning users. This is the real pyramid scheme - sucking in new unsuspecting users and charging them for every single action while holding their funds hostage.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
