  "selftext": "Dear fellow crypto enthusiasts,\n\nSurely you have noticed the XRP pump&dump that took place two days ago. I am posting this as someone who completely fell for it. I hope that by sharing my experience I may gain some resolution and prevent someone else from doing the same mistake.\n\nI am relatively new to crypto and went in way over my head. My strategy was to take most of my savings and put it on bitcoin for 5-7 years. Originally, I used €45k or $54k.\n\nI went in when BTC was a little over 20k. But when it dipped to 30k, I threw my own strategy out the window and thought that I could time the market. As I lacked strategy and patience, it resulted in a loss that brought me down from 2 BTC down to 1.55 BTC. This was a lesson for me, which I should have paid more attention to.\n\nThen on the first of February the XRP pump happened, so follow me for this ride (time in UTC):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be5aztpfq9f61.jpg?width=1486&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6a433c4bee9b5dda80294d6cd09865051722f3b\n\n1. **(05:00)** Early in the morning, I notice the rise of XRP, because it was promoted in various subreddits. A huge rise was promised because of some arbitrary reason (ripple filed its defence towards the SEC).\n2. **(08:54) Buy order:** At this point, I thought it was a good idea to switch about 50% of my BTC (0.77) into XRP.\n3. **(10:37)** **Sell order:** It started to work. It went up and I sold it for 0.787 BTC. This small profit made me even more reckless.\n4. **(10:44) Buy order:** I saw a larger dip, which happened before on XRPs way up. I thought that this was a good spot to get in again. My goal was now to swing back to 2 BTC to remake my loss. A huge gambling red flag – as I learned later.\n5. **(11:14) Buy order:** It’s up again! I thought that I should accelerate the gain by moving the rest of my BTC (0.78) into XRP. I am almost there! Somewhere I read that there was a huge pump incoming at 14:30. I was adamant about holding until then.\n6. **(12:14) Sell order:** I didn’t realize what has happened, but now there was an even bigger dip. I panicked and sold, but I am now down to 1.157 BTC.\n7. **(12:15) Buy order:** Another irrational decision, as I thought that this surely must be the recovery. So I went all-in again.\n8. **(13:33) Sell order:** Another panic sell. Now I only get 0.9 BTC.\n9. **(13:36) Buy order:** I thought that the loss is unacceptable and that this must be the recovery before the big pump! I go all-in into XRP again.\n10. **(17:11) Sell order:** My final sell order. I am now down to 0.66 BTC and finally realizing that I got scammed and that I was left holding the bag.\n\nHere is my transaction history from Bitstamp:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xdefuznhq9f61.gif\n\nMy worst mistakes besides not sticking to my HODL strategy were that I invested more than I could afford to lose, that I did not accept the losses, and that I fell for the obvious pump&dump signs:\n\n* The many posts that were advocating the XRP recovery.\n* The speed as XRP gained significant volume over the course of a few hours.\n* The rumour of a huge pump on a specific time.\n\nNow there is a great guide out there on pump&dump schemes by u/Anhowa123 that I wish I had known earlier:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4zsv/with\\_the\\_recent\\_influx\\_of\\_new\\_users\\_i\\_decided\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4zsv/with_the_recent_influx_of_new_users_i_decided_to/)\n\nApparently, everything was organized via a telegram group. I lost about €25k or 0.9 BTC in the pump&dump. This is more than I can take to lose. Since then, I am devasted. I am feeling physically sick and stressed. I can barely eat, and I am too ashamed to tell anyone in person what I have done.\n\nThe worst part is that I have invested money that I inherited from my grandmother, who worked hard for this. I feel that I have let her down and I do not know what to do anymore. It would take me many years to earn it back.\n\nPlease don’t make the mistakes that I did.",
