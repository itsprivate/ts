But from time to time I do like to put a few bucks into some lesser-known projects, you know, hidden gems, best-kept secrets, etc. I did realize that every time I do an assessment if it&#39;s not completely moronic to invest in a particular project/coin, I am coming back and forth so many times, because I am forgetting what it is, what&#39;s the max supply, etc. That led me to make my own excel chart with Top 500 in which I filtered all the stuff that didn&#39;t pass my check. So I decided to share that with you and save you some tenths or hundreds of clicks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So how did I filter the top 400-500? I removed all this:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>no meme coins and also coins with HODL, SAFE, MOON etc in their name</li>\n<li>no stablecoins, no wrapped coins, no exchange related coins</li>\n<li>no coins where I couldn&#39;t find any decent info about the team behind them</li>\n<li>no coins where top 10 holders own more than 90% of the total circulating supply</li>\n<li>no coins where I couldn&#39;t verify how much top 10 holders own</li>\n<li>no NFT&#39;s, collectibles etc</li>\n<li>no projects without a working website</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For me, all that above are <strong>RED FLAGS</strong>. I did not evaluate if the coins/projects have their own apps, wallets, audit, mainnet etc, because some of them are X years old and some of them are 2021, so that wouldn&#39;t be fair. I would personally remove even those projects that are more than 90% low than their ATH considering them walking dead, but left them there for you. I would stay away from those zombies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE REMAINING 29</strong></p>\n\n<p>(positions of course changed a bit since this morning)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v3gxkdx4xdf71.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f1df68e4da48ec13917d4efb942b042065b9a54\">https://preview.redd.it/v3gxkdx4xdf71.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f1df68e4da48ec13917d4efb942b042065b9a54</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Numbers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>(of course, the price is not live, but I left it here to have some approx, sorted by position)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rus3v47axdf71.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a642c58414c6e51f9977ca7d7e08ad0de3c09993\">https://preview.redd.it/rus3v47axdf71.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a642c58414c6e51f9977ca7d7e08ad0de3c09993</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Age of the project and exchange listing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Yes</em> means that the project is listed on at least one of these exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2ad3ilj6xdf71.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb408ac1ef12d32b0fd4cd01412b4d7490039cd5\">https://preview.redd.it/2ad3ilj6xdf71.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb408ac1ef12d32b0fd4cd01412b4d7490039cd5</a></p>\n\n<p>PS: of course, I am just a dumbass who doesn&#39;t understand money, so this is not advice at all. Just top 500 trimmed down. Maybe your criteria are completely different and in that case, this is useless for you, but I believe there are many people here who can save some time with this.</p>\n\n<p>PS2: I am tired.</p>\n\n<p>PS3: if you want, I could do the same with the top 300-400. I guess I will just wait to see what will be the response.</p>\n\n<p>PS4: of course, this is what I filtered. That doesn&#39;t equal being a good project or a great investment opportunity. DYOR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
