How the hell is this allowed?</p>\n\n<p>And the worst part is that all of these comments had HUNDREDS of upvotes. Anyone who even slightly believes this is not just delusional, they are entirely insane and have absolutely no knowledge about financial fundamentals.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, this has nothing to do with crypto. Pointing out that BTC is tied to the USD right now which makes the crypto market almost identical with the stock market is one thing and of course, it&#39;s welcomed to discuss. But seeing GME and AMC shilling posts with 3k upvotes, 30 award on the front page is ridiculous and I just can&#39;t imagine how the hell it is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>I have already been thinking about leaving the sub because it&#39;s in a ridiculous state. Downvoting hordes, moon farming bots and gif spamming threads, but this is just getting insanely ridiculous. I can&#39;t comment or post anything on this sub, because it&#39;s instantly downvoted, doesn&#39;t matter what it is and those bots or users are then going through my profile and starts to downvote other things too, that&#39;s why I have everything hidden. And it&#39;s not just me, but all these complaining is basically deleted from here, so I expect this post to be downvoted or deleted too.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve made quite a few technical posts a month and two ago about PosT, tokenomics, fundamentals and so on, they were all well researched and technical and none of them got more than 20 upvotes... but they all had &lt;50% upvote rates with 60-70 comments with mostly positive feedback and discussion. This sub is a pathetic moon farming WSB copying hive mind and it has NOTHING to do with crypto anymore.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Sorry not sorry for the rant. I can&#39;t wait for bear market to all these &quot;people&quot; will disappear here and finally we can discuss tech and market again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
