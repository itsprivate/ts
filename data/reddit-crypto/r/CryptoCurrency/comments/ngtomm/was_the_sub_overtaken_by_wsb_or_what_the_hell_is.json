Downvoting hordes, moon farming bots and gif spamming threads, but this is just getting insanely ridiculous. I can't comment or post anything on this sub, because it's instantly downvoted, doesn't matter what it is and those bots or users are then going through my profile and starts to downvote other things too, that's why I have everything hidden.

This sub is a pathetic moon farming WSB copying hive mind and it has NOTHING to do with crypto anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry not sorry for the rant.
