I started with nothing but a normal source of income and I didn&#39;t strike lucky on a megapump or anything like that. Just steady profit taking and a simple rule I <em>never</em> break.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If anyone wants to play the long game, here&#39;s how I play it</strong> (initially shared in comments, then people asked me to share it)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I sell 20% of my bag after 40% profit, as a hard rule. Then I DCA back in during dips and bear markets using my main source of income and post-tax staking rewards. Works reliably every time. It&#39;s worth rewriting that as &quot;taking profit, but still with 80% of the portfolio intact&quot;</li>\n<li>The 40% profit level is usually hit 2-3 times during bull runs, but sometimes only 1. Profits end up in a composite index fund, and I prepay taxes.</li>\n<li>I&#39;m fairly diversified (around 30 coins), with a mix of oldcoins, solid midcap projects and a few microcaps. I do a lot of research and immerse myself into the communities of most of these coins. If something starts to smell bad, I sell immediately.</li>\n<li>I stake whenever I can, some coins are up to 20% APY <em>without lockup</em>. This is now a significant stream of passive income.</li>\n<li>I completely ignore fads and shitcoins. Just solid projects with a good plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Key takeaways: I make no attempt to time the market, and &quot;hodling&quot; across bull runs is <em>not</em> effective.</p>\n\n<p>This is a powerful strategy, because you get to have a crypto exposure, yet benefit from the magic of compound interest in fiat.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
