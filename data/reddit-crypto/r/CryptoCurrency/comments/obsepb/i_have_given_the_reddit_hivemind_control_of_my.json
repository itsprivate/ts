It broke even for now. </p>\n\n<p>If anything, I&#39;m surprised of the overall sentiment and quality of post: No DOGE, SIHBA or other shitcoins were picked, good job reddit :)</p>\n\n<p>The bot analyses the top 10 posts in hot, and checks for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap. If there&#39;s a match with positive sentiment in any of the posts, the bot will buy.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll keep this running for the next week or so and will keep posting my results.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
