By luck the wallet had changed network or something. </p>\n\n<p>My solution was to find a wallet that had access to unrekt. I created a new wallet there and was able to capture the URL of unrekt. I than took out my SIM card and blacklisted everything on my router except for this very special URL. In this new wallet I imported the tokens I was going to need to transfer. </p>\n\n<p>I imported my hacked wallet and with the fastest fingers you’ve ever seen, I was able to run the dApp and got all the shit contracts off my BSC. From there, I sent all the assets to the other, new safe wallet. </p>\n\n<p>Yeah I lost a lot in taxes (about 10%) but here I am, relived and somewhat humbled. Ive learned my lesson to follow the contract and learned how to identify honey pots and rug pulls on the BSC. </p>\n\n<p>TL:DR : With some luck and clever work arounds, I was able to recover 90% of my wallet assets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
