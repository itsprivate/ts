You wouldn&#39;t tell people the size of your IRA either. <strong>So why would you tell anyone how much crypto you have?</strong> It is literally an asset that can be sent instantly and irreversibly to a criminal... with a knife to your throat.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto &quot;merch&quot; advertises to the world that you have some of the asset and almost certainly <strong><em>more of other crypto assets.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There are two reasons that I hear from people for why they have crypto swag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;I want to spread awareness&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The people who would buy a crypto after seeing it on a t-shirt are the wrong <del>idiots</del> people to get into crypto. They&#39;re going to call it a scam every time the price goes below their purchase price. Generally, if you do anything because a t-shirt says to... you&#39;re an idiot.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;I&#39;m proud of it and involved in the community and I want people to see that.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>People will either think you&#39;re a nerd.</p>\n\n<p>Or people will think you&#39;re rich.</p>\n\n<p>Do you really want the people who see you to think any combination of those things about you? Robbers see someone with a crypto t-shirt and probably think to themselves, &quot;This guy is a rich nerd; a perfect target for me.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - Your crypto &quot;merch&quot; makes you a target to all of the wrong people. Wear with caution if you do wear crypto merch at all. Don&#39;t advertise to the public that you hold <del>crypto</del> anything of value, whether by speech or &quot;logo.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
