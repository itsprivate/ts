I’ve had a hard time converting my friends to crypto due to the following statements.\n\n1. You “must” IMMEDIATELY transfer to cold storage or risk losing all your coins. \n\n2. “Do not order your Trezor / ledger from Amazon” because they might put software on that to hack it and steal your crypto. \n\n3. “Don’t use hot wallets” because they are also not secure, and will get hacked. \n\n4. “Do not use platforms like Blockfi and Celsius”\n\n5. “Do not buy crypto ETFS”\n\n6. Do not use any service that stores their crypto with Gemini cold storage. Even though it’s cold storage it cannot be trusted at all, unless it is your own cold storage, ordered directly from the manufacturer \n\nI get it. There are risks with not owning your crypto. Just like your bank account has a chance of getting hacked. And your car has a chance of getting broken into. Or someone could break into your house and steal your seed phrase. Or steal your identity and open accounts in your name. Or your house could burn down with your seed phrase inside. \n\nThe crypto community unfortunately makes it seem to newbies like there is a 100% chance of getting hacked on any platform you use, and you are an idiot if you leave anything for a second on anything besides a cold storage wallet. I actually delayed getting into crypto for a year because of this. then when I did I checked the exchange and Exodus every hour making sure nobody was stealing my coins, while I waited to receive my ledger in the mail.",
