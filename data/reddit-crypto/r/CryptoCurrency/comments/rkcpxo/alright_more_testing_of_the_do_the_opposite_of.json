People seem to like it, and it&amp;#39;s fast (due to centralization and ridiculously specific requirements for validator computers) so it may end up one of the many centralized projects that big money will absolutely love in the coming run up to BTC/ETH ATH. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I think this is wise? Hell no. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I think it&amp;#39;s fun? Yeah. The fun thing about finance is you make a prediction and then put your money where your opinion is. I think ICP might end up worth more than $22. That being said, it&amp;#39;s purely a bet. And so it&amp;#39;s a TINY bit of my portfolio. If I&amp;#39;m right, that tiny bit gets a bit bigger. If I&amp;#39;m wrong, well, it will be more fun than a scratch off. Wish me luck, or ill will!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
