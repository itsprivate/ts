But this raises the question, with the ever increasing number of users that are adopting crypto and the fact that one person can have many wallets and even the fact that there are groups such as the FBI dedicated to finding private keys of wallets, what are the chances that your private key could either be guessed or collide with a newly generated wallet with the same address?\n\nIn fact as crypto adoption grows and potentially replaces fiat currency entirely, there will be a number of people who'd definitely think about the prospect of becoming a digital treasure hunter. Just trying address after address until they got to an account with potentially thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of Bitcoin/ETH/etc.\n\nWhat if these people were to create a database of all the possible Bitcoin addresses and then just start to pull out money from all of them one by one? To explain why this wouldn't be possible, all of the world's computers combined today would provide about 2.3 zetabytes of storage according to some estimates. 1 yottabyte = 1000 zettabytes.

Here's an example of a private key which is 64 characters in the range of 0 - 9 and A - F: E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262, this private key doesn't exist for any crypto by the way I got it from an answer on Quora, there are 64 characters, and each character is hexadecimal meaning it can hold 16 different case insensitive values(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F), meaning there are 16^64 possible private key combinations. Now assume that the world population is 7.6 billion and everyone holds a wallet which adds up to 7.6 billion private keys, even in an imaginary best case the success rate of finding a correct private key is 100 multiplied by 7.6 billion divided by 16^64 which is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065634881018717779152936274157283036740481602769715738%.\n\nIn short I just wanted to show everyone how cool the Math behind cryptocurrency is and how while it may seem easy to imagine guessing a private key, it's a gargantuan task that not even the most powerful computers working together in the world today could think of pulling off and how unlikely it is to ever be possible. \n\nMy sources:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-for-someone-to-guess-a-private-key-to-a-Bitcoin-wallet-and-steal-the-coins\n\nhttps://medium.com/coinmonks/how-likely-is-it-that-someone-could-guess-your-bitcoin-private-key-6c0edd56fa1f\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZloHVKk7DHk\n\nFYI I posted this not too long ago and it didn’t gain much traction, I felt it would be apt to repost it now due to recent developments. \n\nTl;dr: it’s practically impossible to guess/crack someone else’s wallet address even for the FBI.",
