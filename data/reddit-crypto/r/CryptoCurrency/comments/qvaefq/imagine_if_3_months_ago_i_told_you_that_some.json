We all know that crypto is volatile, and you can&#39;t expect to make 10x in 1 year if you sell when you are 10% down in 1 day. \nThis bull run is far from over, just keep DCA and chill. Remember that 1 month ago Bitcoin wasn&#39;t even at $60k. Keep in mind that those who panic sell are not rewarded, don&#39;t let FUD or emotions control your investment choices.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: It&#39;s just a healthy price correction, chill.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
