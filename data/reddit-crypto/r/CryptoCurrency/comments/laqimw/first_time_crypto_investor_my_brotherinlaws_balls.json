I'm pretty convinced that's what he does when he's not working. His life is just eat, shit, work, gamble, drink, pass out.  There's really no science to this guy's life.   He's my age but looks double , but when he wants something he goes balls to the wall. \n\nHe always said crypto was stupid.   \n\nAnyway this guy calls me out of nowhere, says \"IM COMING OVER, I want you to show me how I can buy doge\". \n\nSure.   He comes by.  First thing this guy does is slap 2 grand in fresh 100s on the table next to me and tells me to buy doge for him.   \n\nNO PATIENCE AT ALL.  Like I have a stash of PKs on a hard drive waiting for him. \n\nI'm thinking most my shit is in wallets and I'm not parting with my shit coins either. \n\nSo going through the process of setting up his account, I was trying to explain to him coinbase, his account, transfers, binance. Before I could finish half of a sentence... He tells me. \"I don't have time for this, just buy it\".\n\nI bought Btc for him but there was a problem with his card. Only limited $1000 so we tried bincance.   Finally evil to get him to deposit 2000 I had to transfer BTC over for doge.   He said, \"I want you to sell it in 8 hrs whatever the price is and I'll be over tomorrow to pick up the money\"  \n\nI said.. woo wait a minute...you need to wait for the cash to transfer back to your bank account.    \n\n He starts fuming and says, \"NAH I can't wait, And I don't want BTC don't buy me that , there saying doge will hit $1\".   I told him I need btc from coinbase and he didn't understand. Just kept saying\" btc isn't going anywhere \"\n\nAnyway, I bought doge, sold in 8hrs when It was down 60%.  He calls me up afterwards all pissed and then tells me to keep whatever is in there that he wants nothing to do with crypto ever again.\n\n\nI don't understand how people like him make loads of money.",
