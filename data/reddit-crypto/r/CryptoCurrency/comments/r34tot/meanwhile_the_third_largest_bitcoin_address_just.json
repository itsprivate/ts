According to Bitinfocharts, the third largest Bitcoin address just bought another 991 BTC at an average price of $54,190.34 few hours ago.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/95sshkq962281.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4573674298deda0d32a02d82a548e67ff280112\">As seen on Bitinfocharts website, this address has just bought 991 BTC today, and has accumulated a lot of BTC in November 2021.</a></p>\n\n<p>This address now has <strong>114,959.56997991 BTC</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/icw6pf3l62281.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc2bb925d619c93419621f5c358bc8aedcf94dc7\">Balance as at 27 November 2021 as per Bitinfocharts website</a></p>\n\n<p>There is still dispute whether this address is a whale or an exchange, but this is a pretty good indicator of how the whales are reacting. So while many planktons are scared off, the whales are accumulating more Bitcoins than ever. </p>\n\n<p>Another interesting thing: This address ranked 81th in February 2019 but have now become the third largest address. Note the first two largest addresses are exchanges (Binance 1st, Bitfinex 2nd)</p>\n\n<p>DCA plus swim-with-the-whale strategy: DCA is the first choice for many small retail investors like us. But also time like this is the perfect opportunity to swim with the whales (of course not by leverage!). The whales move the market and I do think they do it to make even more profits.</p>\n\n<p>I have written a post last week about DCA strategy and the best one in my opinion is: regular DCA + set aside a fund to buy when the flash crash happens. See how the whales swim.</p>\n\n<p>This address has made 3,931,206,864.56 USD profit ever since. But even when we confine it to November, this address appears to time the market perfectly, it sold 1,500 BTC on 09 November 2021 when BTC hit $67,510.46.</p>\n\n<p>I put this into a spreadsheet:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rem6yxjra2281.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f6f045395295356e37a9360e0806f742cfbbab3\">Third largest Bitcoin address activities in November 2021 - summary</a></p>\n\n<p>So I think: DCA, don&#39;t panic, buy the dip like the whales do. The bull market is far from over. Technically we had always been in a bull market since 2010, thinking long term.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
