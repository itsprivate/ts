Last weeks proved it by massive drop in price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to biggest crypto to double it&amp;#39;s price and market cap just in 7 days. If you think it is possible you are not different than all those memecoins investors that are over optimistic. BTC should be about rationality and good example for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will BTC reach $100k? Easily but in few months,  not in a week. Don&amp;#39;t let dreams  control you. Not much will happen to BTC in next  week, better enjoy time with your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
