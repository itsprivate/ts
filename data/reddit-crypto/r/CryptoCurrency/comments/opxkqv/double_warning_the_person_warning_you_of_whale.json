You see, the whale showed you a zoomed in chart so you would dump your coins, leaving them cheap for whales to swoop in and take. <strong>THIS</strong> is the market manipulation they &quot;warned&quot; you about.</p>\n\n<p>What they didn&#39;t tell you about is the tried-and-true Half-Pipe Valuation strategy or HPV. Anyone that played even a minute of Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater knows that the real money is in the half-pipes. I&#39;ve rewired my GPUs to calculate the direction of the market and it produced the following chart:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/axf9tyhfcxc71.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d67966cfa702f1a3b37ddcc5fe670d148541f8\">Half-Pipe Valuation (HPV) strategy</a></p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the SUR pattern still holds and is even conservative by some estimates (my estimate). The original poster was not a whale at all but a dolphin trying to help. We owe them an apology.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
