We should be using that money to solve problems. You make profit from putting money towards something that grows and fills desires. We can pump random shit for now, but there’s no telling how short the joke will last. \n\nIt’s so cringe worthy cause all they have to do is buy top coins that aren’t pump and dump bs.
