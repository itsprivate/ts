A small panel of bipartisan members introduce an amendment that slightly improves the provisions (Wyden/Lummis/Toomey) but the amendment isn&#39;t quite enough to calm the mob. So they introduce an even worse amendment that scares the living sh*t out of all of you (Portman/Warner) so that all of you anchor your reference point to the first amendment from Wyden/Lummis/Toomey.  Notice how both amendments have members of both party? This is so neither party takes all of the flack and hatred from passing crypto regulations.</p>\n\n<p>NONE of the crypto provisions should be in the infrastructure bill PERIOD until we understand it better.
