Rocket emojis and memes being thrown everything. Stuff such as \n&quot;ETH to $10K ðŸš€ðŸš€&quot; and &quot;$250K BTC&quot; were being uttered every where. The only thing to hate on was dogecoin.</p>\n\n<p>Then let&#39;s rewind uptil a few days ago, the sentiment is COMPLETELY opposite. I&#39;m seeing people say &quot;crypto is done&quot; and that &quot;crypto is a scam&quot;, and posts like these being upvoted. People I&#39;ve never seen here before immediately start popping up to say how the tech behind crypto is useless and how crypto isn&#39;t a useful asset. Then all the bears come out of hiding and start saying it will be &quot;5-10 years&quot; before we reach our previous ATHs.</p>\n\n<p>Saying stuff like this would have been absolutely cruficied during the bull run. Heck, you could be slightly bearish and people would be laughing at you.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the <em>complete opposite</em> starts happening during a crash? People who say things will recover or that the crash is short-lived are being called &quot;delusional&quot; and told to &quot;cope&quot; or that they&#39;re high on &quot;hopium&quot;.\nAnd where were all the moon boys and pumpers? Real quiet. Most of them probably paperhanded and never returned.</p>\n\n<p>And now with a sign of recovery, they&#39;re back spamming the daily chat again. I was skeptical before, but now I&#39;m actually convinced being on this sub is useless and promotes unnecessary stress. Despite the hate a lot of the YT&#39;ers get, they&#39;re at least consistent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
