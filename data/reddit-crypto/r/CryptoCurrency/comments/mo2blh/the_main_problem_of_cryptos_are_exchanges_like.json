So we can't have cryptos without exchanges.\n\nAnd what are these exchanges? Let's talk about the biggest one: Binance.\nUntil you don't have any problem, everything seems to work fine.\nBut when you'll have a problem, you'll start to miss banks.\n\nI sent some crypto to my spot wallet on binance because I wanted to trade them. It was 10 days ago. I sent them and the transaction got confirmed 6 times in few seconds according to the blockchain.\n\nThese coins never arrived in my Binance wallet.\nI mean Binance got them but didn't put them in my account.\n\nWhy? Who knows? If it was a bank, I would just call them or pass by their offices and get my money. If they wouldn't give me, I would call the police.\n\nWith binance i had to talk to a stupid chat bot that said to write a message and that I would contacted back by email. Nobody ever contacted me back. I never got my money and I can do literally nothing because this is a ghost company.\n\nLuckily we're talking about few bucks but the problem is big. If you go in the binance reddit you'll see how many people have problems with them.\n\nHow cryptos can get adoption if we have to rely on these exchanges?",
