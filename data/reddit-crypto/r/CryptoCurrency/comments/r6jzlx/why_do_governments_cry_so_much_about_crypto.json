Considering what the Politicians, the SEC and the bankers say about Cryptocurrencies, it should be pretty clear that Cryptocurrencies hold NO value whatsoever. They consider it to be a worthless and useless asset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#39;s true, then why do people have to pay taxes on Crypto? People should not be paying any taxes for holding a useless asset. The same politicians and government bankers who call Crypto worthless receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from Crypto. It is clearly hypocritical to tax Cryptocurrencies and profit from it while calling it worthless at the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
