He is convinced, the USD will lose 99.9999% of value within a decade, that \"it'll take about a month to go from 3$ gallons of milk to 300k$ gallons of milk\", that \"EVERY SINGLE RESERVE CURRENCY EVER\" suddenly collapsed and that \"It happened already. I'm telling you the game is over, already, and you're in denial.\" He has 11k karma 30k moons and recently received gold.\n\nToday I saw [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9s76i/this_is_for_all_my_homies_who_spent_every_dollar/) with very rational trading advice: \"Every day right now, every waking second right now- you should be focused on buying crypto. Your entire life should be consumed of making money (fiat) to deposit into your bank account, so you can buy more crypto\". Looking at his account, I learned that COVID is not real, the moon landing was not real, and that vaccines cause autism. He has 32k karma and 4.2k moons.\n\nIf you are asking for advice here, especially if you're a newbie, please don't expect everyone to be an expert (or to be rational human beings), also not people who have been here for a while and have a lot of karma (seems obvious, but I think many people use karma as a proxy for how good a post probably is subconsciously). These are extreme examples, but many people who seem a bit more rational on here also can't wrap their hand around concepts like uncertainty and that stuff isn't guaranteed to go up. Please be suspicious of everyone, and it's a cliché by now, but: do your own research. Be safe!\n\nEdit: also see the comments by u/stonkgobrrrr [right in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9t7qm/people_on_here_seem_to_get_more_irrational_to/gxqoyg3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)",
