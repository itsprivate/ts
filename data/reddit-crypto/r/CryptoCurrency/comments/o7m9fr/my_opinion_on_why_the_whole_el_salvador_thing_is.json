Yeah some may say &quot;freedom from inflation, from USD, from the US manipulating the price&quot; yadda yadda. That might all be true. But there&#39;s another, rather concerning point I&#39;m seeing. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Removing privacy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is transparent. That&#39;s one of the big selling points. And normally that&#39;s a good thing. But if your wallet is linked to your Identity, let&#39;s say by a airdrop you have to claim by IDing yourself to prevent ppl from using the aidrop multiple times, transparency becomes a concern.</p>\n\n<p>Every transaction you do is public. Bought a car at a car dealer? Public. Bought some gold from a bank? Public. Bought something from dildopolis around the corner? Public. Bought something at a local supermarket? Public. For ever. (Of course it&#39;s not visible what you bought exactly).</p>\n\n<p>Some might say: Whatever. But remember: Companys are paying for that kind of data. They pay facebook  or companies like visa for you collected data. Because this data is normally more or less private.</p>\n\n<p>With the whole linking your wallet to your ID-thing the following is possible once you buy at <strong>any</strong> company with your wallet. Also the governement knows exactly where you bought, where you live, where you traveled, because every wallet can be linked to a shop with a physical adress. Everything is public. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know about you guys, but this sounds like an authoritarian nightmare. And while we critizised China for their digital yuan, we praise El Salvador because they are using BTC?? This is bullshit. This is dangerous.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
