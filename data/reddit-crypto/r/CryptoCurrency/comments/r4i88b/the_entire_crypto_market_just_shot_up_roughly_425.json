You can literally look at the charts (I use <a href=\"https://datamish.com\">datamish.com</a>) and see some extra weird shit as the price bounces quickly up and down then randomly every single coin will follow suit with a huge cliff down or a massive pump up.</p>\n\n<p>There are some huge warning signs in the global financial markets going on including the Chinese housing bubble and inflation. I&#39;m actually starting to get worried as a firm believer in crypto that this space is literally going to end up being controlled by the whims of billionaires using algorithms they know nothing about to hedge their coming losses and force the rest of us to foot the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Why else would literally every single large cap crypto rise almost the exact same percentage at once? I mean is everything just tied to the price of BTC at this point?</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t even mentioning that options contracts for the month expired this last Friday where likely billions of dollars were on the stake if prices stayed up. There&#39;s a clear coordinated effort to sway prices a certain way happening and barely anyone is actually talking about it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
