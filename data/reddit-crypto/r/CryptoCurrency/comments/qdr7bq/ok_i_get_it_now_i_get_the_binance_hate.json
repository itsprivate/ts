REALLY, Binance?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now I have to do Face verification. How about FUCKING NO??</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So, I calm down, OK, dude, you gotta do it. Just do it, transfer all of your little beer money funds, and let&#39;s go away from this manipulating crap of an exchange. Do the mobile thing, QR code, easy peasy. &quot;QC code invalid&quot;. Veins start coming out on my forehead, foam in the corner of the mouth, the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I used to like it. Cool basic site, everything working out, some minor headaches when shit goes down in all of crypto, but nothing substantial (since I don&#39;t do leverage).</p>\n\n<p>I get it now. I get all the hate. I was wrong. As soon as I figure out how to do the thing without giving my DNA to Binance to withdraw this little bit of portfolio I have there, I&#39;m bailing. And never coming back.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: go on, downvote away. Serial freakin&#39; downvoters, this just confirms my suspicions. Sketchy AF. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
