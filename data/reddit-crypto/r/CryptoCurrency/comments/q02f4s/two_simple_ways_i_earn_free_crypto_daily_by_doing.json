I mean, yes, it&#39;s a little bit at a time, but it adds up, and it&#39;s completely unnoticable to me, <strong>because i&#39;m not doing anything extra.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, how can you do it too?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Replace the default search (usually Google) on your computer AND smartphone with Presearch. You will get paid 0.1 PRE tokens per search, and up to 3 tokens per day. Currently the price of PRE tokens sits at $0.378. I&#39;ve accumulated hundreds of them. If you do 30 web searches per day (which I exceed), you&#39;ll get to 1000 tokens in under a year. Those 1000 tokens at the current price are worth $378. That&#39;s hundreds of dollars for doing what you do anyway. Now imagine the bull market continuing and that token potentially becoming worth $1 or more. Then imagine doing this over the next 4-5 years through a next bear market, accumulating 4000-5000 of them, and having them during the next bull run.</li>\n<li>Use Odysee. Odysee is a blockchain based YouTube alternative. Not only will you get paid LBRY credits for watching content (or publishing content), but I legitimately like the user experience of Odysee more than YT. While it&#39;s true there&#39;s currently not too many creators, I&#39;ve found quite a few channels that I was already subscribed to on YT. LBRY credits are currently worth $0.40. I don&#39;t know the exact formula for how they provide them, but I don&#39;t even care, as I like the service itself so much, and i&#39;ve accumulated quite a few of them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus points for doing the above is that you&#39;ll be using less Google&#39;s services, so less big tech, less censorship and more privacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perhaps most importantly, you&#39;ll become a true blockchain tech adopter, putting your actions where your mouth is. Someone who doesn&#39;t simply talk about &quot;the tech&quot;, but who actually USES the tech.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(I&#39;ll also add that I&#39;m Brave browser user (which allows to earn BAT tokens for watching ads),  but unfortunately there aren&#39;t many ads in my location so the income I receive from that isn&#39;t noticable. I hope it&#39;ll change though, and keep using Brave simply because it&#39;s an amazing browser).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I encourage readers to also share their ways I may not be aware of. Please provide it with a brief explanation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
