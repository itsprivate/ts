I basically got half a million for free. But there&#39;s a catch. These tokens can not actually be redeemed. They are scams.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at them and what they do</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minereum:</strong> This one is the first one i got (3 months ago). It exists on both ethereum and bsc.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of addresses received big amount of this coin that shows up to be thousands of dollars worth. But you can not actually spend these coins.</p>\n\n<p>They claim to be &quot;self mining smart contracts&quot;. You basically have to pay 0.30 BNB for level 2 or 0.90 BNB for level 3, and they will start &quot;mining&quot; and you&#39;ll get some dust worth cents. It is almost impossible to be able to get back the value of the BNB you paid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BestAir, Zepe, TheVera:</strong></p>\n\n<p>These ones are a simpler scam than minereum. You get some coins, and when you try to swap them on pancakeswap or some other dex the transaction won&#39;t go through.</p>\n\n<p>You will have to visit the token&#39;s website and it will ask you to approve a smart contract. By doing that you&#39;re giving access to your wallet to the attacker.</p>\n\n<p>If you do that your wallet gets drained and you lose whatever coins you have in it.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, be careful and don&#39;t get excited over these. And do not let the greed take over when you get airdropped a huge amount of money.</p>\n\n<p>Always do some research on random coins that you got before trying to do anything with them.</p>\n\n<p>A simple &#39;[token name] scam&#39; google search can save you a lot of money</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
