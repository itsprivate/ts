In other words: selling highs, buying lows. I will not share the details of any strategies here. </p>\n\n<p>But, here&#39;s what I learnt about the overall experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crypto is more predictable than it appears but only on a macro level. You cannot account for FUD, unforeseen news or black/white swan events - all of which can and will risk your entire portfolio.</li>\n<li>Trading is incredibly stressful. My mental health suffered and every aspect of my life took a hit. I grew obsessive. </li>\n<li>The FOMO is incredibly strong but patience is key if you&#39;re to make it out alive and in-profit. It was a constant battle between the two. There will always be another opportunity but it&#39;s hard to see that when there are large red/green candles in your face.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s time-consuming and a full-time job. I&#39;d keep an eye on charts 10h+ a day. </li>\n<li>It&#39;s addictive. You&#39;re always chasing that next trade.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do I regret it? <strong>No.</strong> Because (i) it worked for me (ii) I learnt a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Will I continue to do it? <strong>No</strong>. It&#39;s just not worth it. Health &gt; wealth. I&#39;ll be returning to DCA.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
