This does promote the idea that crypto is a great hedge. However, claiming this is hyperinflation is insane.</p>\n\n<p>Most experts will define hyperinflation as 25-50% price level increase in a MONTHLY basis. That&#39;s a minimum of 1,297% in a given year. Lets not spread fake information to spread fear in the system.</p>\n\n<p>So many posts are either pushing this montra and if theyre not, they send the whole &quot;if you kept cash in the last 12 years youd lose x but if you put it in BTC youd gain y&quot;. The false equivalencies are gross and are going to get people screwed when they think throwing everything into crypto will save them or make them rich.</p>\n\n<p>Let the downvotes begin</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: referenced it in the comments but to set the record straight, another common definition of hyperinflation is a 100% increase in price levels over a 3 year period. This doesnt disprove my statement but good to have all data in one place!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
