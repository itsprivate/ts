This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of “un-masking” or de-anonymizing them.*  \n\nAs a cryptocurrency user, you may boot up metamask one day and see an unrecognized token in your wallet. If you have ever posted your ETH / BSC / whatever crypto address anywhere on the internet, this will happen to you eventually. \n\nMost of the time it's just a shitcoin creator sending their funds to addresses they have scraped from the internet, in order to promote their worthless coin. **However,** it is entirely feasible someone is trying to de-anonymize you. The dust can be tracked through the blockchain until it hits an exchange or lands in a wallet you are trying to keep anonymous. \n\nEven if you are a small fish, it is inherently risky to swap or move tokens which you did not ask for.\n\nThe best course of action when you get dusted is to **never touch those funds, ever.** A good practice is to generate a new wallet address each time you accept crypto.
