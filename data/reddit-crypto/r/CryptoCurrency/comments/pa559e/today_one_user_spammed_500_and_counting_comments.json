What that limit is, or how it works I don&#39;t know, but we need something.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s more like:<br/>\nIF you comment in the daily 400 times, you are restricted in the following daily to 100 comments. </p>\n\n<p>What does everyone think? We have to do something, this is getting ridiculous. This user even replied to me saying:  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m new to crypto, I&#39;m just trying to learn.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the majority of the comments are a few words and have nothing to do with &quot;learning about crypto.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Mods, if you&#39;re listening, help!!!!!!!!!</p>\n\n<p>Rant over.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: this user is NOT a bot.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: most of the moons I earned are from when the ratio was 10 moons for 1 karma. To compare, I&#39;ve posted in today&#39;s daily 36 times.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
