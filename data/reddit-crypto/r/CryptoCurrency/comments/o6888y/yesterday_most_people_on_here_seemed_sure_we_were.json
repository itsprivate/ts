The only thing we know is that things went up like crazy for half a year, then crashed pretty hard in May and have been going sideways ever since. The market could continue to go sideways for months, or it could shoot back up or completely crash in an hour. Looking at former cycles doesn&#39;t help us all that much, nothing is guaranteed to repeat itself.</p>\n\n<p>This sub is a great source of entertainment and for crypto news, it is an awful source of advice. People like to pretend they know what will happen - and I think some really think they know it and are telling that to themselves - because they read it in the stars (and call it technical analysis) or just look at some metrics that support their claims and ignore others. Don&#39;t believe them, nobody knows anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr: nobody knows what will happen, don&#39;t believe anyone who pretends they do</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
