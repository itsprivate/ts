  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So today wasn&#39;t completely miserable. But that was probably because I spent a good portion of it unconscious. I took about 3 naps just to try to get the day over quicker. I guess it&#39;s kinda cheating, but I did manage to put off the first cigarette for a long time using the patented naps technique, and I&#39;m happy to take that as a win. Still have a few left, so I guess tomorrow will be the face-the-music day instead. Wouldn&#39;t that be something if I got down to my last cig and I just kept putting off smoking it forever? I like the idea of that.</p>\n\n<p>So I bought another $6.27 of btc today (0.00018532), which brings the total so far up to 0.00057061. Damn near a full bitcoin already! I probably won&#39;t mention specific numbers from now on just to be safe, but I am keeping track of each purchase including the price when I bought, and I&#39;ll make that into a spreadsheet for future generations to admire and save humanity with. I&#39;m really interested to see how things average out when the price has more movement. Lately with all this crab walking the price has been relatively close. I don&#39;t watch the charts much, I just go on once a day and buy at whatever the price is. We&#39;ll see how this pans out in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>So how did everybody else do? Still hanging on? What are you guys buying with your cigarette money?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
