Week 1 had me buying the One Ring to rule them all (LRC) and week 2 lead me to buying CRO. I am holding both and they are doing great. So my friends, what shall I add to the bags this week? I will make my buy at the magic hour of 420pm cst. I am not interested in the old Blue chip gang, I want something that&#39;s not a meme and has serious tech behind it. Help me get the Camry of my dreams.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1 I may reply with gifs as I have 2 addictions</p>\n\n<p>edit 2 my first HOT post-thanks y&#39;all. I will keep you in the loop about what i buy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
