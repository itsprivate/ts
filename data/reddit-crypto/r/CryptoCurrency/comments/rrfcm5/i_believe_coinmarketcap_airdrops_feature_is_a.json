Now I&amp;#39;m luckily not an idiot, so I created a new email just for crypto, with no information about my name or anything in the email address, created a FB account, telegram, a twitter account and installed trust wallet on an Android emulator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought why not earn some free crypto for something that takes me a minute to fill in daily, I can just do it while drinking my morning coffee. Oh boy what I was wrong. I participated in +300 airdrops, each with hundreds or even thousands as the number of winners, but never, not even once have I gotten a single thing, even though I filled in the information required and followed the steps they list every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it is statistically improbable that it is not a scam. I believe it is a way that projects use to gain followers and never actually follow up on the airdrops, I will stop participating in it and you should too, especially if you are giving them your REAL data. That will enable them to link your crypto address to your twitter, FB and telegram, so please stop giving that data away for a complete waste of time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
