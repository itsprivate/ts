Maybe the real strategy is just too chill out and invest in coins and projects you believe in longterm. I sometimes dont check my portfolio for a week and find it lost 10% in between and is now up 5% or the other way around. It all matters a whole lot less if you take a step back from time to time and just relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
