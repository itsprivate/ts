A very small group of people decide to PnD a coin.\n\n2. This group of people buy significant amounts of said coin, usually without moving the price too much.\n\n3. This group creates hype around the coin and convinces people that 'it will be the next to pump' or even give a specific time (which is one of the most ridiculous things to believe anyway).\n\n4. As the hype builds people try to ride the pump, buying at inflated prices.\n\n5. The same people who organised the PnD have already started selling their coins. The coins YOU are buying are them selling at the inflated price.\n\n6. By the time the coin hits the top, every single coin from every single person who organised it has been sold... to you.\n\n7. You're left with bags, desperately selling while the price tanks.\n\n8. Oh what's this? The price has started to climb again! This is due to other bag holders desperately creating hype so they can get out with smaller losses.\n\n9. Oh the price is dumping even harder now and you got greedy. You've now lost even more and not even to the original organisers. They're long gone.\n\nSo please remember, if you know of a pump and dump you have long missed the boat.",
