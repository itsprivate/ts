When you all see this, just remember crypto as an asset class was invented barely more than 10 ten years ago and it&#39;s already a $3T market cap asset.  And it&#39;s really important to know that it didn&#39;t hit $1T until 2021.

There is no &quot;unless&quot;.  Always ask what #s they&#39;re seeing that suggest there&#39;s an &quot;unless&quot; in the picture.  E-commerce didn&#39;t hit $3T ~10 years after the invention of the internet.  We&#39;re in the fastest growing sector ever and people are trying to convince you there&#39;s no growth or adoption.  Just remember the reality of it... faster growth than e-commerce, which changed the world, being spun as the industry spinning in its tracks going nowhere.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
