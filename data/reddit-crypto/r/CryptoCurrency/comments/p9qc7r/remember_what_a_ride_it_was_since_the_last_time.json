Specially on the bumpy road we had here since the last time BTC departed 50 grand.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how China kicked miners, and spreaded powerful FUD, taking miners elsewhere and opening new mines in many countries.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how Elon stopped accepting BTC and partially caused the spiral down that took BTC to 28k.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the billions liquidated in crypto longs.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the discussion about BTC , energy consumption and the enviroment that this movement triggered.</p>\n\n<p>Remember Microstrategy taking a loan of around half a billion to buy more BTC at 37k.</p>\n\n<p>Remember seeing ADA under $1. Yeah I know.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Moons for like 7 cents....</p>\n\n<p>Remember the Doge rollercoaster, and the rise of memecoins. Story still unfolding...</p>\n\n<p>Out of the blue, El Salvador became the first country to make BTC a legal tender!</p>\n\n<p>Oh and Mark Cuban got rugpulled.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that someone killed John McAfee, holy shit. Does anyone know what even happened to this guy?</p>\n\n<p>Remember the Amazon tease.</p>\n\n<p>Britney Spears has been using BTC since 2014? </p>\n\n<p>Mandatory remember: fuck robinhood.</p>\n\n<p>Remember all the FUD, and how people was sure of BTC hitting 20k or 18k.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And most importantly, remember all you learned since then.</strong> Most of us, didn&#39;t even know what a smart contract was back in april, or used to read PoS as &quot;piece of shit&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Hell I think even politicians have learnt some things, at least the proposal to ammend the Infrastructure Bill showed a couple of senators either knew more about the issue or got better advisors.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, when we see the news reporting BTC at 50k and a new FOMO cycle all around, it will have such a different meaning.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a great season ending, I&#39;m eager to see what will come next.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The train has left the 50k station, see you at 100k</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
