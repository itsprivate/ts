The range of 2<sup>64</sup> </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve posted about it before and stated how its now widely accepted that the puzzle is actually a brute force challenge. As all current found keys have been brute forced. However the current keys could take 37 billion years + at 1 million keys a second. 171 years for 64 alone using massive computing power. You could mine 100 BTC faster and cheaper than brute force the puzzle </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve started to think that there is a solution to the puzzle but it is unique. E.g it is a peace of external information that only someone who: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Knew Satoshi personaly </li>\n<li>Knew the mysterious puzzle creator </li>\n<li>Knows some deep information about the creation of BTC </li>\n<li>Understands something about BTC that the average programmer user does not </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To put this into context the higher the price of BTC goes up the bigger the price. If it goes another 7 years the prize may be worth $10 million + </p>\n\n<p>If anyone wants to give it a go  link to a site with current keys found below: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx\">https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
