Held onto it for almost a year (xrp seemed like it was the last coin to take off but it REALLY took off) and it kept going up and up. When it went up to $0.80 (8x my original investment) i said this is enough, im gonna take this profit and i pressed the sell button. Guess what… it kept going up and up. It was up EVERYTIME i pressed the refresh button for like two weeks. At the end, it went up to nearly $4.00!!!! And let me tell you, seeing something take off like that AFTER i sold was the most painful thing i have ever experienced. It was worst than losing 99% on my other shit coins during the bear market. So let it be known, seeing your holdings skyrocket after you take some profits is the most painful thing you’ll ever experience.</p>\n\n<p>Now down vote me, I don’t care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
