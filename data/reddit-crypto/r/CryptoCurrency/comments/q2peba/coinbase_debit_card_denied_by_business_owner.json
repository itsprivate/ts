Guy at the register looks at it for a moment and hands it back saying he can&#39;t accept this form of payment. I explain it&#39;s just a debit card, and if he runs it it&#39;ll be charged just like any other debit card, but he insists on not accepting it. In an extremely rare turn of events I decide to be a bit assertive (really wanted that XLM I guess) and ask if a manager is available so I can explain, and he replied that he owns the place so it&#39;s his call. I ended up using another form of payment only because one of my picks was rare and severely underpriced, but left wondering why any business owner would turn it down.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone know if there was a legit reason, or was this guy just not accepting it on &quot;principle&quot; or something?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I did point out the Visa logo, but he just kind of waved it off like it wasn&#39;t sufficient and repeated that I&#39;d have to use something else (a different Visa lol).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: This happened in the U.S.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
