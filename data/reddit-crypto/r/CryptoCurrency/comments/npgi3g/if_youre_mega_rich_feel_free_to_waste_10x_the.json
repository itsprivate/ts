Just a little more extra money running one miner compared to the expenses the average American has.  You're not gonna make even close to $20K extra a year running a single miner in your home unless BTC has another massive bullrun.   I'd be a millionaire, I'd sell everything to have 50 miners.  \n\nDespite this fact, the media and the non-crypto masses will view you as a wasteful piece of shit.   Doesn't matter what you're going through either.    Lost your job, lost your business because of forced lockdowns.\n\nSo you're a piece of shit for trying to open your business, and now that you found a new way to make some extra cash mining, you're a piece of shit for that. \n\nBut if you're rich...\n\nMost people will probably view you as very intelligent based off how much money you have.   After all, more money = more IQ.\n\n*Wow, that guy has lots of money, he must be smart* \n\nNobody will call you out for running 10 Central Air units 24/7 in the spring/summer when you only spend 10 days home. \n\nI worked as an HVAC tech for over 10 years.  In Bergen county in around the town of Alpine(Where Chris Rock lives/lived)  I've worked in plenty of these homes that are running 6-10 HVAC units, and one extra in the guest house.   One unit is running more energy than a miner, and they definitely run them all day to maintain temps because usually there's plenty of massive glass cathedral like windows letting sun light and heat in.    Also the one int eh guest house has to run and maintain 70F...JUST IN CASE a special guest arrives. \n\n1 Antminer S9 running 24hours a day is using a total of 36KWH \n\n1 5 Ton central AC unit running 12Hrs a day is using 60KWH\n\nRule of thumb is 1KWH per ton. 5 TON = 5KWH x 12 = 60KWH.\n\nNow imagine 6 5 ton units on average running while these FKs are getting their balls shaved in Bahamas?  I've seen 10.  The guy was NEVER HOME.  Only person I met was the house sitter. A guy that got lost showing me around. We kept opening closets that we thought were doors.    That's 600KWH in 12 hours.    😲.  Idk guy owns a company that makes airplane parts. \n\nThink they give a shit?  Not at all.  The media knows not to call them out because maybe they are scared about the connections they have. Maybe they will be out of the job?\n\nBut who's scared of regular people?  Let's just call them out as they continue to devalue their hard earned inflated fiat, and fill them with empty promises when it comes vote time. \n\n\nIf you want to run a miner.   Run a miner.  Don't  feel bad.  You're trying to get a little extra. Times are tough.   Don't live your life abiding by other people's ignorant needs.",
