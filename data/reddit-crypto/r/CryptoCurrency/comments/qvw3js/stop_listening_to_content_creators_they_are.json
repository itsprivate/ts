Posts that have &quot;hopium&quot; or positive outlooks garner way more views and interactions than bearish ones, thus making more money. While it&#39;s nice to have a positive outlook, these guys will be telling you everything is OK and to buy the dip all the way down to 0 because they will still be making TONS OF MONEY by saying that. If the market truly collapses and goes into a multiyear bear market, they will still be making money off hopium while everyone else loses a lot of money. They are in a win/win situation with their content and they do not care about you. They care about selling their hopium as views which makes them money. If the market tanks, goes sideways, or moons, they will be making money. You have ZERO evidence they believe in crypto as much as they say and you have ZERO evidence they even have their money where their mouth is. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone is a genius in a bull market and hopium is selling at an absolute premium right now. Always be careful listening to people who literally get paid to say certain things by people looking to hear those certain things. When things change, they will not change with the times.</p>\n\n<p>If YOU believe in Crypto, that&#39;s all that matters. Don&#39;t believe in Crypto because someone is making money telling you to believe in it. Form your own opinions. Crypto content is massive right now and people make A LOT more money posting hopium than they ever will telling you to be careful and pointing out the risks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
