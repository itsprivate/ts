Moreover, I find it interesting that many who&#39;ve even been interested/invested in cryptocurrency, continue to show minimal interest in some core principles of economics, such as: Market capitalization, &#39;Tokenomics&#39;, reading a whitepaper, trading/investment principals....and possibly most disturbingly <strong>Distribution of Tokens (wealth)!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imagine for a moment a small elite group of 100 people, in control of assets used by millions. Able to manipulate the market at will, and cash in on their centralized game at any time...Its a scary fate to imagine, especially if you&#39;re one of those players in their game.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that this isn&#39;t imaginary....it&#39;s quite literally what the current cyrpto market looks like...</p>\n\n<p>Enter, <strong>Shiba Inu....Where 82.14%</strong> of all tokens are owned by just 100 people!</p>\n\n<p>Or even worse <strong>Binance...Where 98.8% of USD coin</strong> and <strong>95.57% of Binance Coin</strong> is owned by the Top 100 holders.</p>\n\n<p>I know what you&#39;re thinking...another post shaming SHIBA, blah, blah, blah....Well, you&#39;re right.
