If it is still too expensive, and i have to work my ass off to be able to have nice things in virtual universe then whats the fun? Then its not a game, its just another market for companies to sell their products, well virtual products.\nRight now metavers games are not fun, you have to work for every thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
