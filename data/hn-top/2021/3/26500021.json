It’s embarrassing, but I’m so wiped out after a day of work, that my brain just doesn’t feel like doing anything.<p>I’m sitting here in my bedroom looking at a book I’ve been meaning to finish for months, but it’s complex enough that when I start working on the next chapter, I get a quarter of the way through it and have to put it down, because I just dont “get it” when I feel this way.<p>Across from me is my desk, with a computer where somewhere on it, is a half built personal website I was using as a way to teach myself web development. But when I open it up and start working on it, I feel like I’m missing that spark that makes the right connections to learn new things like JavaScript objects and how they work.<p>I have Duolingo on my phone, which I complete in spurts lasting 2 or 3 days then I drop for maybe a week or so, even though I know it’s only “10 minutes a day”. If I do it now, I won’t remember most of it tomorrow.<p>My job isn’t particularly demanding. It’s average. I don’t work more than maybe 8-9 hours a day on stuff that I understand most of but still have a chance to learn new things. My point is it’s not like it’s a brutal work culture at all.<p>I even exercise mid day or after work (depending on how busy I am) which is proportioned to give one energy, not take it away.<p>But yet at the end of the day, I’m just beat.<p>How do you find the motivation to do the things you genuinely enjoy, when you’re too wiped out to do them?<p>Is this normal?",
