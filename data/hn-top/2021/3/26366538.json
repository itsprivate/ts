I am specifically looking for stories like:\n1) I posted this project and I started some company. Sold it or earning a lot of money or living my dream\n2) I was hired because of my post on HN.\n3) Girls chasing you because of your reputation as HN or met your wife because of your cool project ( Please don&#x27;t hate me for this)<p>Basically money, power etc..<p>Forgive me for being blunt but I am not looking for &quot;10-sec fame&quot;. I mean one day you got traffic 100K on the website. Good. But just\nfor one day. Also, I am not sure blogging count as a tangible benefit unless it is paid service. I hope you understand my point.<p>Also intellectual debate, I get more information, I feel smart as benefits etc. don&#x27;t count in this context.",
