  "story_text": "Hi HN!<p>My son recently turned 7yo and I have successfully got him interested in programming. We started about half a year ago playing Minecraft and building more and more complicated automated machines. Recently I have added some robots that can be programmed in Scratch and now we have also started writing some simple games in Scratch.<p>I am not just trying to teach him programming but also show that with a bit of organization and working little bit each day you can achieve pretty huge results. So we created a very simple version of a game. I have then created a document where we are maintaining a listing of functionality we want to add. We then take them one by one, discuss how it can be added to the game and then tick off once it is done.<p>For Christmas he asked for some programming books (&quot;how to make complicated Minecraft machines, how to write complicated commands and how to make mods&quot;).<p>We plan to do some more complicated robots and also make our own fun mods for Minecraft (as soon as I figure out how to hook up Scratch to recent version of it).<p>I am trying to not spend too much time on any given day (about 1,5h every day currently) so that ends up still wanting to do more.<p>I am also doing large part of coding myself and we switch who sits by the editor when he says he knows how to do something. I am trying to keep him enthusiastic by showing constant progress which I think is more important than that he actually does everything by himself.<p>I have 20 years of development experience so generally programming is not an issue for me.<p>Please, share your experiences, things that you have tested with your kids that did or did not work. Any tips you have personally tested.",
