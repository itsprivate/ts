(Based in Netherlands).<p>I&#x27;m sharing this because I&#x27;m looking for people who went through a similar situation. I went from &quot;coding in my bedroom next to my university study&quot; to &quot;doing technical interviews with senior engineers&quot; and &quot;enterprise sales to c-level people&quot; within a year. I do like to push myself way beyond my comfort zone (it&#x27;s my go-to strategy for learning new stuff) but sometimes it is quite overwhelming. Sometimes, when I can take a step back, I realize how insane this situation is.<p>Luckily I have supporting parents and peers, who try to advise where they can, but none of them have experience running a fast growing company.<p>Anyway. If anyone has had a similar experience, please share. If you know a community&#x2F;network with similar people, please share.",
