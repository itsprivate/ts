I have read Hacker News sometimes but only thought about sharing my own post after seeing Manara&#x27;s post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25849054)last month. I asked them if I can share this here and they said it was a good idea. :)<p>I’m a 19-year-old Gazan female who participated in Manara last year and got internships at Google and Repl.it. I’m so excited I will spend this summer at Google in Europe! I got lots of questions about my experience when people heard about it on Facebook so I wrote this blog post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaawad28.medium.com&#x2F;my-experience-as-a-gazan-girl-getting-into-silicon-valley-companies-488062d769a1) to let other young engineers in Palestine and the Middle East know how they can get into amazing companies like this too.<p>If you are an engineer or student like me, read it and apply to Manara, they will help you so much!!<p>Btw I have a few friends who just finished the Manara program and are looking for internships now so if you have opportunities make sure to talk to Manara (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manara.tech). Ask them about Rula and Hend! :)))",
