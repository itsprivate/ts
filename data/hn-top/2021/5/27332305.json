During my first interview with the HR I set an expectation of $40 for my hourly rate. But during my subsequent interview with the CTO, he complained about my hourly rate and said that it was too high compared to your skillset and expertise. I deliberately pitch too high in the start so I can get away with a good deal later.<p>The interviews are over, right now it is not guaranteed they will go with me. But assuming they give me an offer, I have a feeling they will offer me some where around $30&#x2F;hr (just this rate, no other compensation) for this position which I am happy to accept.<p>The question is, when they offer me with a lower rate how should I deal with the situation so that I don&#x27;t loose the position and get away with the best deal?<p>P.S The company is US-based with a development team spread all across the globe. I am from South Asia and even $30&#x2F;h is a very big deal.",
