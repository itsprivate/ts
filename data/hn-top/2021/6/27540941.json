  "story_text": "Despite my best efforts, in the past few years I have had no luck with desk chairs--each one I&#x27;ve had grows uncomfortable after 10-15 minutes of working. This discomfort manifests as sore legs, sore back, feeling too warm, poor seating posture, and similar inconveniences. I recognize the need to stand up and stretch periodically, but these uncomfy chairs make it really difficult to get into the zone.<p>Have you found a chair that makes you happy? Given the amount of time I must spend at a keyboard, I am willing to spend real money. For reference, I am a 40ish 5&#x27;10&quot; male with an average build (pandemic deterioration notwithstanding).<p>I also have a treadmill desk, and it&#x27;s great for humdrum work, but sometimes it is necessary to sit down and dig in when the task at hand is more challenging.",
