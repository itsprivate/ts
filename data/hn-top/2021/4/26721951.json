Ideally being done in 2 hours in the morning then chilling would be perfect.)<p>- Low expectactions &#x2F; vague job description.<p>- Salary can be on the lower side.<p>- No career advancement possibilities required. Only tech, I do not want to manage people.<p>- Can be about helping other developers, setting up infrastructure&#x2F;deploy or pure data management since this is fun.<p>I think the only possible jobs would be some kind of backend-only dev or devops&#x2F;sysadmin work.
