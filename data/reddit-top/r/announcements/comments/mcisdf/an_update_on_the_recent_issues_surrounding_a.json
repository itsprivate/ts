We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both.

The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.\n\nWe care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications.
