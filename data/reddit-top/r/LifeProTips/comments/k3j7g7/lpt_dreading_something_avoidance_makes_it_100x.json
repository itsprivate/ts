Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.\n\nIf your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going \"nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback.\" You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain's response to the stimulus around you (emotions). Even if it is an uncomfortable situation, your brain will recognise that it's helping you achieve your goal, so the feedback it gives you (emotions) will be much more positive. It all starts with what you want to achieve and if you don't know, then spend some time figuring that out. Goal clarity is like giving your brain a quest marker.\n\nYou are hardwired for struggle, go forth in courage my comrades!",
