I quit and needed something fast at night while I look for something better during the day. </p>\n\n<p>It was a data entry position, meaning I get an email containing the details of an order and proceeding to input the information into our system. </p>\n\n<p>Right after my training I knew this is something Autohotkey can do, I don&#39;t know to code that well, so I went to a freelancer website to hire a guy to develop the code, it cost me a two-month salary....</p>\n\n<p>I just had to input how many orders I want to process per hour, since day 1 I was working from home because the company did not want to pay for transport or cleaning during the graveyard shift. </p>\n\n<p>For the first 2 years, I would check if there was something the code cannot do (usually took me less than 5 minutes) and then I would let the computer running and watch movies, go to bed, sometimes I&#39;d even go out. Then I added those functions to the code as well. </p>\n\n<p>I was doing such a remarkable job I was offered promotions a few times, new positions during the daytime that I&#39;d reject stating I&#39;m a very introverted person that enjoys this type of position.  </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I got another job, better paid, but there was no reason for me to quit where I was working. For my data entry job, I could spend months without having anybody reach out to me. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes some co-workers will try to match my order entry quota, which would make me open the code, and change an 8 to 9 to increase my production and keep myself on top. I&#39;d change the numbers regularly &quot;just in case&quot; but nobody even noticed. </p>\n\n<p>I even got 2 salary raises at some point for never missing a day, and being the top producer in my 3 people department, to which I corresponded by changing the 9 and switching it to an 11 or 10 on some days. </p>\n\n<p>My end. </p>\n\n<p>It took them 4 years to develop new software that will replace my data entry position. Since clients were granted access to our new system. A few weeks ago I got my severance check, I was told I could keep the laptop and office equipment and that I&#39;m welcome to apply for any position I want.</p>\n\n<p>I never talked about that with anybody IRL, not even my family, even my wife wasn&#39;t sure what my job was about with that other company. </p>\n\n<p>Now that it is over. There you go, my darkest work secret.</p>\n\n<p>I did try to schedule a demonstration of &quot;my code&quot;, I think that was back in 2017. The regional manager told me they&#39;re very busy dealing with the important stuff, just to keep doing the good work I was doing.... which I fucking did until the day I was let go.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
