  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working sales at a car dealership for about 6 months averaging about 75 hours a week (the norm if you want to be “successful”)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s almost 11pm and I’m about to leave the dealership and go home for the weekend. My boss “John” who is the owners son comes up to me and starts giving me shit for not closing my last deal (even tho I’m sitting at 14 sold in total this month and have made HIM about $60,000 gross profit for his dealership)\nWe go back and fourth blah blah blah he then turns around and says “we might have to find you something else if you keep up this behaviour.” And proceeds to walk towards me points his finger in my face and says just as the title says “do you know my last name” and I stood there stunned no clue what to say so I just said “yeah I do” and proceeded to turn around walk away and walk to my general mangers office and I quit there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was one of two salesmen (small town) and left on a Friday understaffed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I moved back to my home city found an absolutely amazing new job and I go snowboarding everyday after work and life has gotten so much better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: don’t do car sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: HOLY FUCK I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO BLOW UP LIKE THIS in only 5 hours :D thank you all for the up votes and comments. I apologize for my spelling and punctuation 😂 I was typing this super fast and off the top of my head didn’t think many people would see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full story is rather complicated this is just a taste of what it was like at this dealership.\nNot every dealership is like this Obviously 🙄 my TLDR is mostly a joke those in car sales will understand why &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my very first time sharing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
