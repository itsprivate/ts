During covid, our revenue skyrocketed as we were all able to work from home in a high demand industry. My boss, the business owner asked for my input in how we reward the team - he was thinking a team activity or Xmas bonus.  </p>\n\n<p>This sub has really made me question why we spend so much of our life working just to get by, so I put together a proposal - let’s work less and give everyone more space in their personal life. </p>\n\n<p>My proposal was:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>to provide a permanent pay increase of 10% to all staff. </p></li>\n<li><p>give an extra 5 days off per year (I come from a country where 4 weeks is standard, so this increased to 5 weeks total).</p></li>\n<li><p>make Monday an optional work day. Finish all your work from last week? Great, don’t come in. The week officially begins on Tuesday and that’s when we meet together. Feeling a little behind? Your Monday is for you to catch up from home, and you don’t have to meet or work with anyone else. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The proposal was accepted 4 months ago, and all I can say is wowwww - what a difference it’s made to the team happiness, with no decline in revenue. </p>\n\n<p>It’s a fairly different story to what is posted here usually, but I wanted to share it, as without this sub I would never have thought to suggest such a thing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
