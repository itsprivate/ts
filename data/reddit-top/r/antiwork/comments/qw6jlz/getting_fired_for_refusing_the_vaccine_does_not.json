I won&#39;t shed a tear for you losing your job and not being able to collect unemployment either. (Edit - Changed Hundreds of Thousands to Millions! Sorry at first I was just using US numbers but I should have included all countries in my number)</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t try to lump yourself in with the rest of the anti-work community because the issue here isn&#39;t a big corporation or a slew of terrible managers - it&#39;s you. </p>\n\n<p>Get vaccinated - it saves lives!! </p>\n\n<p>Edited to add: Thanks for the awards!</p>\n\n<p>One more edit to add: My intent for this post was never to divide the sub. Those who lose their jobs due to refusing the vaccine are suffering consequences to their own actions. AntiWork is about people who have no control over their work hours, their pay or how shitty they are treated by employers.</p>\n\n<p>One last edit to those who said the vaccinated can carry the virus too. Yes, I know. I didn&#39;t think I needed to add that but apparently I did. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
