Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, \"you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?\" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. \n\nI just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, \"he's just trying to make a living\". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.\n\n \nYou know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. \n\n\nThis is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. \n\nTo be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street. \n\n\ntl;dr - I like this stock. I like you all. Big like, no sell\n\nEdit: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ can we cook tendies out on Saturn or do we need to bring our own?\n\nEdit 2: Stop messaging me asking for financial advice I'm a retard and I'm not giving any advice I just like the stock\n\nEdit 3: If anybody messages you for financial advice I'd ignore it. 80% of the messages are worded very similarly and are asked by low karma accounts.
