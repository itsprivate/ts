  "description": "Duck Life is a game that I never thought I'd speedrun, but I definitely don't regret it. This game is in a class of its own.\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Discord: https://discord.gg/Fz6Dtdq\n\nWatch the world record run here: https://youtu.be/jkwzJMapPeU\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #DuckLife #Speedrun",
