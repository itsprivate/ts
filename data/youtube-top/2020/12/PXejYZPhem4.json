  "description": "Skeppy makes BadBoyHalo change his perspective. This was amazing.\n\nFollow My Twitter - @Skeppy\n\nFollow My Instagram - @Skeppy\n\nToday I took BadBoyHalo on a tour of my home on the \"new\" Minecraft Server Update LMAO. BadBoyHalo gets lost and I have to save him (as usual), I show off my bedroom, mirror room and my farm and I think he got scared? He refuses to come to my house now? Bad absolutely lost his mind this video so if this gets 100,000 likes I might let him out of the simulation (or you could say: Bad absolutely lost his mind this video so if this does not get 100k likes may all your servers be CURSED)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is me pushing Bad to the edge of insanity.",
