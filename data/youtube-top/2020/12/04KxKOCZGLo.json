  "description": "Pretending to Put My Dog on a Diet\n\nToday we pretended to put Tucker on a diet. He loves to eat his food so much so we wanted to see his reaction if we gave him a few bites to eat at a time. Needless to say he demanded the full meal and would not stop until he ate every last bite.\n\nWhat was your favorite part???\n\nTUCKER MERCH IS HERE!!!\nhttps://www.tuckerbudzyn.shop\n\nGet the Official Tucker Budzyn App on IOS or Android:\nhttps://doggymojis.com/tuckermoji\n\nFOLLOW ME:\n» Tucker's 2nd Channel: https://bit.ly/3aHgqcE\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tuckerbudzyn\n» Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tuckerbudzyn\n» TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tuckerbudzyn\n» Twitter: https://twitter.com/tuckerbudzyn\n» My Mommy: https://bit.ly/2xCCfVw\n\n\nTucker's Favorite Products!\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/tuckerbudzyn\n\n\nBusiness Inquiries: tuckerbudzyn@gmail.com\n\n#DogDietChallenge",
