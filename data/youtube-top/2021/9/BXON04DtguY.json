It was HILARIOUS. #myles #shorts​ #tiktok​ #short​ #Minecraft​\n\nThis Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.5, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.17 in 2021 (almost 2022)!\n\nThe goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, Myles from tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.17.1 and not Minecraft Bedrock.\n\nTHIS IS THE GREATEST SHORT EVER!!!!!",
