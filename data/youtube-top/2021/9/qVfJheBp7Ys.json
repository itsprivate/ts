  "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! So, a couple of months ago I got this ad on facebook for \"digital fashion\" - which, as a weird fashion lover, piqued my interest. So, I decided to use the DressX digital fashion service and \"wear\" digital clothes every day for a week to see how it turned out -- and then I posted those pictures to instagram to see what you all thought of my virtual digs! Which outfit from this week was your favorite? \n\nYou can check out DressX's website here! \nhttps://dressx.com/\n\nQuick note -- these looks that we bought are *not* NFTs, and most of DressX's looks are not NFTs -- (the ones in the app are also not NFTs) -- they seem to dipping their toes into that space, but for now it's mainly just photoshopping individual images!\n\nAlso, the shots in the art museum were taken in the middle of the summer, when mask mandates were lifted!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/â€‹\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington\nJordan Schneier\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",
