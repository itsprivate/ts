This is totally different than my normal content where I redesign minecraft mobs or design playbuttons for youtubers. I hope you like it even though it's not a normal video! In the end, I'm very proud with what I was able to achieve in such a short time, but if I had more time, it would have been even greater. The Minecraft wither spider I made is a reference to the time where I redesigned minecraft bosses in 3d software\n\n//about\nMy name's daniel and I design things. Usually I do 3d modeling in blender but I'm now a metal worker thanks to mr beast apparently??? Who knows what I'll design in the future. If you have any ideas please let me know",
