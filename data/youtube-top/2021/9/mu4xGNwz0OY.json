  "description": "The Florida State Seminoles lost in overtime against the reloaded Notre Dame Fighting Irish who went to the CFP last season.  The game featured 79 points, including 5 touchdowns by each team, 873 combined yards of offense and countless great plays.  Included in the excitement was McKenzie Milton returning to college football action two years after a catastrophic knee injury and leading FSU on a key touchdown drive and down the field for the game-tying field goal.",
