  "description": "On part two of our trip to Audi HQ in Ingolstadt, Germany, we stop by Audi Tradition, the brand's secret storage facility where  they let me drive not one but TWO of the most iconic rally cars of all time.  Walter Röhrl’s Monte Carlo winning Group B Sport Quattro S1 E2, and the top secret Group S prototype car (that only 5 people had driven previous to me). Childhood dream type stuff!! \n\nSubscribe to my channel for more: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpCJ0y-_y03qPlG4zrYAAvQ?sub_confirmation=1\nFollow me on Instagram: @kblock43\nFollow on Facebook: facebook.com/kenblockracing\n\nRad gear that The Hoonigans make for me: https://www.hoonigan.com/collections/ken-block\n\n#BlockGoesEtron\n#BLOCKxAUDI\n#AudiPartner",
