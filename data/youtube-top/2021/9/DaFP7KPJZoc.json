  "description": "Thank you DraftKings for sponsoring this video. Use promo code UTREE to get a shot at MILLIONS OF DOLLARS in total prizes! URL Here: http://dkng.co/UTree\n\nFor entertainment purposes only. Winning a contest on DraftKings depends on knowledge and exercise of skill. Available to play for free. Residents of HI, ID, MT, NV and WA not eligible to play in paid contests. Not a gambling website. See www.ncrg.org for information regarding responsible gaming. Must be at least 18 years or older. Higher age limits may apply in some states. Void where prohibited. See www.draftkings.com for details. â€œI am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is Schlasser) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on. Although I have expressed my personal view on the games and strategies above, they do not necessarily reflect the view(s) of DraftKings and I may also deploy different players and strategies than what I recommend above. I am not an employee of DraftKings and do not have access to any non-public information.\n\nSo it's come to this: The NFC is now under the superior might of Tom Brady somehow ruining everything (and Patriots fans celebrating the win by proxy). The more things change, the more they somehow stay the same. Perhaps we will experience an existential crisis as life falls apart all around us. Thank the lord for football to distract us from it.\n\nThe fifteen other teams in the NFC are looking to overthrow Tampa Bay as Super Bowl Champion; each with their stories and plotlines to consider and dissect. There are their stories, both the good and the bad.\n\nSomeone please end Brady's reign, if only for the league's sake.",
