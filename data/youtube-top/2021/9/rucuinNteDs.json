This was super cool! \nWe were able to experience Minecraft in a way never seen before!\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nDream: @Dream \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nThis is a Minecraft 1.16 Mod that allows us to see Minecraft from the 2D perspective! This was super cool and a new way to experience the game! Even though this may have seemed easy, this challenge was actually difficult! Will we be able to beat the game? This was a lot of fun and I love doing challenges like this with my friends.",
