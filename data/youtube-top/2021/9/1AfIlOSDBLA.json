Carson Daly returns as host. The show's innovative format features four stages of competition: Blind Auditions, Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and Live Performance Shows.\n\nThis season's Battle Advisors include Jason Aldean (Team Kelly), Kristin Chenoweth (Team Ariana), Camila Cabello (Team Legend), and Dierks Bentley (Team Blake). For the Knockouts, one superstar Mega Mentor will work with all the coaches and their teams.\n\nIn the Live Performance Shows, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast, and the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n\nGymani Kills It, Singing Ariana Grande's \"pov\" in Front of Ariana | The Voice Blind Auditions 2021\nhttps://youtu.be/1AfIlOSDBLA\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice",
