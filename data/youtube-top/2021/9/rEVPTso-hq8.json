  "description": "Minecraft's RAREST and most INSANE seeds and Minecraft worlds to EVER EXIST. We searched 1 Trillion seeds and these seeds and video are the real deal, you will not find them any other place besides this Minecraft video. \n\nHELP ME HIT 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMINECRAFT@HOME DISCORD LINK: https://discord.gg/3aFS2MrHvH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Twitch: SipoverS\n\nMy Twitter: SipoverS\n\nMy Instagram: SipoverS \n\nMy Discord: https://discord.gg/qFrX5Qb\n\nNot Minecraft's History on Youtube or Glitches, or even the entire history of minecraft i guess AND very similar but also not The Story of Minecraft, and not even close to Ranking Minecraft's rarest occurrences and Minecrafts most mind-blowing inventions. Dream could totally use some of these seeds for a manhunt speedrunner vs hunters... Or maybe even tommyinnit in a Minecraft Mod video. It's pretty similar to Minecraft's Most Unbelievable Seeds though. \n\nCREDITS (reddit posts included):\nMinecraft@Home - Matt, Cortex, DylanDC14, Mooing_Cowmilk, Tomlacko\nInsane Mountain Spawn https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/erz9l4/modern_version_of_the_seed_gargamel_might_not/\nNatural Drop https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/n4461d/seed_with_a_natural_drop_of_239_blocks/\nEnd City Loot https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/n2wh7m/end_city_with_70_diamond_items_and_60_diamonds/ \nBiggest Ocean https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/n5lofm/the_first_25_tile_ocean_seed_has_been_found/ \nFull Shipwreck https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/p8qyri/two_halves_of_a_shipwreck_joins_to_form_one/ \nMore Info on End Seed Fact https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Feq0dHw28 \n2 Floating Blocks https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftseeds/comments/n7dj0h/you_literally_spawn_on_these_two_floating_blocks/ \nNo House Village https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/i392kj/i_found_a_village_without_any_houses_in_it/",
