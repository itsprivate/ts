GOODLUCK\n\n#Fundy #Minecraft #ImpossibleDifficulty\n\nnow the word soup:\n\nIn this video I dont play on the DreamSMP, but instead I made one of my babymode difficulties, or impossible difficulties. It makes minecraft impossible in the hopes of a minecraft, but video like dream / dreamwastaken or george / georgenotfound or tommyinnit or wilbur or other dream smp members have done in the past. I coded it so that minecraft is actually impossible, and this is a custom difficulty / challenge / minecraft but for you to try out! I hope you enjoy this fun little project, it was a blast to record and make, and I definitely did enjoy it. I hope you have fun watching!",
