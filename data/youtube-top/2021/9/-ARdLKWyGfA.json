Here's What Happened\n\nDownload Monster Legends to get your free limited time reward: https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/QSYm/Silver\n\nFollow My Socials:\n• twitter: https://twitter.com/speedsilverr\n• twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/speedsilver​​\n• discord: https://discord.gg/uhPP2zscDw\n• tiktok: @SpeedSilver\n\nPlay with this Mod by joining my Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/speedsilver\n\nEdited by Silver & Semit (@semitlive on twitter)\n\nThis is a Minecraft Challenge in which I try to survive 200 Days, and I can Shapeshift! There are also crazy Custom Shapeshifts like the Gorilla, Tiger and the SEA DRAGON. This is not a Minecraft Speedrunner VS Hunter, but a 'Minecraft 100 Days' challenge... This was completely insane.\n\nAlso, I had to play on 'Hard' difficulty instead of 'Hardcore' since the shapeshifter mod counted me shapeshifting as dying and deleted the world. Hopefully you guys understand!\n\n#100Days​​ #Hardcore​​ #Minecraft",
