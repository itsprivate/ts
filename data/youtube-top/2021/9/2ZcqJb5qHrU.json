It's me, mart, AKA martincitopants, here to play factorio (not MINECRAFT with DREAM (DREER)) I recently purchased a Nuclear Submarine for Australia under the AUKUS deal (I don't know what that means but I bought big bunch of them hehe). This caused KIM KARDASHIAN to marry me instead of Kanye West (Donda (Donald)). THE GIBBERISH CONTINUES... POST KIM MARRIAGE I WAS INVITED TO THE MET GALA, WHERE I WAS BIRTHED FROM LIL NAS X with an iPhone 13 in my hand. I RACED VSAUCE MICHAEL HERE IN FORMULA 1 ON FORTNITE (chairs). yej. this video is definitely about Mr Beast, CALL OF DUTY VANGUARD, AND BATTLEFIELD 2042 COMBINED. (wow). Shremwaldo fought Mr beast and won in an illegal dogfighting ring (UEFA champions league). \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/martincitopants\n\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/martincitopants\n\nVOD channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChp9HmpAUJx2352TFlgaZdw\n\nMonke video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Sw76-Fe_M",
