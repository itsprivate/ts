I teamed up with the one and only Guga Foods to attempt to set 3 Wagyu Beef records. He did the preparing, I did the eating!\n\nFull disclosure, I couldn't find a 100% reliable source on the calorie count, but they say it's 677 per 4oz, so thats crazy!!\n\nENJOY!!!\n\n---Socials & Stuff----\nFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/mattmegatoadstonie\nINSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/matt_stonie\nTWITCH - https://www.twitch.tv/mattstonie\nTIKTOK - https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRheEAwc/\nTWITTER - https://www.twitter.com/mattstonie\nWEBSITE - http://www.mattstonie.com\nMERCH - http://www.mattstoniemerch.com\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.
