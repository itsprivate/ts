In this breakdown we're gonna be giving a big recap of the entire thing before going into what could be happening in the finale next.\n\nNow what is a spoiler filled breakdown if not just a spoiler free one persevering? I really dunno but if you haven't had a chance to check out the episode then I suggest you check out now. Make sure you like the video and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss next weeks breakdown as we will of course be talking about the finale.\n\nWith that out the way thanks for clicking this, now let's get into What If.\n\nOk so last weeks episode ended with the biggest party pooper of them all arriving on the scene. Ultron had arrived and with him he brought not only his Iron Legion of Ultron Bots but also the Infinity Stones and Vision's face.\n\nI forgot to point out last time that the way that the mask opened up was clearly a nod to Tony Stark's Iron Man one in reverse. Tony actually of course helped to build Ultron in the MCU and because of this it took on several of his personality traits.\n\nThese included his speech patterns and sayings and one of them even triggered Kalue into realising who made him. However it actually went far beyond that and in the movie both the characters struggled over the word children.\n\nI absolutely love details like this and the episode should sort of be seen as Visions revenge for all those times that he died...which was a lot...it was a lot wasn't it.\n\nNow the episode basically reframes Avengers Age Of Ultron and it asks what would have happened had Ultron won. In the film he attempts to shift his consciouness into Vision's body and had he achieved this then the character would have been almost indestructible. Whilst there are several callbacks to that film there's also some nods to Wandavision and other films involving killer machines.\n\nMusic By Lakey Inspired\n» Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lakeyinspired\n» Spotify: https://goo.gl/aLkwM5\n» SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired/\n» SnapChat: Lakeyinspired",
