  "description": "So surreal to be uploading this video but here we are. \nIf I missed anything in this video I'm sorry I felt like I was all over the place and couldn't remember half of what I wanted to say lol. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary to conceive. \n\nNo videos of my reaction or J's, I just straight up told him after I shook the test for a solid 10 minutes. 😂\nWe didn't end up telling anyone this time until I was past 12 weeks. \n\nThank you guys so much for all the encouraging words and congratulations. ❤️\n\nWe'll talk more in the upcoming vlogs. \n\nB U S I N E S S:\nFor Business and Branding purposes please\nvanessa.delmuro@gmail.com\nFor Public Relations please contact \nvanessa.delmuro@gmail.com\n\nSTAY CONNECTED WITH ME:\nInstagram: nicoleguerriero \nhttp://www.instagram.com/nicoleguerriero\nTIKTOK: @nicoleguerriero_\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/gJAp3k/\n\nThe End.",
