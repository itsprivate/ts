  "description": "Rest in Peace.. You meant more to us than life itself. I never knew this much pain, sadness, and sorrow were possible until you left us. I want to thank you for raising us and for literally everything.. I wish we could give you one last hug and make it last forever. If I could put all the words in every language together, it wouldn't express how much we love you. We love you more than everything. \nNot a day won't go by that we won't think of you.. You will continue to live on in our hearts and memories forever and we'll honor you by becoming the man you are. \nWe hope to see you again one day and give you that hug.\n\nRest In Peace Sweet Soul\n 外公 1943-2021",
