  "description": "The current generation #ToyotaTundra is old. It was last redesigned in 2007, making the 2021 model the oldest truck on the market. For 2022, @Toyota USA has finally given the #TundraTRDPRO the redesign it needs to stay competitive. It's new from the ground up with an electrified engine option in the form of the #TundraiForceMAX. Production of the new #Toyota #Tundra will begin in Nov with the new truck reaching dealer lots by the end of this year.\n\nWe're also on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redline_reviews\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/liketheredline\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tweettheredline",
