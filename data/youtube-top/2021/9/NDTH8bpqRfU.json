  "description": "The Apple iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are here with 120Hz high refresh rate displays, A15 Bionic processors, and all-new cameras. At a glance, the iPhone 13 Pro shares the bulk of its design with its predecessor, the iPhone 12 Pro. When you look closer, it’s the details that start to show the full story with this year's Apple flagship. Starting at $999 and $1,099, respectively, are the details enough to warrant an upgrade? \n\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.
