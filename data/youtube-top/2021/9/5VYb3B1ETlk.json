  "description": "This holiday season, the best gifts come with a bow. 🏹  Watch the new trailer for Marvel Studios’ “Hawkeye,” and start streaming the Original Series November 24 on Disney+: https://bit.ly/2XyBSIW\n\n► Subscribe to Marvel on YouTube: http://bit.ly/WeO3YJ\n\nDisney+ and Marvel Studios invite you on an unexpected holiday getaway, unwrapping a brand-new teaser trailer and poster today for “Hawkeye,” a new series set in post-blip New York City. Former Avenger Clint Barton has a seemingly simple mission: get back to his family for Christmas. Possible? Maybe with the help of Kate Bishop, a 22-year-old archer with dreams of becoming a Super Hero. The two are forced to work together when a presence from Barton’s past threatens to derail far more than the festive spirit. \n\nStarring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye and Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, “Hawkeye” also features Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James and newcomer Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez. Helmed by Rhys Thomas and directing duo Bert and Bertie, “Hawkeye” debuts exclusively on Disney+ on November 24, 2021.\n\nFollow Marvel on Twitter: ‪https://twitter.com/marvel\nLike Marvel on Facebook: ‪https://www.facebook.com/marvel\nWatch Marvel on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/marvel\n\nReward your Marvel fandom by joining Marvel Insider!\nEarn points, then redeem for awesome rewards.\nTerms and conditions apply. \nLearn more at https://www.marvel.com/insider?Osocial=YT&CID=MarvelInsider\n\nFor even more news, stay tuned to:\nTumblr: ‪http://marvelentertainment.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marvel\nPinterest: ‪http://pinterest.com/marvelofficial\nReddit: http://reddit.com/u/marvel-official",
