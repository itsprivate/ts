Check it out here: https://dkng.co/ROBER\n\nThanks to the good people of Gridley, CA and everyone else who helped out here.\n\nScience Bob has a new page about making Elephant's Toothpaste on your own- https://sciencebob.com/fantastic-foamy-fountain/\n\nShoutout to the one and only authentic Orbeez for providing the Orbeez.\n\nMerch!! https://markrober.store/\n\nIf you want to learn the process whereby you can make cool stuff too, join in my Creative Engineering class!! https://Monthly.com/MarkRober\n\nThis class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.\n\nDuring this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up with the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.\n\nThe best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.\n\nThis is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.\n\nSee you in class!\n\n-Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor entertainment purposes only.
