  "description": "Cuphead is a hard game, so it makes since that the speedrun would be hard as well, but I wasn't expecting it to be this painful...\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nTitle inspiration from my boy @PointCrow \nWatch the world record speedrun here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VHBGoWDFR0\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nIf you're wondering why I didn't use certain Cuphead glitches in this speedrun, it's because this is the 1.1+ category where they removed a lot of them. So this is more just using the regular tools to try to go fast.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",
