  "description": "The *emotional* end of an era. Goodbye.\n\nJoin the Creative Weirdo family and subscribe!: http://bit.ly/mrkateyoutube and check out our amazing sponsor Shipt here: https://www.shipt.com/mrkate \n\nIn today's episode we are saying goodbye to so many things, our house and all of you. Change is scary and change is hard, but change is also powerful. We are excited to discover the next phase of our journey and we can't wait to share that with you. If you've been with us since the beginning you know how emotional it is to say goodbye to our first home we've lived in for 8 years and lovingly renovated. We put so much love and hard work into this DIY fixer upper and so it's sad to say goodbye to it, but we've grown out of it and are excited to explore the world to see what's next, and hopefully find our dream home. Thank you home for all you have done for us and thank you to all of you for following along on our journey. To all of you, we say goodbye as we take a little time off to renew our creativity so that we can come back to you with a refreshed and inspired perspective.\n\n*Alcohol delivery available from select retailers and selection varies by location.
