  "description": "Ariana Grande - off the table ft. The Weeknd (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. The Weeknd showed up to assist his pal with the dreamy mood of “off the table.” As proven previously on tracks such as “Love Me Harder” and “Save Your Tears,” their chemistry is deep. The two stars glide through the song, helping each other reveal the nooks and crannies that are only obvious to accomplished musicians.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “off the table” ft. The Weeknd by Ariana Grande.
