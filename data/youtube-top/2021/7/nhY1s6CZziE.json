  "description": "Italy denies England its first major tournament win since the 1966 World Cup as it prevails on penalties. Luke Shaw scores the fastest ever goal in Euro final history after volleying home Kieran Trippier’s cross after just two minutes. Leonardo Bonucci levels the score midway through the second half off a corner. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka all miss decisive penalties in the defeat.\n#ESPNFC #EURO2020 #England #Italy\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
