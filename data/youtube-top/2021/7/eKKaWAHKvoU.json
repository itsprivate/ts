Here's What Happened\n\nFollow My Socials:\n• twitter: @SpeedSilverr\n• twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/speedsilver​​\n• discord: https://invite.gg/speedsilver​​​\n• tiktok: @SpeedSilver\n\nThis is a Minecraft Challenge in which I try to survive 100 Days, and I Shapeshift every day! There are also crazy Custom Shapeshifts like the Orangutang, Shark and the WARDEN. This is not a Minecraft Speedrunner VS Hunter, but a 'Minecraft 100 Days' challenge... This was completely insane.\n\nAlso, I had to play on 'Hard' difficulty instead of 'Hardcore' since the shapeshifter mod counted me shapeshifting as dying and deleted the world. Hopefully you guys understand!\n\n#100Days​​ #Hardcore​​ #Minecraft",
