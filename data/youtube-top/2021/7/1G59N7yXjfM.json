  "description": "Minecraft, But If You Laugh You Lose FINALE... This video is hilarious!\nMy friends have to do whatever they can to make me laugh. If they can make me laugh 3 times, they win. If I beat the game before they make me laugh 3 times, I win!\n\nThis was absolutely the funniest video ever.\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nKarl: @Karl \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nMy friends can use whatever they want to try and make me laugh... We have a plugin that allows them to put custom images onto maps which they can place into item frames so they can bring any image into Minecraft! This was super fun and crazy awesome!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
