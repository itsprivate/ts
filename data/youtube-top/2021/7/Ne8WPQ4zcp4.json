This was HILARIOUS!\nDownload Monster Legends now: https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/X4Sc/MrNotFound\n\nThis video, all the mobs in Minecraft try and take my friends and run away with them. I have to save them when they are captured and defend them while trying to beat the game. They can't attack mobs, only I can... This was one of the funnest/funniest challenges we've ever done!\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nSapnap: @Sapnap\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16/1.17 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
