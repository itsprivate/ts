  "description": "The Foundation has awoken, but not where you’d think. More info here:\nhttps://fn.gg/BatmanWhoLaughs\n\nYou may remember The Foundation at the bottom of the ocean, activating after a long slumber. But this ocean was not the Island’s. The Foundation has found himself in Gotham Harbor, where by fate’s workings (or a guiding force) he’s detected energy from the Zero Point.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins. ESRB Rating: Teen with Violence.\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fortnite/​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FortniteGame​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FortniteGame/​\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Fortnite\n\nLearn More: https://fortnite.com\n\n#thefoundation #batmanwholaughs",
