  "description": "BadBoyHalo and Foolish Compete against Skeppy in an epic Build Battle Challenge :D\n\nToday I am competing against BadBoyHalo and THE Professional Builder himself, FoolishG in another hilarious Build Battle Challenge!!! We built some pretty amazing things, like a Subway and even visited one in real life? I am a strong believer in second opinions, clearly. There was even drama in this video’s competition, with Foolish and Bad having some creative… differences? Things got intense LMAO. This video was so hilarious and fun to make so if you enjoyed this video hit it with a like and maybe I'll team up with Bad on the next one! Except no roller coasters this time because clearly railings are not Bad’s strength. \n\nSub to resident Minecraft artist @Foolish Gamers and I guess @BadBoyHalo \n\nMERCH: https://skeppyshop.com/\n\nFollow My Twitter - @Skeppy\nFollow My Instagram - @Skeppy\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen but it's BadBoyHalo being the angriest muffin we know",
