  "description": "Hey hey. Today I’m switching credit cards with Alisha Marie…omg. I’m so glad my first collab is with the queen of YouTube herself, and since she’s been on the platform for so long I know she’s got the coins. So I’m not going to be shy in the slightest. I rent a fancy car, go shopping on rodeo, and so much more but you’ll have to watch and see. Get your popcorn ready, or put your treadmills on a 12 incline because this is a good one. Who should I collab with next?! I’ll be chatting with y’all in the comments as usual \n\nWatch Alisha’s video and subscribe to her channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzU2P1JfEJM\n\nDONATE if you can!\nhttps://downtownwomenscenter.org\n\n\nMusic by ej hoffman - a onederpaul time - https://thmatc.co/?l=F098BF64\nMusic by Plastic Birds - Pretty Dress - https://thmatc.co/?l=CC72334B\nMusic by Ryan Little - For Hyrule! - https://thmatc.co/?l=70855C6C",
