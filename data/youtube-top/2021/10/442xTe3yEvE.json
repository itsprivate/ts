  "description": "Bloxorz is one of my favorite games that I used to play on Cool Math Games. When I was a kid, I never beat it a single time. But now, it's time to speedrun. Welcome to one of the most satisfying speedruns I've ever completed.\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the 33 level world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/F_vnlv5JgKI\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #Bloxorz #Speedrun",
