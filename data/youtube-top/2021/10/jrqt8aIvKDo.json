  "description": "Steak School: New York Strip (Strip Steak) ðŸ¥©\n\nThe NY Strip is an unappreciated cut. People love the ribeye for its flavor and the filet mignon for its tenderness, leaving the strip as an afterthought when it comes to prime cuts. The reality is that strip steaks are extremely balanced - IMO the perfect combination of the two. Most importantly is value. \n\nI often see New York strips 30%-50% cheaper than Filet or Ribeye counterparts. This allows the flexibility to move up a level in quality (ie Prime vs Choice or Wagyu vs Prime) without overspending. I would choose a Prime Strip (high marbling) over a Choice Ribeye (average marbling) any day of the week. \n.\n.\nðŸŽ¶ 1920 - HipHop Beats\n.\n.\n#nystrip #striploin #stripsteaks #carnivore #learnwithme #learning #steakschool\n\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”\nSUBSCRIBE and RING THE BELL to get notified when I post a video!\n\nPLATFORMS\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/maxthemeatguy/\n-TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@maxthemeatguy\n-Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MaxTheMeatGuy\n-YouTube: https://youtube.com/c/maxthemeatguy\n\nDISCOUNTS\nhttps://www.beacons.ai/maxthemeatguy\n\nWEBSITE\nhttps://www.maxthemeatguy.com/\n\nFILMED BY\nSophia Greb https://www.youtube.com/c/SophiaGreb\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”",
