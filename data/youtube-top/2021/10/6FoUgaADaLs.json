  "description": "The LA Lakers' opening night wasn't as smooth as they'd have liked. After leading for all three quarters, the wheels came off for LA in the fourth quarter as the Golden State Warriors went on to win 121-114. LeBron James and Anthony Davis both had over 30 points, but Russell Westbrook finished with only eight points in his Lakers' debut. Meanwhile, Steph Curry finished with a triple-double despite calling his own play quote: 'trash.' Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to the Lakers' loss despite big games from AD and LeBron.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #Lakers\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
