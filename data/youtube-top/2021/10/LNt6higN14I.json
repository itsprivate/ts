COLE VERSE] \nTurn around I wanna see (I wanna see)\nDo it look how it look on ig\nBad from every angle she got herself a trainer\nI know that nigga cant help be take a little peek\nCole world and Folarin co starring\nWe both flexing Bo Jacksons Bo Granden\nThese cap niggas that rap with piss poor jargon\nMy latest whip my latest chick was both foreign\nI know all my hoes miss me\nI been the shit since I hit elementary\nShe know who run it\nThe one that keep 100\nTo find a better nigga you gonna have to live a century\nevidently the coach can’t bench me\nThe franchise player\nI don’t know how to miss and they can’t buy a lay up\nI’m ain’t what they are\nI cant take my mind off your pants I swear\nGirl you shinning like a damn moncler\nI’m thinking we should dip like the Cam’ron era\nIf you the big steppa I’m the landmine here\nThat’s the one they know they can’t come near\n\n[HOOK]\n\n[VAMP]\nPoke it up I wanna\nSee you play weather you\nMeg the stallion or like Coi leray\nOKAY!",
