  "description": "Battlefield™ 2042 is available on November 19, 2021 with early access starting November 12, 2021.\n\nFrom Egypt’s giant wall to Singapore’s maze-like cargo containers, get your first look at gameplay on three of the seven maps coming at launch: Renewal, Breakaway and Discarded.\n\nThe maps in Battlefield 2042 allow for all-new gameplay experiences, with unprecedented scale and choices in gameplay. With the introduction of 128 players*, each map is specifically designed to provide a unique experience that directly impacts strategy for you and your squad. Battlefields have multiple distinct combat areas housed in a single playspace and this extra space means more variety and more meaningful vehicle gameplay.\nBattlefield 2042 is made up of three distinct multiplayer experiences – All-Out Warfare features the next generation of fan-favorite modes Conquest and Breakthrough; Battlefield™ Portal allows players to discover battles from the past, present and future as well as to creating and change the rules of war; while Battlefield™ Hazard Zone brings a tense, squad-focused survival experience. Adapt and overcome on dynamically-changing battlegrounds with the help of your squad and a cutting-edge arsenal.\n\nPre-order now for exclusive cosmetic items and more: http://x.ea.com/68944 \n\nFind out more about Battlefield: http://x.ea.com/68900\n\nSee the Battlefield 2042 Official Reveal Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASzOzrB-a9E\n\nSee the Battlefield 2042 Official Gameplay Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WomAGoEh-Ss \n\nSee the Battlefield Portal Official Trailer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4qWMcQfOCc\n\nSee the Battlefield 2042 Exodus Short Film\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVCfhLEYdo\n\nSee the Battlefield Hazard Zone Official Trailer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkMiPwL8G1w\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/battlefield\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/battlefield\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/battlefield\n\n#Battlefield #Battlefield2042 #WeAreNoPats\n*Supported on Xbox Series X|S, PC and PlayStation®5.
