  "description": "Learn more about Steam Deck and reserve yours at at http://steamdeck.com\n\nOne of the most frequently asked questions we've received about Steam Deck is about the components inside it, and whether they're replaceable or upgradable. The answer is a bit more complicated than just a yes or no, so we've made a video to explain all the details. Spoiler alert: we DON'T recommend replacing parts yourself, but we still want you to have all of the relevant information about Steam Deck's components. \n\nAnyway, this is the first public look at what's inside the device, so we hope you enjoy it. \n\nSee this update on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3011210954776539264\n\n--\nLi-ion battery video seen at 0:45 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24fYrV2vCPk",
