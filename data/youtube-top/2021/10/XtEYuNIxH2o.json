  "description": "After over a 10-year delay, The Don has stepped in the building and the long-awaited Big Sean freestyle appearance left no stone unturned. \n\nBig Sean dropped off a nearly nine-minute feat with nothing but factual bars in the new L.A. Leakers Freestyle 122. Sean wasted no time to bring awareness to not only the untold history of the Tuskegee experiment, to flexing his energy in rare form when he raps, “Sean, you been in love too long, it sound like all your hunger gone; I’m f***in’ starving’!” Sean continues his line, “ I saw a sunset on the way here, so colorful and vivid, reminded me that God my favorite artist. And, the fact I woke up today and saw it, reminded me that I’m winning regardless.”\n\nBig Sean didn’t stop there, as Justin Credible and DJ Sourmilk switched up the backing instrumental from Drake’s \"Love All\" to Kanye West’s “Hurricane.” \n\nCompletely BAR'D UP, Sean flipped the flow and went crazy over Nardo Wick’s “Who Want Smoke??”! The Detroit native also made sure to let y'all know that he and Hit-Boy have a classic on the way!\n\n\"Yo favorite rapper my f***kin’ doormat, look!\nI go at their necks and hearts\nThe sh*t you was building forever, I tear it apart\nMe, I’m a stepper for real, since from the beginning,\nI mean, I was born in March!\"\n\n#BigSean #Drake #NardoWick\nSubscribe Now - http://bit.ly/17Rrvxu\r\nPower 106 Website - http://bit.ly/THwnRX \r\nListen Live - http://bit.ly/T0chlq",
