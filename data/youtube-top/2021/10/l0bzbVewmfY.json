  "description": "Minecraft, But I Add A Marshmallow Every Minute... This was the most ridiculous Minecraft challenge ever!\n\nEvery minute that goes by, more marshmallows are added to my mouth and it gets harder to talk. All of the marshmallows made everything crazy...\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nQuackity: @Quackity \nKarl: @Karl \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16/1.17 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nThe goal of the challenge is to beat Minecraft, but every minute I have to put a marshmallow into my mouth. When the 1 minute timer ends, I have to stop whatever I'm doing to put the marshmallow in my mouth, even if I'm in a dangerous situation! This made the game way harder but it was still really fun!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
