  "description": "It’s everyone’s favorite time of year: nights grow long and dark with shadows, and the Legends dress up for the occasion...and reveal the Monsters Within.\n\nFight to conquer the new Encore Arenas map, while special event-limited cosmetic sets highlight the scary side of some of our most fearsome Legends like Revenant, Bloodhound, Caustic and Seer. On October 26, rediscover Shadow Royale, a different kind of Battle Royale where slain Legends respawn in a Shadow-Form to exact revenge and help living squadmates. Shadow lives are infinite, and your squad’s not eliminated until the last living Legend falls. \n\n\nApex Legends™ is a free-to-play hero shooter game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier. Play for free now on PlayStation® 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Origin and Steam.\n\nLearn more about Apex Legends: Emergence: http://x.ea.com/69275 \n \nCheck out our YouTube channel: http://x.ea.com/56710.\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/playapex.\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/playapex/.\n\n#ApexLegendsEmergence  #ApexLegendsMonstersWithin #ApexLegends",
