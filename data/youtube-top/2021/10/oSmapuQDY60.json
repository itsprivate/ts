  "description": "David Alaba’s first-half strike and Lucas Vasquez’s late goal see Real Madrid win 2-1 vs. Barcelona. Vinicius Jr. threatened early on for Real Madrid before Sergino Dest wasted a great chance to score for Barcelona. David Alaba then broke forward at speed and smashed home the opening goal just before halftime. Barcelona fought back well in the second half, but Real hit them on the break when Lucas Vazquez scored in injury time. Sergio Aguero grabbed his first Barcelona goal in the 97th minute, but it was too little. too late for the home side.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
