  "description": "There was a big surprise this week at Cerro Gordo. What started off as a casual Friday turned into a historic day thanks to a surprise visit from Heavy D and Diesel Dave. They dropped off a military 5-ton truck that is going to be huge for moving materials for the town. We also ended up going 900 ft down into the Union Mine, which also came with all sorts of surprises!\n\nMore behind the scenes photos: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nThank you for your support and for subscribing.
