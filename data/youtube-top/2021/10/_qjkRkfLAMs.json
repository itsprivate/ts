  "description": "🔥SHOP NOW!!🔥━► https://www.teamrar.com/ \n\nCarter Sharer and Team RAR just did the One Color iPhone Drop Test Challenge (https://youtu.be/r3-T3wB6ap8) But today, we're doing a special video for #TeamSeas as Carter Sharer, Lizzy Capri, Deniesse, and Andrew do the ultimate Last to Leave Jet Skis challenge!! And whether you ride in a lake or in the sea, it's important to have clean waters which is why we're proud to join Mr Beast along with countless other creators to help clean up our waters. And to do that, Carder woke Liz up by tying a rope to her air mattress and hooking it to the end of a John Deer golf cart, then giving her an unexpected ride in the lake!! Deniesse also got a similar awakening when her air mattress became an impromptu water bed!! Who do you think won fair and square?? What would you use for the drop test??
