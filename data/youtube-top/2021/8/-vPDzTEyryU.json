However, the twist is that there are custom biomes. This is a \"Minecraft, But\" challenge, not beating minecraft but my friend tries to stop me AKA Minecraft Speedrunner VS Hunter AKA Minecraft Manhunt, Minecraft UHC, Minecraft PvP, nor Minecraft SMP. :L\n\n#MinecraftBut #MinecraftChallenge #Minecraft #TapL",
