  "description": "In the video above, Alexander Stockton, a producer on the Opinion Video team, explores two of the main reasons the number of Covid cases is soaring once again in the United States: vaccine hesitancy and refusal.\n\n“It’s hard to watch the pandemic drag on as Americans refuse the vaccine in the name of freedom,” he says.\n\nSeeking understanding, Mr. Stockton travels to Mountain Home, Ark., in the Ozarks, a region with galloping contagion and — not unrelated — abysmal vaccination rates.\n\nHe finds that a range of feelings and beliefs underpins the low rates — including fear, skepticism and a libertarian strain of defiance.\n\nThis doubt even extends to the staff at a regional hospital, where about half of the medical personnel are not vaccinated — even while the intensive care unit is crowded with unvaccinated Covid patients fighting for their lives.\n\nMountain Home — like the United States as a whole — is caught in a tug of war between private liberty and public health. But Mr. Stockton suggests that unless government upholds its duty to protect Americans, keeping the common good in mind, this may be a battle with no end.\n\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.
