  "description": "Every time my Friend Looks Away.. I add a Custom Mod w/ Doni Bobes - Minecraft\n\nIn todays video I decided to troll my Friend @Liger by slowly adding mods until he notices. I give him a minecraft egg and every time he picks it up it kicks him from the server and I quickly add a mod to the server. I add some crazy mods but as soon as he notices the video is over!\n\n🎮 MY SERVER IP 🡆 PLAY.SKYBLOCKNETWORK.COM\n\n👀 Subscribe to my OTHER CHANNEL!\n🡆 https://www.youtube.com/c/DoniMinecraft\n\n😁 FOLLOW ME HERE!\n🡆 Twitter: www.twitter.com/Donibobes\n🡆 Facebook: www.facebook.com/donibobes\n🡆 Instagram: https://instagram.com/donibobes\n🔊 Discord: http://www.discord.gg/doni\n💜 Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/donibobes\n🎵 TikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@doni.bobes\n\n👕 MERCH\n🡆 http://donibobes.shop\n\n🎥 MY EDITOR \n🡆 @Jeardz \n\nIF YOU'RE READING THIS...\n👉 LIKE AND SUB PLS\n\nMUSIC USED 🡆 All by Kevin Macleod at http://incompetech.com",
