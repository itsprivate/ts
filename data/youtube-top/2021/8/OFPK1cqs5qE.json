(Small one) or about a cup of chopped onion\n2 eggs\n2 dry cups (16oz)of Grapenuts cereal\n\nCombine all ingredients- may need to use hands (clean!), then incorporate the sauce:\nMix 1 cup maple syrup, 1 cup ketchup and 2 Tablespoons of mustard. Pour half into meat mixture, save half for top.\n\nSpray pan with oil or butter- use a baking pan or skillet that is oven proof (handle must also be oven proof not plastic)\n\nPut mixture in and spread evenly. Poke holes with handle of wooden spoon or similar and pour rest of sauce over meat. \n\nBake for about an hour. If you have convection bake it may cook in about 40 minutes. \n\nRoyalty Free Music by \nhttp://www.epidemicsound.com/\nOutro: Pls Proceed by Baron Grand",
