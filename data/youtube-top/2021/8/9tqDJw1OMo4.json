  "description": "An emotional Lionel Messi has revealed he expected to extend his stay at Barcelona, but is now a free agent after financial issues at the Catalan club left them unable to pay the Argentinian’s wages. Speaking at his farewell press conference on Sunday morning, a tearful Messi said: 'This year, my family and I were convinced we were going to stay at home, that’s what we all wanted more than anything.'\n\n'We’d always made this our own, we were at home. We thought we would be staying here in Barcelona. But today, we have to say goodbye to all of this.'",
