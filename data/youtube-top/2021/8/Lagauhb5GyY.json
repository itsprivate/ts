  "description": "The marriage of Princess Diana and Prince Charles has long since grown cold. Though rumors of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at the Queen’s Sandringham Estate. There's eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. But this year, things will be \rprofoundly different. SPENCER is an imagining of what might have happened during those few fateful days.\r\r\n\nDirected by Pablo Larraín\n\rWritten by Steven Knight \nStarring Kristen Stewart, Timothy Spall, Jack Farthing, Sean Harris, Sally Hawkins",
