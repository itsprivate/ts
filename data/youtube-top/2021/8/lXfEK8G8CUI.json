Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. \n\nIt is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer. It's so manifold that it is impossible to cover in one video, so we’ll make a series looking at different aspects of it. \n\nToday, what happens when your body is invaded and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and death?\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nEmergence\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3jEvquO\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/2X30D2X\nLife\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3CBAybK\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/37xr4ju\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nBBumbrazz, Sir Harry Farr, Abigail von Kelsch, Szabolcs Dombi, Conner Wilson, Enoch, Moody Bastard, Diego Marcheselli, Paxton LaRiviere, Richard Hagen, Robin Harn, Izzy Crow, Kristy Evangelista, Michael Baker, Tuna The Fish, @charlievankamp, Calvin Black, Justin Fisher, Jan Hübler, Anshul Choudhry, garshtoshteles, Mark Moses, Mau Magaña, seasar2000, Toda, newline, Matt, schubadu, Slumperd, Cracker, Josh Carpenter, Benedikt S., Jeti, Kevin Williams, Enrique Mejia, Juan Carlos Coto Sanchez, Paulmega, Jasmeet Singh, Austin Daily, Andrew Bourgeois, Andrew Dawson, Fin Brewin, Graesha Lizardo, Hagen, Diogo Moreno, Madeline McKinnon, akshay niranjan, The Entity, sontino catalano, Aubrey Temple, Terone, Oleksandr Bolgarov, Jacob Bell, Kyle Harmse, Henry Angulo, Luka Dulčić, mors741, Billyboots75, Joe Bedell, Merasmus 2.0, jimmy davies, PBYuki-Onna, Billy Z Duke",
