  "description": "The Story of Minecraft. You may find yourself wondering where the villages and temples of the Minecraft world came from? Well today we go over the INSANE history of how all of the Minecraft's worlds structures came to be, and what happened before we joined the world. \n\nHELP ME HIT 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS BEFORE THE END OF 2021!\n\nTwitch: SipoverS\n\nTwitter: SipoverS\n\nInstagram: SipoverS \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/qFrX5Qb\n\nNot the entire history of minecraft, i guess, or even Minecraft's Most Unbelievable Seeds and Minecraft's History on Youtube, or Minecraft's Mindblowing Inventions, which are all other videos made by Sipover Minecraft Youtuber. Dream and Tommyinnit should mention the history of minecraft and the story next time they see a village in their manhunt minecraft mod videos. \n\nPrince: Mcyum\nKing: Mcyum\nGuard: Mcyum",
