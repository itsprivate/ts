  "description": "Hello friends! So, previously we have tested out many a bizarre hack video -- from beauty hacks, to fashion hacks, to photo/video hacks AND soap art hacks -- from Blossom, 5 Minute Crafts, and others -- and in general, I have not been impressed. BUT, a couple of months ago when I stumbled upon these beautiful CANDLE art hacks -- I fell in love. These are the coolest candles I've ever seen and I needed to have them. So we decided to pick out a few key candle art hacks and see if they are just pure clickbait, or if you can actually make any of these crafts IRL. We tried a margarita jelly candle hack, a whipped wax latte candle hack, and a wax cherry blossom tree hack. What do you guys think of our final products??\n\nWhat do you guys think of these soap hacks??\n\nYou can check out the Blossom videos that contain our hacks here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25tCwqjnjro\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZNGuk5wMR8\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington",
