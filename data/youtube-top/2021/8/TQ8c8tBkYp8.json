  "description": "One person has died as Hurricane Ida, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US, knocked out power to all of New Orleans, reversed the flow of the Mississippi River and blew roofs off buildings across Louisiana. Across the state, more than a million households were without power, and the outage in New Orleans had left the city more vulnerable to flooding – 16 years after Hurricane Katrina caused devastation. \nNew Orleans battered by Hurricane Ida as storm claims first victim in Louisiana \nHurricane Ida live updates: first death in Louisiana as New Orleans loses power",
