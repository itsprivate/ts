Well Carder Sharer had to do the 100 mystery button challenge because of the Gold Digger prank on Lizzy Capri, then Lizzy and Bailey Bagles Payne got Carter back with the UNDERWATER 100 mystery button challenge, and finally Carer got Lizzy back with the 100 mystery buttons but every button is slime!! Well today Cartre is giving Team RAR's Matt Braeden a taste of the challenge, literally! We made this frosty challenge as tasty as possible, except for the Spinach and fart flavors! Plus as always, there's a secret weapon Andrew and Carter prepared that Matt wasn't ready for!! What 100 Mystery Button box should we do next??
