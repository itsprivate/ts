  "description": "There are a lot of similarities between the two storms. WFAA meteorologist Jessie Hawila compares them.\nMany people are drawing comparisons between Ida and Katrina. Eerily enough, they're expected to share the same date of landfall. Katrina was August 29, 2005 and Ida will make landfall August 29, 2021. While there are tons of similarities to be found, subtle differences between the two could make a big difference in what happens in New Orleans.\n\nThe storm surge with Hurricane Ida is expected to be extreme and life-threatening. Some parts of the Louisiana coast could see storms surge of 10-15 feet. \n\nMORE: https://www.wfaa.com/article/weather/severe-weather/what-is-storm-surge-how-will-hurricane-ida-compare-to-hurricane-katrina/287-8a42f82a-1919-4e6b-b2a1-7a5bdf1ec38a",
