  "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! So for a bit of a throwback video, this week I'm going to be showing you guys some long-lost footage from our East Asia trip in 2019, where we went shopping at 8 different vintage stores in 3 different countries. \n\nNow 2 years ago, we went on a trip to East Asia for three weeks, to visit Tokyo, Seoul, and Hong Kong to explore beauty & fashion trends, different shopping experiences, and cheese. \n\nAnd while we were there, I thought it would be cool to visit a couple of vintage clothing stores in each location to see how they compare to each other, as well as how they compare to vintage stores back in the US. And also of course to gather myself an international vintage clothing haul. What do you guys think??\n\nRinRin's channel: https://www.youtube.com/rinrindolljapan (English channel) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/RinRinDolly (Japanese channel)\nHojuSara's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/seoulsarang9095\nTinyTip's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg2NkfLad1SdlJ76zfUzKEw\nTaylor R's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TaylorR1488\n\nYou can find more from the stores here!\nKinsella - https://www.instagram.com/kinsellatokyo/ \nDog Harajuku - https://www.instagram.com/p/CTE4gIXpxWB/ \nPunk Cake - https://www.instagram.com/punk_cake/  \nHantage - https://www.instagram.com/hantage_official/ \nRing My Button - https://www.instagram.com/ringmybutton_official/ \nVintage Bonnie - https://www.instagram.com/vintage.bonnie/ \nMee & Gee - https://www.facebook.com/meegeeco (https://www.instagram.com/meegee_co/)\nMidwest Vintage - https://www.instagram.com/midwestvintage/  \n\nResources to learn more about what's been going on in Hong Kong -\nBBC articles about 2019 protests & beyond:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c95yz8vxvy8t/hong-kong-anti-government-protests\n\nVox borders videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG4vTyZ8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_RdnVtfZPY\n\nAlso, all of this footage was filmed in 2019, pre-lockdown, so that's why we are flying around & not wearing masks!
