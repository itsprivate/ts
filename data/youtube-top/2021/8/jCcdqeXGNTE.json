  "description": "What if there was a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them. Over the past few days, Here's How I became the Richest Minecraft Player on an Entire Minecraft SMP... and it's known as the LifeSteal SMP\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not AJTHEBOLD / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea / challenge where you can steal SMP Minecraft player's lives. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is a thing. \n\nOther LifeSteal SMP: @Spoke @rekrap2@roshambogames@ClownPierce @Leowook @TheTerrain @ashswag @Yeah Jaron \n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/5brGq79Sjg\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!",
