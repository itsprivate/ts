Including a Cotton Candy Lizzy's Lounge, Ryan Prunty's Magic Throne, Bailey's Parkour Castle, Carter's Green Pyramid, Lego Larry (any OG fans remember??) and a TEAM RAR jail. Who could that be for?? Plus we found out that Matt Braeden called in sick, but he was secretly in Hawaii?! It was smooth sailing for Andrew and Carter until we noticed a police helicopter flying around the Team RAR mansion!! What do you think they were looking for??
