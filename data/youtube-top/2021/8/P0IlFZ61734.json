  "description": "Sister of Shapes, Sword-Breaker, Witch Queen – which of my many names lives on your lips as you weave your story around me? Even as you tread carefully through my courtyard, among those who worship the Light I have gifted, would you deny me the virtue of this power? \nYour answers are telling, Guardian. Ponder them and question those who promise you clarity in the face of all you see here. Listen as their voice wavers. And as you lift your new steel from the heart of your forge, ask yourself, “What force wields you?” \nI await you, Guardian. Step into my Throne World and behold the truth. \nLearn more: http://bung.ie/witchqueen\n\nFOLLOW DESTINY:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DestinyTheGame\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/destinythegame\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/destinythegame\nDiscord: http://www.discord.gg/destinygame\n \nFOLLOW BUNGIE:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Bungie/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/bungie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bungie/\n⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀\nDive into the free-to-play world of Destiny 2 to experience responsive first-person shooter combat, explore the mysteries of our solar system, and unleash elemental abilities against powerful enemies.
