  "description": "Get Your BRAND NEW Back to School Theory Wear! ► https://bit.ly/3loC36U\n\nWhen Team Salvato announced there Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, my theory brain started preparing. I knew this new DLC-esk game would have SOMETHING hiding in it and, oh boy, was I right. I previously theorized about another game being hinted at in Yuri's novel when of the original game. Now, I wasn't wrong, but I had apparently only scratched the SURFACE of what was going on with the strange thing called Project Libitina. Theorists, we are ALL a part of this game! \n\nFind the game here ► https://ddlc.plus/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Catch all the Theories! ► https://goo.gl/kQWHkJ        \n\nNeed Royalty Free Music for your Content?
