  "description": "Skeppy vs BadBoyHalo Underwater Building Competition\n  \nToday BadBoyHalo and I face off in an Underwater Building Competition!!! We have 30 minutes to get the BEST build underwater, seriously, we can do WHATEVER we want we just have to do it underwater. Honestly, I always win these so it's no surprise that this was so easy for me. I found the perfect space for my house, Bad is going to be SO jealous. You may have to watch me struggle with glass for a little bit but it's fine, it's fine, everything is fine. I'm really going for more of a modern home feel with a hot tub and big TV, the works, you'll see what I mean. Bad tries to create a \"hollow sphere\" or whatever that means? And then he crashes the server to try and sabotage me? I try and be fancy one time in my life... Bad's place actually turned out pretty cute not gonna lie. These videos with Bad are always so fun to make so if you enjoyed please hit this video with a like and we'll do more fun challenges like these :D\n\nFollow My Twitter - @Skeppy\n\nFollow My Instagram - @Skeppy\n  \nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of the Ultimate Minecraft Underwater Building Challenge\n\nalso..maybe.. sub to @BadBoyHalo",
