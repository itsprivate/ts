  "description": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona had their backs against the wall once again in the Copa del Rey facing a two-goal deficit for much of their quarterfinal vs. Granada. The hosts went in front with goals from Robert Kenedy and Roberto Soldado. Barca left its comeback late with goals in the 88th minute and stoppage time from Antoine Griezmann and Jordi Alba. The game went to extra time where the two sides traded goals from Griezmann and Fede Vico, but in the second extra time period Alba and Frenkie de Jong seal the victory for the Blaugrana. Barcelona advances to the Copa del Rey semifinals for the 10th time in the last 11 seasons, with its only elimination before the semis coming last season.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
