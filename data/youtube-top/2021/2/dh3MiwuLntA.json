  "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.\n\nNPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.\n\n\"Just bear with me while I just enjoy this and soak in it,\" GIVĒON admits with a laugh. Switching between the demeanors of a seasoned, nonchalant crooner and a giddy-grinned newbie, the fast-rising R&B star makes a point to show his humility during his long-awaited debut at Tiny Desk.\n\nAccompanied by a minimal, masked-up band and only one background vocalist (a fellow Pisces at that), the baby-face baritone fills the set with resonance and light. He radiates gratitude with every note. Against a blue, moody backsplash of projected music video stills, GIVĒON notes the divine timing of this performance. \"Any moment to do this would be special,\" he says between songs, \"but I think Black History Month ... just celebrating Black culture for this month, I'm really excited to get to do this on this platform.\"\n\nThrough the throes of the pandemic, GIVĒON has remained remarkably busy. In a span of eight months, the Long Beach, Calif. newcomer has released two solid EPs, the Grammy-nominated Take Time and When It's All Said And Done. (The latter included one of our favorite songs of 2020, \"Still Your Best.\") For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he borrows from each project to arrange a tantalizing 14-minute sampler — showing off just enough to get you to do your Googles and discover more.\n\nMuch like the moment he's trying to savor, GIVĒON's strength as a singer-songwriter is his ability to make his listener feel suspended in time. As fans quickly discovered on his breakthrough \"Chicago Freestyle\" feature last year, the peaks and valleys of GIVĒON's tone and the satisfying patterns of his runs don't just serenade; They immerse, they engulf. GIVĒON's star rising during a time of such sustained uncertainty is no accident, either. Between vulnerable storytelling and clear vocals, GIVĒON's work provides so many with what they're craving right now: intimacy and consistency.\n\nSET LIST\n\"THE BEACH\"\n\"LIKE I WANT YOU\"\n\"Stuck On You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGIVĒON: vocals\nDeondre Ellis: keys\nIvan Chatman: bass\nAndre Montgomery: drums\nJames Murray: guitar\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jan Lim, Mitchell Schultz, Will Houlihan\nProducer: Zack Warren\nDirector: Eric Longden\nAudio: Jeremy Gray, Reggie Jones, Al Richardson\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",
