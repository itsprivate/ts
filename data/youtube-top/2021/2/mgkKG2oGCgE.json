  "description": "Annoying customers are annoying. These are times I met the most notable customers and shoppers when I worked at the UPS store. I thought working in food jobs would be worse but I think I had a worse time in the UPS store. Looking back now I think it was funny. In the moment though it was less of that and more annoying. Crazy customers be crazy. And I imagine people working in retail now have even crazier stories from the past year. My stories are from years ago.\n\n\n\nVilla helped with this animation and did a really good job here is their twitter account: https://twitter.com/hi_blnd\n\n\nthanks for watching ‚ù§Ô∏è see you next video.\n\n(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)\nüì± twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\nüì∑ instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
