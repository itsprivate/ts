  "description": "James Charles plays Roblox with me and it was the funniest thing ever\nFULL STREAM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYt0NF0MHsM&\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/Quackity\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Quackity\nSTEAM: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quackity\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/quackityhq\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/quackity/\n\nJames Charles is a beauty youtuber who possibly does not play minecraft nor roblox for a living because he does not do roblox nor minecraft for a living, that's just my guess. So today it is my duty to make James Charles experience the alike games of minecraft and roblox, but more specifically roblox because he probably already tried minecraft but I'll show him minecraft too if he wants I can definitely do that and teach him to play minecraft or roblox that would be very funny.\n\nPrimarily Edited: https://youtube.com/wheatskin",
