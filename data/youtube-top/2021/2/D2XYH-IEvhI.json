  "description": "Jeep® kicks off Game Day by reminding us we are stronger than the obstacles in our way, and invites us to remember all the ways we are connected as Americans. A timeless CJ-5 takes us on a journey to the U.S. Center Chapel in Kansas in search of common ground. We have spanned deserts and climbed the highest peaks. We can cross this divide. #JeepTheMiddle\n\n\n\nFor 80 years, the Jeep® name has been indelibly associated with freedom, authenticity, adventure and passion. These are vehicles for “dreamers and doers” - forging extraordinary, uncommon bonds between themselves and their owners, because adventure is found in every Jeep® vehicle’s DNA. The Jeep® badge stands for more than a brand. In truth, it’s a badge of honor.\n\nSubscribe to the #Jeep​ brand YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/Jeep​ \n\nFollow The Jeep® brand on Social: \n· Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/jeep​ \n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/jeep​ \n· Instagram: https://instagram.com/jeep​",
