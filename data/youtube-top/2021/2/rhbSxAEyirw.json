  "description": "Despite being an underdog, Tom Brady won his 7th Super Bowl in his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Tampa controlled most of the game and never gave up the lead after going up 7 to 3. Brady finished with 3 touchdowns and just over 200 passing yards in the win. Patrick Mahomes couldn’t get the Kansas City Chiefs' offense moving and threw 2 picks without finding the endzone once. Hear what Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe have to say about Tom Brady's impressive win over the Chiefs.\n\n#Undisputed #NFL #TomBrady #PatrickMahomes #Buccaneers #Chiefs #SuperBowlLV\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
