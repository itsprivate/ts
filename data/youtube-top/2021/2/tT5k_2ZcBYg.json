(Oh, oh, Lil Boat)\nWhy you gotta act up?\nWhy you gotta try so hard every day, though?\nI don't fuck with you in that way, though\nWhy you such an asshole?\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]\nA-S-S-H-O-L-E\nBut if you go broke, don't you dare go call me\nI tried so hard just to make you love me\nSmile in my face when I know you're phony\nPlay it so cool, but you got me anxious\nSkin like gold, but your heart so dangerous\nIf I am not him, why don't you just tell me?\nTried to pay for your love, but you just won't sell me\nLost in love\nI shouldn't wanna chase you no more\nI can't really take it no more\nHonestly, your energy is poor\nPiss poor, piss poor\nIt's like you don't care anymore\nHow did I not notice this before?\n\n[Chorus: Oliver Tree & Lil Yachty]\nWhy you such an asshole?\nWhy you gotta act up?\nWhy you gotta try so hard every day, though? (Every day)\nI don't fuck with you in that way, though (No)\nWhy you such an asshole?\n\n#LilYacthy #OliverTree #Asshole",
