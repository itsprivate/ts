Today we recap the events and talk about the larger implications, although there are most certainly many ramifications of this story that have yet to surface.\n\n\n------------------------------\nSOURCES:\n\n\nInteresting piece on how the stock market is being manipulated:\nhttps://bit.ly/3kh4G39 \n\n\nOn short selling, Tesla and Gamestop:\nhttps://on.mktw.net/3qMwkaJ \n\nMost heavily shorted stocks in January of 2021:\nhttps://bit.ly/2ZJMS7q \n\n\nHedge funds losing billions of dollars:\nhttps://bit.ly/2MkFIna \n\n\nRobinhood capital infusion:\nhttps://on.ft.com/3usvG4H \n\n\n------------------------------\nCREDITS:\n\nAndrei Terbea - Lead Animator\n\nStefan Popa - Assistant Animator\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jtefe.ro/\n\nNicoleta Toader - Producer\n\n------------------------------\nMUSIC:\n\nBackground track:  \"Delusional (Instrumental)\" by Spring Gang\nOutro song: Joakim Karud - \"Loudness & Clarity\"\nhttp://youtube.com/joakimkarud\n\n\n------------------------------\n#GameStop #Reddit #WallStreetBets",
