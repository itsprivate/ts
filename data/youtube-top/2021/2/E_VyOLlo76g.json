  "description": "After running out of hairspray, a Louisiana woman coated her hair with Gorilla Glue spray, a strong adhesive normally used to bond materials like metal, wood and stone. Tessica Brown went viral on social media after explaining the sticky situation and the regret that followed. Brown spoke to Inside Edition about her struggle to try and remove it. She tried baby oil, cooking oil and olive oil to try and remove the glue, but nothing worked. So she sought medical treatment at her local emergency room in Louisiana, but couldn’t tolerate the burning of the acetone wipes they gave her.",
