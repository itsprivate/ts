  "description": "🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\nThis week, I traveled to the beautiful country of Iraq.  All my life I'd heard of the war in Iraq and how dangerous it was to visit, but I wanted to go there and explore if for myself to hear the stories that didn't make it into the media.  So, along with Drew Binsky, Lexie Alford and Cory Martin, we were taken around Iraqi Kurdistan by our amazing guide, Baderkhan.\n\n✈ Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Yes Theory Plus: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTd7KzdwnFE3lm6LCfYDmUQ\n📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.
