The Show features Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more. Every week we will be doing Wandavision breakdowns, easter egg videos, theories and ending explaineds so definitely stick around. We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\nWelcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who's breakdowns you watch whilst you wait for New Rockstars to upload theirs and this video we have a lot to talk about.\n\nEpisode 7 of Wandavision brings a lot with it and we pick up in the aftermath of Wanda expanding the Hex after she lost her Vision like daredevil. The malcolm in the middle esque entry had Vision saying you're not the boss of me now and the cliffhanger showed SWORD for the clowns they really are. Episode 7 evolves the two storylines in many ways and there's a lot to unpack from the entry.\n\nAs always I'm gonna be discussing some of the more general aspects of the episode up top but if you wanna SPEED through the video then timecodes are linked below.\n\nNow firstly I wanna dicuss Billy and Tommy which just so happens to be the name of both my grandfathers.\n\nIt's all connected.\n\nIt's clear that the characters are becoming Wiccan and Speed and thus I feel this is the best episode to give you the 411 on who they really are. Originally in the comics the twins were introduced as Wanda's Children in the graphic novel Vision and The Scarlett Witch. This book followed the pair as they made a life in New Jersey but there was a twist in the tale. Because Vision was unable to have children, Wanda unwittingly used fragments of Mephisto's soul to give life to them and they were eventually reabsorbed by the villain.\n\nHowever the pair were brought back and they were reincarnated under surrogate parents to become the mutants that we all know and love.\n\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n► Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
