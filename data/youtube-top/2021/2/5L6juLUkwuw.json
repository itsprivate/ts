  "description": "We love the big game. The rivalries. The drama. The build-up. The athleticism. The sportsmanship. The ads. For the last eight years, T-Mobile’s gone big for the big game – Bieber, Tebow, Harvey, Drake, Snoop & Martha, Handler & Silverman, Anthony & Mama Doris and even a Kardashian. But we’ve never been banned. Until now.\n\nWe made this amazing ad starring the amazing Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski. Even after editing, the spot was still banned “based on the ... protected telco rights deal.\" So, watch and decide for yourself ... what does the “official telco sponsor” not want you to see? \n\nWatch more about T-Mobile & 5G: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YFNfVP0_00&list=PL0mz2nejZ-Dga0kemLGCEXlR08WDFfXfY\n\nMore about New T-Mobile & our 5G network: https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/4g-lte-5g-networks\n\nLearn more about 5G and how it works: https://www.t-mobile.com/5g\n\nSubscribe to the T-Mobile YouTube channel and be the first to watch our new videos!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/tmobile?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCan't get enough of T-Mobile?
