  "description": "Minecraft, But Advancements Give OP Items...\n\nFollow My Socials:\n• twitter: @SpeedSilverr\n• twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/speedsilverr​\n• discord: https://invite.gg/speedsilver​\n• tiktok: @SpeedSilver\n\nBTW I know @Bionic also had the same video idea with his \"Minecraft, But Every Advancement Gives You OP Items...\" video, but I recorded this a couple weeks ago and he's completely cool with using the same idea!\n\nThis is a Minecraft Challenge in which I try to beat the game, but the world updates every 10 minutes, this idea was inspired by  @Wisp's \"Minecraft but Fire Drops OP Items\" video, except I put my own twist on it!\n\n#Minecraft #MinecraftBut #MinecraftChallenge",
