  "description": "Demi Lovato wants to set the record straight in her upcoming YouTube docuseries, \"Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil,\" which explores what really happened during her near-fatal overdose in 2018. She told Ellen she hopes the series will help others going through similar problems, and acknowledged we can all learn from people who overcome their darkest struggles, as even role models can make mistakes. The Grammy nominee also divulged how she feels more authentic with a short haircut, and shared what it was like to perform on Inauguration Day. She also detailed the time she unexpectedly went skydiving on a second date.\n\n#DemiLovato\n#TheEllenShow\n#Ellen",
