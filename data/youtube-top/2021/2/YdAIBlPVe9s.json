  "description": "Disney and Pixar invite you to experience a summer like never before. Luca arrives June 2021.\n\nSet in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar’s original feature film “Luca” is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water’s surface. Directed by Academy Award® nominee Enrico Casarosa (“La Luna”) and produced by Andrea Warren (“Lava,” “Cars 3”), “Luca” releases Summer 2021.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/pixarluca/\nhttps://twitter.com/pixarluca\nhttp://facebook.com/pixarluca\nHashtag: #PixarLuca",
