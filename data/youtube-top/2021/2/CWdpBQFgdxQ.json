  "description": "Society fears what it cannot understand. Experience the power of The Nevers, a new @HBO original series, this April on @HBOmax.\n\nIn the last years of Victoria’s reign, London is beset by the “Touched”: people — mostly women — who suddenly manifest abnormal abilities, some charming, some very disturbing. Among them are Amalia True (Laura Donnelly), a mysterious, quick-fisted widow, and Penance Adair (Ann Skelly), a brilliant young inventor. They are the champions of this new underclass, making a home for the Touched, while fighting the forces of… well, pretty much all the forces — to make room for those whom history as we know it has no place. #HBO #TheNevers\nSubscribe to HBO on YouTube: https://goo.gl/wtFYd7\n\nStream on HBO Max: http://itsh.bo/hbo-max\n\nGet More HBO\nOfficial Site: https://itsh.bo/dotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hbo\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hbo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hbo\n\nThe Nevers: Official Teaser | HBO",
