He has introduced me to all sorts of new creatures and I am fortunate to have met him. \nhttp://www.instagram.com/nomadic_nostoc\n\nKita Williams reached out to me almost a year ago with her amazing Tardigrade footage, and I am so happy that she did. She has a knack for capturing these animals in way that gives them so much personality!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SeaSpongeCake\n\nBob Goldstein runs a lab at UNC Chapel Hill and has done incredible work on the Tardigrade (and much more.) He was kind enough to review my work to make sure I didn't screw the science up too much! I wish I could have included more of his work on the evolution of Tardigrades - but I hope to do that in a future episode on arthropods.\nhttps://goldsteinlab.weebly.com/\n\nThank you to the following for publishing their images\runder the CC license, it is a huge contribution to \rscience communication.\n\nWater bear (tardigrade), Hypsibius dujardini, \rscanning electron micrograph by \rBob Goldstein and Vicky Madden.\r\r\nScanning electron micrograph of active hydrated \rEchiniscoides sigismundi by Thomas L.
