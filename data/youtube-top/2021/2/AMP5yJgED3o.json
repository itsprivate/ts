The Show is rumored to feature Mephisto, Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more.

We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\n0:00 Episode 5 Intro\n0:34 Avengers Endgame Post Credits Scene\n1:22 Vision And The Scarlett Witch Graphic Novel\n2:04 Agnes Theories And Clues\n3:34 Episode 5 Sitcom Influences\n5:03 Wandavision Episode 5 Breakdown\n18:04 Wandavision Episode 6 Spoilers And Leaks\n\nOk so Episode 4 ended with us finding out that Scarlett Witch was doing a weekend at Wanda's with Visions dead corpse. It was a mindblowing moment that set her up as the big bad but throughout the season there's been several clues that something more sinister is going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but as always Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who Jimmy Woos you with my card tricks now let's get into the biggidy biggidy breakdown.\n\nNow as always things are time coded below if you wanna skip ahead but as is usual with our breakdowns we're gonna be discussing some key theories up top.\n\nIf you've been keeping up to date with the behind the scenes stuff on the show then you'll know that the showrunner Jac Schaeffer revealed that Wandavision actually takes place almost immediately after Endgame and before the events of Far From Home.\n\nIf you checked out our video last week then you'll has seen us discussing an interview with Paul Bettany in which he revealed that Endgame originally had a post credits scene that set up the events of the show. It was supposed to close out with Wanda going to see Vision's body which was being kept in a drawer and we can see why this was cut as it happens at one point in the episode.\n\nVision actually didn't want to be brought back to life but Wanda doing this shows that she has completely broken his trust.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n► Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
