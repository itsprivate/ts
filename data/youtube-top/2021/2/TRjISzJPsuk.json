  "description": "📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n\nAfter five and a half years as a host on this channel, I've decided to step away. 'Thank You' are the only two words I can muster. You, this community, have shown me nothing but endless love and support. The video goes into detail about my decision.\n\nI'll be writing a short newsletter twice a month at www.yestheory.com/newsletter. This is the newsletter I wish my 19 year old self had when I first set out to live a fulfilling life. When you sign you'll receive lessons, tips and tricks from ten years of seeking discomfort.\n\nI'll also be working on the book which will come out in November of this year...but more on that later.\n\nCome follow along on the ride. We're only just getting started :)\n\nAlso, make sure to wait till the end to watch our EPIC season trailer. \n\nLove you all,\n\nMatt\n\n🎬  Matt’s Best Moments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yw6EPr6jJM\n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Yes Theory Plus: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTd7KzdwnFE3lm6LCfYDmUQ\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\nIf you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.
