What hidden details in Pietro's cameo begin to explain what's really going on with this apparent X-Men crossover? Erik Voss breaks down all the Easter Eggs you missed, including the mysterious red glow throughout the episode, Monica Rambeau's interesting history with Captain Marvel, a possible Fantastic Four reference, the even-darker backstory behind Sparky the dog, and what this episode tells us about other X-Men like Magneto, Professor X, Wolverine, or Deadpool appearing in the MCU.\n\nNew Rockstars supports efforts to end racial violence.
