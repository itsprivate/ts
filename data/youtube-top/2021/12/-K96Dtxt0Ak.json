  "description": "Watch as Marines surprise this World War Two veteran.\n\nWhen Marines arrived in Port Everglades for Fleet Week, the local sheriff informed them that there was a true war hero who lived nearby, and that he had a very particular problem the Marines might be able to help him with. \n\nThe man was a Marine aviator who piloted planes in World War Two and had over a hundred combat missions in the Korean War. Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. \n\nCaptain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.",
