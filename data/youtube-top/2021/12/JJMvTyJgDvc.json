  "description": "Today we completely break Cuphead speedruns by using the Mugman Army glitch. This glitch allows us to spawn unlimited Mugman clones, and can results in some extremely fast fights. This speedrun is one of my favorites\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record run here: https://youtu.be/WOvPL91CKTc\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nThis speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #Speedrun",
