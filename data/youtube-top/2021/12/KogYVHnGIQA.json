  "description": "Riddle School is a classic flash game about escaping a school, since your teachers are dumb. Today, we're speedrunning through every game in the series. To speedrun them, we use some very clever solutions, and go way to fast\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/93EW9RxXMDQ\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #RiddleSchool #Speedrun",
