Andrew is indeed the werewolf, we got to look at Tobey Maguire's d**k and I'm so glad that everyone who's been saying this for years can rest now. We can rest now. Beyond that though No Way Home has a number of big surprises in it and it's the most fun I've had in a theatre since Endgame. I am just gonna be calling them by their acting names as referring to them as Peter 1, 2 and 3 will get confusing but each one of them brings something special to the film.\n\nThe movie picks up immediately after the events of Far From Home with Peter's identity out there and he has to live with the reprecussions of his new found fame. They even got some of the actors back from that scene including this guy who shows up in both films. Nice.\n\nThough his name is cleared by none other than Matt Murdock his life and the life of his friends has been ruined by the court of public opinion and their applications to MIT are rejected. The group can't get into any schools at all and it's clear that even though they didn't do anything wrong they've been cancelled.\n\nTheir lives are all ruined though and thus Peter goes to Doctor Strange in order erase this knowledge from everyone's mind so that his friends lives can have somewhat normality.",
