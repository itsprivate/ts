  "description": "The Vision, which was often carefully cleaned with flannel, had once been taken away from Arataki Itto.\nBut Itto has never been discouraged. On the contrary, after overcoming various hardships to regain his elemental power, his fighting spirit has burned even brighter.\nYes, that's right. I guess his mettle is exactly what makes him the boss of the Arataki Gang.\n\nDownload FREE: https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en\n\n#GenshinImpact #miHoYo\n\n↓ Follow us for the latest news ↓\nOfficial Website: https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en\nOfficial Community: https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GenshinImpact/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/genshinimpact/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/",
