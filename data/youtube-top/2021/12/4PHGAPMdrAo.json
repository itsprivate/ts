  "description": "In this video I built a real life Fortnite Battle Bus and surprised some of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it including @Tiko  and @FaZe H1ghSky1 ! They loved how it turned out so I hope you enjoy as much as they did!\n\nCheck out my first merch drop!\n►  https://www.beemteam.shop\n\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at $1,000\n►  https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\nNEW VIDEOS EVERY TUESDAY!\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @Mbeem10\n➽ Twitter - @Mbeem10\n➽ SnapChat - @Mbeem10\n➽ TikTok - @Mbeem10\n\nI have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube for the Beem Team. I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Fortnite Chapter 3!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 3, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Spiderman, But Fortnite Highlights, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Tfue, Ninja, Tiko, FaZe H1ghSky1, Typical Gamer, SypherPK, McCreamy, Lachlan, Unspeakable, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a Real Life Fortnite Battle Bus to celebrate the release of Fortnite Chapter 3!",
