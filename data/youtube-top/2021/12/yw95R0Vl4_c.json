  "description": "Watch The Duchess of Cambridge and Tom Walker perform 'For Those Who Can't Be Here' at Westminster Abbey for Royal Carols: Together At Christmas.\n\nThe performance took place in The Chapter House inside Westminster Abbey in December 2021. The song was played as part of the Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, a carol service that reflected upon the difficult past 18 months for people across our nation, and particularly for those who might be more vulnerable, isolated or have limited access to support.\n\n#TogetherAtChristmas was a moment to recognise those who have struggled during the pandemic, as well as to celebrate the individuals and organisations who carried out inspirational acts of kindness and incredible feats to help those in need in our communities. \n\nWith thanks to Tom Walker: https://www.youtube.com/c/iamtomwalker\n\nWatch more:\nMental Health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEarly Years: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nEngagements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBeZm...\n\nFollow us on our other channels:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dukeandduchessofcambridge\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal",
