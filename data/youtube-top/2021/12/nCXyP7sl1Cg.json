  "description": "The future of Gymkhana has arrived! Introducing my brand new Audi S1 e-tron quattro Hoonitron! Brian and I take a quick trip to Audi’s Design Center in Ingolstadt, Germany to see my 1 of 1 Gymkhana Prototype. It's wild that Audi was able to condense a one year build process from the drawing boards to reality in only four weeks! The all-electric Hoonitron is essentially a fully modernized version of one of my favorite race cars, the legendary Group B Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2, so I'm extremely excited for this. All that's left now is to patiently wait for my opportunity to Hoon it.\n\nSubscribe to my channel for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/KenBlockHHIC\nFollow me on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kblock43\nFollow on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/kenblockracing\n\nRad gear that The Hoonigans make for me: https://www.hoonigan.com/collections/ken-block\n\n#BlockGoesEtron\n#BLOCKxAUDI\n#AudiPartner",
