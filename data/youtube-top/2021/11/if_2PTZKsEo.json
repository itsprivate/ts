Use primitive tools, hydro-powered machines, and player-built structures to dig and evolve your operation in this tycoon-style progression system.\n\nUsing a state-of-the-art voxel based terrain system, you can create cave networks, quarry pits, or even mud mountains. Discover relics of the past in the depths of Hydroneer, with better rewards the deeper you dig.\n\nHydroneer features a dynamic modular system for building structures and hydro powered machinery. Create the base of operations from your own design to optimise your work. Create networks of hydro pipes, control pressure. Craft resources, weaponry, and jewellery.\n\nRigs are large hydro powered machines used for a variety of uses, from digging resources to transporting goods.\n\nVarious parcels of land await you in the world of Hydroneer, each with their own advantages. Deeper pits, attractive scenery, and closer stores. You decide where to build your base of operations.",
