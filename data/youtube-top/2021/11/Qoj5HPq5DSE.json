But today, Lizzy Capri, Ryan Prunty, Bailey Payne, @Hunter Kowald, @Drage Kamerman, @Austin Mills, Matt Braeden, Deniesse, Andrew and of course Carer Sharer played Squid Game IN REAL LIFE!! We did the Red Light Green Light challenge, followed by the Korean Sugar Cookie (also known as dalgona candy) challenge. This is a cookie recipe that uses caramelized sugar with baking soda. We add shapes you have to cut out when hardened (but cracking eliminates you)! Then we did the tug of war challenge into the pool, and finally the sky bridge where only one person would win while the losers had to fall into the deep end of the Team RAR mansion pool!! We had a lot of fun on this one. Nobody does it like Team RAR!! What games would you like to see us play next??
