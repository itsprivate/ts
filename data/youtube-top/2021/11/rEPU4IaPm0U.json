  "description": "Thanks to Epic Games for sponsoring this video! Naruto and Team 7 have arrived in Fortnite!! Play as Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura or Kakashi and discover the Konoha Village in Fortnite Creative! Jump on and play now: https://cherrypicktalent.cc/FortniteNarutoDangie\n\nWe built and survived inside the world's tiniest underground bunker and a giant underground bunker! Who will be last to leave in this survival challenge. The giant bunker is so large we will give you the full tour, but Jeff can barely fit inside the tiny underground bunker. Although that one will be impossible to find if we were playing hide and seek. These are the best bunkers Dangie Bros have ever built! Special thanks to the Dangie Bros build team! Which bunker would you rather live in?\n\nFOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:\n\nFollow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en\n\nFollow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en",
