  "description": "I built MrBeast's SQUID GAME statue named Yeong-hee and surprised him with it! I am stoked with how it turned out and Jimmy was SHOCKED when he saw it! \n\nCheck out my first merch drop!\n►  https://www.beemteam.shop](https://www.beemteam.shop/\n\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at $1,000\n►  https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\nNEW VIDEOS EVERY TUESDAY!\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @Mbeem10\n➽ Twitter - @Mbeem10\n➽ SnapChat - @Mbeem10\n➽ TikTok - @Mbeem10\n\nSquid Game is the largest TV show of all time with 140 million viewers and when I heard that MrBeast was going to recreate the Squid Games in real life I knew I had to be a part of it! I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, and a Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom), but I've never built something like this. This statue is more of a moving art piece than anything else so I had to bring in my friend from Canada to help build it. After multiple weeks of building we finally finished and delivered it across the country to North Carolina to surprise Jimmy. He was AMAZED at how good it turned out and I can't wait to see it in his \"Playing Squid Game in Real Life\" video! This was a real challenge to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \n\nComment ‘’Squid Games statue is creepy!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Playing SQUID GAME in Real Life, But $100,000, But In The Circle, But Extreme Hide and Seek, But 1,000 times, But Buried Alive, But Last to Leave, But 24 Hours, But 50 Hours, But Squid Game, or any other video like MrBeast, Stokes Twins, Ben Azelart, Lexi Rivera, Brent Rivera, Pierson, Faze Rug, Carter Sharer, Preston, Unspeakable, Brianna, or Ryan Prunty would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem designs, builds, and surprises MrBeast with an epic Squid Games statue for the inaugural MrBeast Squid Games event!\n\nThis is a video where Matthew Beem and the Beem Team built the world's first real life Squid Game statue and surprised @MrBeast  (aka Jimmy Donaldson) with it!",
