  "description": "Our first Seek Discomfort Holiday Drop \"Create the Spark\" is live now with a free bracelet gifted for every purchase above $45 ⚡️Check-out SEEK DISCOMFORT now!! http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\nIn other great news, Seek Discomfort is now carbon positive.. Meaning we offset more carbon than we produce. Just one of the many steps we hope to continue taking to lessen our impact. We know there are many additional ways we can continue being better and we are doing our best to make them happen as quickly as we can.\n\nWe understand that monetarily this is not a decision every can take. But if anyone else is in fact interested we highly recommend working with Brookes & Partners, the same company we used. They were efficient and knew the process front and back.
