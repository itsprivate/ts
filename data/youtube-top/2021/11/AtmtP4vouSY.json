The instantaneous launch window is at 7:19 a.m. EST, or 12:19 UTC.\n\nThe booster supporting this mission previously launched Crew Demo-2, ANASIS-11, CRS-21, Transporter-1, and four Starlink missions. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the Just Read the Instructions droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. One half of Falcon 9’s fairing previously supported the GPS III-4 mission and a Starlink mission, and the other previously supported another Starlink mission.",
