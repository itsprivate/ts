  "description": "This review of the Intel Core i9-12900K CPU (Alder Lake) includes benchmarks versus AMD’s R9 5950X, 5900X, and more. Intel is gunning for position as the best CPU.\nSponsor: Thermaltake TOUGHRAM XG RGB on Amazon: https://geni.us/mClGL8X\n\nOur review of the 12900K CPU versus the 5800X, 5900X, 5950X, 10900K, and more evaluates the gaming performance, power consumption, and production performance. We’re looking to find the best CPU for gaming and for office tasks (like video editing, 3D modeling, and programming) as we run through our updated CPU benchmark suite for 2021.\n\nGrab a GN Tear-Down Toolkit on back-order now to guarantee you get one in the next run!
