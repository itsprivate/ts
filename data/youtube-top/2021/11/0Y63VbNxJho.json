  "description": "🔥SHOP NOW!!🔥━► https://www.teamrar.com/ \n\nCarter Sharer and Team RAR just did the Highest Rocket Launch Wins $10,000 contest (https://youtu.be/HAJ1cpt9AWk) But today at the new Team RAR house, Lizzy Capri, Deniesse, Matt, Andrew, @Hunter Kowald, and of course Carer Sharer are doing the ultimate Last to Leave Monster Truck competition to win $10,000!! That's right, forget the Monster Jam, if you want to win the real thing, all you have to do is stay on. Each person got 10 minutes to prepare. Liz and Deniesse turned the truck into a girl's lounge, Hunter got his drone, Andrew made a sled and Carder made an RC car chariot!! Did you know remote control cars could do that?? Hunter got hungry and ordered a Papa John's pizza which was somehow delivered using his drone?! In the end, this was a very rare two-person win for a Last to Leave competition. Do you agree with the results??
