  "description": "Bel-Air | Coming 2022 to Peacock: https://pck.tv/3DcdDDy\n\nSynopsis: Set in modern-day America, Bel-Air is a serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the 90’s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.\n\nAbout Peacock: The streaming service from NBCUniversal that’s as free as a bird.
