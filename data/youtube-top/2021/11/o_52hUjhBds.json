Dream said that he would drive the car and beat the game in it, Sapnap also said that he would drive the Minecraft car and beat the game in it, Georgenotfound also said that he would drive the car in Minecraft and beat the Minecraft game in the Minecraft car. But you won't guess what, I also said I'd beat the Minecraft game car in a car Minecraft beating the game the car the game Minecraft. This was actually hilarious, as we all know, Minecraft cars make Minecraft funnier.\n\n\n\nHelped Edit: https://twitter.com/Wheatskins_",
