  "description": "It’s gonna be Mei! 🐼 Watch the brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s Turning Red, coming March 2022. \n\nDisney and Pixar’s “Turning Red” introduces Mei Lee (voice of Rosalie Chiang), a confident, dorky 13-year-old torn between staying her mother’s dutiful daughter and the chaos of adolescence. Her protective, if not slightly overbearing mother, Ming (voice of Sandra Oh), is never far from her daughter—an unfortunate reality for the teenager. And as if changes to her interests, relationships and body weren’t enough, whenever she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS), she “poofs” into a giant red panda! Directed by Academy Award® winner Domee Shi (Pixar short “Bao”) and produced by Lindsey Collins “Turning Red releases on March 11, 2022.\n \nwww.instagram.com/pixarturningred\nwww.twitter.com/pixarturningred\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PixarTurningRed \nHashtag: #TurningRed",
