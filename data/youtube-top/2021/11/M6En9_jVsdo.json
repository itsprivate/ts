  "description": "Poppy Playtime is one of the scariest games that has come out this year, so how scary is it when you try to speedrun it?\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the No Major Glitches world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/ZGmYwp0-3yA\nWatch the any% world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/TAQu4wqyK6w\n\nA couple of notes:\nFirst, I was doing the no major glitches category, instead of the any% category. This is because my Twitch stream voted for that one, so here you go. And secondly, this game is really intensive on your computer while streaming so it lagged in a few places, but mostly was fine. Sorry about that though. \n\nPoppy Playtime description (on Steam):\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nYou must stay alive in this horror/puzzle adventure. Try to survive the vengeful toys waiting for you in the abandoned toy factory. Use your GrabPack to hack electrical circuits or nab anything from afar. Explore the mysterious facility... and don't get caught.\n\nWelcome to Playtime Co.!\nPlaytime Co. was once the king of the toy manufacturing industry... until everybody inside of the factory one day disappeared into thin air. Now, years later, you must explore the abandoned factory and uncover the truth.\n\nThe Toys\nThe toys of Playtime Co. are a lively bunch! From Bot to Huggy, Catbee to Poppy, Playtime does it all! As long as you're at Playtime Co., why not pay the toys a little visit? You might just make a few friends...\n\nThe GrabPack\nThis amazing GrabPack is a wearable backpack, accompanied by 2 artificial hands attached via steel wire. With this handy, state-of-the-art tool, there's no limit to what Playtime Co. employees can accomplish! The following list of features should help to show you what the GrabPack has to offer.\n\nThe hands' powerful grip allows for movement of heavy objects with ease!\n\nA lengthy and flexible wire gives any employee the ability to reach whatever they may need, no matter the distance!\n\nThe steel wire makes conducting electricity a breeze!\n\nThe only limit is the length of your GrabPack's wire.\n\nWon't you stick around? There's lots of fun in store for you. It's almost Playtime...\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #PoppyPlaytime #Speedrun",
