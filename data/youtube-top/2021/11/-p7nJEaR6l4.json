However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.\n\nI Transformed the End in Minecraft Hardcore\n\n#minecraft #but #hardcore\n郊석둷郊석둷郊석둷郊석둷郊석둷郊석둷郊\n\nAll music by Kevin Macleod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence.\nLink to Artist: https://incompetech.com/music/\n\nThumbnail Inspiration: @WadZee \n\ncurrent sub count: 320,592",
