Innit I completely Transform the End to try to make the Minecraft Planet Mega Build look better\n\n⚙️My Setup (affiliate link)⚙️\n🎤mic: https://amzn.to/3x90Yit\n\nFollow my socials!\n➽TikTok - tiktok.com/@sandiction\n➽Twitter - https://twitter.com/sandiction\n➽Twitch - https://twitch.tv/sandiction\n➽Discord - https://discord.gg/zvYkw4kycm\n➽Business Email - sandiction.channel@gmail.com\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nThis series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.\n\nI Transformed the End in Minecraft Hardcore\n\n#minecraft #but #hardcore\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nAll music by Kevin Macleod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence.\nLink to Artist: https://incompetech.com/music/\n\nThumbnail Inspiration: @WadZee \n\ncurrent sub count: 320,592",
