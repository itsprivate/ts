  "description": "Let’s unf**k the planet, one video at a time.\n\nHere’s the challenge: \n1) Grab your phone. \n2) Make a YouTube Short sharing a “before” and “after”—i.e. one simple thing to heal the Earth. \nExample: trash to composting. Textile waste to upcycling. Any problem to any simple solution! \n3) Search for the challenge song “Can't You See Remix #UnFckItChallenge” in the YouTube Shorts music library.\n4) Use #UnFckItChallenge in the title of your Short so it’s sure to be counted.\n\nLittle things add up. Let’s do this.\n\nTo see everything that YouTube and Google are doing to create a more sustainable Earth, please visit https://sustainability.google/.",
