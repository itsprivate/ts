  "description": "You all have been sending me some WILD Tiktoks promoting some flat out dangerous and incorrect medical advice, so I put them all together for another TikTok React. Today we look at buttergirl eating butter dipped in ragu, how to stop your period in its tracks, synthol guy building muscles with oil injections, sunscreen contouring, only jayus body hacks, extreme stretching, sparkling water vs. tap water, colonic cleanses, russian chiropractor treatments, cigars vs. cigarettes, tobacco use, garlic in your nose to clean congestion, the acidity of gatorade, clearing your baby's sinuses, keloid scars, microneedling, ear candling, earwax removal, and as always CHEST COMPRESSIONS!\n\nI LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!\n-Doctor Mike Varshavski\n\nHelp us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
