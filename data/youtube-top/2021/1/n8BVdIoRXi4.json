  "description": "KSI plays Minecraft with me and it was the funniest thing ever\nFULL STREAM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf-5pIty6Vo\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/Quackity\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/QuackityHQ\nSTEAM: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quackity\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/quackityhq\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/quackity/\n\nKSI today decided to play Minecraft with me, quackity, on the DreamSMP which is a Minecraft server owned by Dream in Minecraft, so KSI being KSI and Minecraft being Minecraft I decided it was a great idea for me, quackity, to bring KSI onto DreamSMP which is the Minecraft server owned by Dream. This is gonna be amazing because KSI knows nothing about Minecraft let alone the DreamSMP server. So many big creators have came on the DreamSMP like Ninja and Pokimane but this time around it's KSI's time to shine on Dream's Minecraft server DreamSMP.\n\nHelped Edit: https://youtube.com/wheatskin",
