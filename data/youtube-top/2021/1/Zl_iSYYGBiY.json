  "description": "Learn how to repair a deep scratch in the paint of your car. In this case someone keyed my car so I will show you how to remove a deep scratch from that using a touch up paint pen. Fixing scratches in your car's paint is simple and if they are just clear coat scratches it is even easier. \n\nTo remove deep scratches you need to clean the scratch, sand the scratch, use touchup paint on the scratch, sand that paint smooth with the factory paint job, add clear coat, and wet sand that smooth with the factory paint. Then you can polish the whole panel and you are done!\n\nClear Coat Scratch Repair: https://youtu.be/2nYF46P7B2c\n\nPaint Pen: https://advanceautoparts.rt8x.net/voOO3\n1000-1500-2000 Grit:  https://advanceautoparts.rt8x.net/mD0b7\n3000 Grit Sandpaper: https://advanceautoparts.rt8x.net/x0Rbx\n5000 Grit Sandpaper: https://advanceautoparts.rt8x.net/QRWea\nPolish: https://advanceautoparts.rt8x.net/rABbj\nPolishing Pad: https://amzn.to/2YcLJEG\nMicrofiber Towel: http://amzn.to/1TQK01h\nTape: http://amzn.to/1SEBgtL\nIsopropyl Alcohol: https://amzn.to/36dak0H\n\n\n→ As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n→ Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7\n→ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit\n→ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8\n→ Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com\n→ My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix\n\n**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a \"thumbs up\" and consider subscribing.**\n\nDisclaimer:\nDue to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.
