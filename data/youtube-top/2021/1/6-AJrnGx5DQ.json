  "description": "My mom told me to go play outside.. so I built my dream Fortnite Tree house gaming setup. This setup is so good for Twitch streamers because it is a breeze of fresh air. We made this setup at the gaming FaZe House in Los Angeles and it costs over $10,000. It has a new keyboard, mouse, monitor, desktop, leds, food, candy, drinks and more! If you are a gamer you will love this big boy. Epic games unban me #FreeJarvis\n\nKevin: @FrenchieFries \n\nüï∫ TikTok: @jarvis\nüì∏ Instagram: @fazejarvis\nüê¶ Twitter: @liljarviss",
