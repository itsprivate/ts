  "description": "James Harden was held to only 16 points last night as the Rockets fell to 3-and-6 in a blowout loss to the Lakers. Houston has lost 4 of their last 5 and Harden seems to be ramping up the pressure on the team to get him out of there. After the game Harden said the Rockets are 'just not good enough.' He then went on to say quote 'this situation is crazy. It's something that I don't think can be fixed.' Hear what Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe have to say about Harden's statement.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #JamesHarden #Lakers #HoustonRockets \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
