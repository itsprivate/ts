  "description": "With each breath we have the opportunity to begin again, to arrive in the present moment. In this foundational phase of this journey I invite you to see each new practice as a new arrival.\n\nAccept and celebrate that each day will be different. Some days you will have more energy than others. Some days it will seem as though the universe is supporting you to show up, eagerly, and fully. Some days your brain will* make it very hard for you to arrive, and it may seem like the exterior is winning over your interior goals. \n\nMake your #1 goal to show up on the mat. \n\nSelf care is learning the practice of meeting your self each day, learning about who you really are, and continuing to arrive to devote to the process of self discovery, not perfectionism. \n\nWith each breath, a new arrival. \n\nIt‚Äôs a powerful tool, and one we are going to cultivate and celebrate together. \n\nLet me know how Day 2 goes for you in the comment section down below!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n‚ù§Ô∏èSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ‚ù§Ô∏è\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\nüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBecome a FWFG YOGA member! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nhttps://fwfg.com\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
