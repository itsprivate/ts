  "description": "technically i got 4 minecraft world records today. i'm so great at speedrunning!\n\nWatch live at: http://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Discord: https://discord.gg/Fz6Dtdq\n\nCheck out the game creator here: https://youtube.com/c/Stevenstuff\nDownload the game here: https://stevensstuff.itch.io/floppy-minecraft\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nAnd yeah, today we tried speedrunning bad minecraft. This is a cursed minecraft mod and I think you can see why. I mean we have guns. I think that just shows how cursed it is. Also there are realistic physics like falling tree... and guns... I don't know why I'm so caught up about that. Whatever, enjoy the speedruns and you definitely will because each one of them is a world record... on a game that no one else speedruns... okay I should just stop talking.\n\nAlso I'm gonna do this cause all the cool kids do:\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speedrun / speedrunner of Minecraft against a very much cursed game.\n\n#EazySpeezy #Minecraft #Speedrun",
