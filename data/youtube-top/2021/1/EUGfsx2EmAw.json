It was properly mental.\n\nSTREAMING ON THE DREAM SMP SOMETIMES - https://www.twitch.tv/tommyinnit \n\nEdited by Tommy + Huge Man Editor Yahi ( @Yahiamice )\n\n@Wilbur Soot @Ph1LzA @JackManifoldTV @Tubbo \n\nFollow my Twitter - @tommyinnit\n\nFollow my Instagram - @tommyinnitt\n\nToday Me, Wilbur Soot, Tubbo, Jack Manifold & Philza Minecraft install the Natural Disaster Mod in Minecraft 1.16.4! Even though I had a Minecraft War with Dream on the Dream Team SMP Minecraft Server today Tubbo went crazy and he is just hilarious and we had lots of laughs. This was so fun, awesome, poggers and cool! This Minecraft Mod uses Natural Disasters which make the game so fun and cool but not Colorblind like GeorgeNotFound - thank god! I Love Minecraft fun. \nThis video was inspired by Slimecicle who did another video first on this and it was very funny & poggers!\n\nThe Funniest Minecraft Video Ever with New Funny Mods makes Minecraft 1.16.4 even funnier & hilarious! It is lots of fun and laughs :) \n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me and my good friends playing the NEW FUNNIEST MINECRAFT MOD EVER!!! POG CHAMP!!!",
