  "description": "Following a dull 0-0 match in the Premier League just a week ago, Manchester United and Liverpool find their scoring touch in a 3-2 FA Cup thriller at Old Trafford. Mohamed Salah ends his goalless run with the opener for Liverpool, but Mason Greenwood strikes right back for the visitors. Marcus Rashford gives the hosts the lead in the second half, only for Salah to score again to level the game 10 minutes later. Substitute Bruno Fernandes ends up playing the hero for Man United with his superb free kick past Alisson with 78th minute as the Red Devils advance to the FA Cup fifth round.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
