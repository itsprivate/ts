  "description": "The miata is finally +turbo so it’s time to go back to the racetrack and see if Zach can run a decent lap at Willow Springs. Since last time we were at this track, the cooling system has been upgraded, the brakes have been upgraded, we’ve added an oil cooler, moved to a standalone ECU, and of course, added a turbo kit; to make an overall total of $17,500. Will all this money in mods be worth it or will we have big issues again?\n\nBig thanks to @EADExotics for hosting another great track day! \n\nWe have a new channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvwuc_zaBzXpEo6Up35jxg\n\nMoney Pit is where you get to learn about cars as we work on them.
