  "description": "Your first yoga practice is here, and it is a full one, packed with valuable invitations! We begin by taking things nice and slow. You will soon feel more fire, you may move fast, but this series asks you to be disciplined about bringing awareness to the deeper layers of your practice - with breath. \n\nWhat makes this 30 Day series unique is that these practices are designed to work together 1-30, not just as one-offs, though that is time well spent too. \n\nThis series is a process with intention. Today‚Äôs practice is all about listening, respectfully setting the tone, building foundation with slow and with purposeful movement. \n\nThank you for joining me on this journey and for sharing this connection with so many people around the world. \n\n**REMINDER** If you are not signed up for the daily email that corresponds with each practice video, sign up for free and receive your free BREATH calendar here: https://www.yogawithadriene.com/breath\n\nLet me know how it goes for you in the comment section down below! \n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n‚ù§Ô∏èSUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ‚ù§Ô∏è\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\nüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBecome a FWFG YOGA member! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nhttps://fwfg.com\nJoin Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
