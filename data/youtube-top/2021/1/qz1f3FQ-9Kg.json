Whether it's the two towers opening with the perspective of Gandalf, Lost showing us the plane crash from the view of the others or Back to the bloody future 2 showcasing Marty trying not to bone his mum again it always feels like it adds a lot of context.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if this is your first time here I'm your host Paul and I just wanna give a huge thank you for getting our breakdowns trending on Youtube two weeks in a row. I love you 3000 now let's get into the spoilers.\n\nOk so Monica Rambeau is someone that I feel we need to talk about in general before we get into what happens in the episode itself. Her debut in the MCU actually happened all the way back in the 1990s when we saw her as a kid in Captain Marvel starring Brie Larson.\n\nUnder the name Photon Monica is able to modulate her own energy to change her appearance so that she can look like anyone she wants to. Monica can also fly, fire energy blasts and absorb the energy of things around her. She also possesses superhuman speed, can turn invisible and phase through solid matter.\n\nThere was actually a hint give to us in last weeks episode that she now has been these gifts when being thrown through the membrane as when she landed there was a strange light around her that disipated. Not to jump too far ahead but we know that she will be featuring alongside Ms Marvel and Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel 2 so expect to see a lot more from her in The Marvel Universe.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaiz++anblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\nMusic By Lakey Inspired\n» Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lakeyinspired\n» Spotify: https://goo.gl/aLkwM5\n» SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired/\n» SnapChat: Lakeyinspired",
