  "description": "It's very fitting that Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith saw himself as the runaway choice to win the 2020 Heisman Trophy in a straw poll conducted by CBS Sports. After all, Smith ran away from defenses for most of the season.\n\nSmith was the frontrunner to win the Heisman on Tuesday night after catching 105 passes for 1,641 yards and 20 touchdowns so far this season. He leads the country in all three categories. Smith would be the first wideout to win the award since Michigan's Desmond Howard in 1991. Notre Dame's Tim Brown (1987) and Nebraska's Johnny Rodgers (1972) are the only other receivers in the modern era to win the award.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ\n\n#Heisman #DevontaSmith #HeismanTrophy #2021Heisman #Alabama #CrimsonTide",
