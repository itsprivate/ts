(Speedrunner VS Hunter Challenge)\r\n\nFollow My Socials:\n∘ Twitter - @wispexe\n∘ Instagram - @wispexe\n∘ Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/wisp\n∘ Discord - https://discord.gg/wisp\n\nThis is a Minecraft (1.16) challenge in which I am trying to speedrun Minecraft and beat the enderdragon, however, I am being hunted down by 30 HUNTERS! The twist is that I can use the MORPH MOD and shapeshift into any mob in Minecraft... This was super intense!\n\n#MinecraftManhunt",
