  "description": "Minecraft Achievement Hunt... Can we complete some of Minecraft's most random achievements? Or will we die trying...\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nDream:  @Dream \n\nThis is a new 1.16 challenge we decided to try. We try to complete random achievements that are given to us each round. We have three minutes to complete our random achievement or we lose. Me and my friend Dream are both given random achievements and whoever loses first, loses the game. This was really fun and I really enjoy doing these types of challenges with my friends!",
