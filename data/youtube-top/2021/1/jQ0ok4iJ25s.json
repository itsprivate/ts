  "description": "(Jan. 6) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress will resume the Electoral College proceedings once the Capitol is cleared of pro-Donald Trump protesters and safe for use.\n\nPelosi said she made the decision Wednesday in consultation with the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the vice president, who will preside.\n\nShe noted the day would always be “part of history,” but now it would be “as such a shameful picture of our country was put out into the world.”\n\nTrump had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington to fight Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s win. He held a rally earlier Wednesday and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, telling them to “get rid of the weak Congress people” and saying, “get the weak ones get out; this is the time for strength.”\n\nTrump supporters breached the Capitol building and clashed with law enforcement before disrupting Congress’ tallying of the Electoral College votes. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the November election was stolen from him, even though that is not true.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.
