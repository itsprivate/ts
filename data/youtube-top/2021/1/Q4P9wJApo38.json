  "description": "I finally pulled the trigger on an electric car...\n\n\nThis is the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. It was a tough choice between this and a Tesla (both are awesome cars). The Tesla has a lot more in terms of autonomous tech/software where the Taycan leans into Porsche's racing heritage/feel. The Taycan Turbo S is likely a touch faster around a race track compared to Tesla's current performance model as well (if that matters to you).\n\nPorsche North Toronto\nInsta - https://www.instagram.com/PorscheNorthToronto/\nYoutube - https://youtube.com/c/PorscheCentreNorthToronto\n\nFOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES\r\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\r\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/lewis.hilsenteger\r\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/unboxtherapy",
