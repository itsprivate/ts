  "description": "One constant refrain during the build to UFC 257 and the rematch between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor was that Poirier was not the same man he was when McGregor knocked him out in their 2014 featherweight meeting. Poirier proved that to be true in the rematch on Fight Island when he survived early blitzes from McGregor to score a shocking upset victory by second-round knockout.\n\nMcGregor came out fast, flashing his trademark speed and power, and even dipping back into the same shoulder strikes that led to the knockout of Donald Cerrone in his January 2020 return to the Octagon. Through it all, Poirier remained steady, working over McGregor with leg kicks, eventually taking the base of the Irish superstar before blitzing him with punches, dropping him to the canvas and scoring the knockout at the 2:32 mark of Round 2.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ\n \nFOLLOW US ON:\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports\n\n#UFC #McGregor #Poirier #ConorMcGregor #DustinPoirier #UFC257 #MMA",
