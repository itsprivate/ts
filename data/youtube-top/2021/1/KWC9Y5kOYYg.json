  "description": "Skeppy plays Minecraft Manhunt with Technoblade\n\nFollow My Twitter - @Skeppy\n\nFollow My Instagram - @Skeppy\n\nToday Technoblade and Skeppy play Minecraft Manhunt! Kind of! Basically I get a 30 second head start and then I attempt to survive 20 minutes against the Blood God himself. I honestly give up on this game. I hope Dream and the Dream Team are proud of me for this one. This was such an incredible display of skill so you all should definitely be impressed and hit this video with a like! :D 150,000 likes and I will do another Minecraft Manhunt.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me and my good friend Technoblade playing minecraft manhunt LMAO",
