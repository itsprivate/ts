  "description": "Apex Legends: Legacy brings a new form of competition, Arenas. Drop into a new action-packed 3v3 game mode. Sharpen your skills in new, bespoke maps like Party Crasher and Phase Runner. It’s just your squad and their squad, so hiding isn’t an option.\n\nWe’d wish you luck, but in Arenas, there isn’t any. This is a true test of skill.\n\nValkyrie, daughter of notorious Titan Pilot Viper, is also joining the Games. Take advantage of her jetpack to own the sky and rain missiles down on your foes. Master the new high-precision Bocek Bow to skewer your opponents and drop into an Olympus that’s been mysteriously transformed. Plus grab the latest Battle Pass and prove yourself in Ranked.\n\nThere’s nowhere to hide this season, Legends. Ready to find out if you’re predator or prey? Discover your true nature when Apex Legends: Legacy launches May 4!\n\nApex Legends™ is a free-to-play battle royale game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier.
