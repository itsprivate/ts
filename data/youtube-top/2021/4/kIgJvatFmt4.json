Reese's Puffs!\nI knew going into it it'd be one of the more difficult cereal challenges due to how crunchy Reese's Puffs are, but what I didn't expect was the Chocolate & Peanut Butter flavor to be off the charts...\n\nENJOY!!!\n\nNOTE: We had the whole are around where I was eating blocked off from the dogs until it was safe, so there was no chance of them gettin to a puff. Mentioned it in the video, but got cut bc it took too much time.. We're responsible dog ppl! :)\n\nFollow me on Social!\nFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/mattmegatoadstonie\nTWITTER - https://www.twitter.com/mattstonie\nINSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/matt_stonie\nTWITCH - https://www.twitch.tv/mattstonie\nMERCH - http://www.mattstoniemerch.com\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.
