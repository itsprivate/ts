  "description": "Watch as Asa PROPOSES to Bailey after they dated for over four years! He planned this all on his own, with some covert help from Brooklyn, family and friends. Bailey had no idea. What was your favorite part of the proposal? SUBSCRIBE and COMMENT BELOW!\n\n✅ Here is the ring Asa chose for Bailey from James Allen: 👉🏻 https://bit.ly/3gacwM5\n\n✅ Be sure to follow us on Instagram to see MORE PROPOSAL PHOTOS and Stories! 👉🏻 https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\n\nI met Asa met five years ago WAY BACK in 2016 when I was only 16 and he was 15. I didn’t know it then, but I had just met my future husband! It took a year of him pursuing me, and me constantly putting him in the FRIEND ZONE, before I realized what a catch he really was! On Feb 25, 2017, Asa and I officially started dating, ending the day with my very first kiss! You can watch that video, HERE: https://youtu.be/FsI8KtveD3A (y’all prob know that story😉)\n\nIn the beginning of this proposal video, there is a small outtake taken when Brooklyn and I were filming our music video for Simple Things in May, 2017. In that moment, Brooklyn and my mom had put Asa up to the task of pranking me with a fake wedding ring and proposal! Little did I know then that four years later Asa would be the one to OFFICIALLY propose to me... and I wouldn't have it ANY. OTHER. WAY! \n\nAs Asa walked me out to where he planned to propose, I started bawling my eyes out when I figured out what was going on... I literally had NO clue! The date 4/3/21 will forever be a day to remember for the both of us.❤️ It might seem small to you, but it was like even the world was counting down for us! \n\nI’m so glad I got to say YES to my forever! (I’m still having a hard time remembering to call Asa my fiancé instead of boyfriend LOL!)\n\n💋's -Bailey\n\nPS~ Special thanks to Lizzy McAlpine for lending us the use of her unreleased music, to our friend Antoine for taking photos and video, and Kamri for editing this proposal video!
