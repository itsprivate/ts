  "description": "Minecraft, But Dream Hunts Me Down... This was super intense!\nI have to beat Minecraft, but Dream is trying to stop me. If I kill the Ender Dragon, I win. If Dream kills me, he wins. This challenge was really hard but a lot of fun!\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitch/Twitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nDream: @Dream\n\nDream and I played Minecraft Manhunt against each other. Dream is the hunter and I am the speed runner. Dream is a lot better than me at Minecraft so I got extra health to make it more fair!",
