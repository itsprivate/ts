  "description": "What is it about Madrid and this competition? Missing a couple of key players, no problem. They outclassed Liverpool from start to finish and truth be told they could take more than their 3-1 advantage to Anfield next week, such was the gulf in class between the sides. Brilliant, brilliant work from Zidane and his boys. \n\nStream every UEFA Champions League match live on Paramount+:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/\n\n#UCL #RealMadrid #Liverpool #LiverpoolFC #Soccer #UEFA #championsleague",
