Eshleman for Reel Bear Media\n\nLYRICS\nI don't bother anyone\nNervous when I stand\nChoking on the circumstance\nOnly smoking secondhand\nCut us open, spread us out\nDry us in the sand\nLay the fibers side-by-side\nAnd you'll begin to understand\n\nI know it's over\nI was born a choker\nNobody's coming for me.\n...coming for me\n\nI don't bother anyone\nNever make demands\nChoking on the circumstance\nSelf-sabotage is a sweet romance\nSeems like all I'm worth is what\nI'm able to withstand\nSooner I can realize\nThat pain is just a middle man.\n\nI know it's over\nI was born a choker\nNobody's coming for me.\n\nI see no volunteers\nto co-sign on my fears\nI'll sign on the line\nAlone.\n\nI'm gonna change my circumstance\nI know I need to move right now\n'cause...\n\nI know it's over\nI was born a choker\nNobody's coming for me.\n(only smoking secondhand)\n\nLike a little splinter\nburied in your skin\nSomeone else can carve it out\nBut when you've got the pin\nIt hurts a little less\nand you can even push it further in\nWhen your body's screaming out\nTrust your mind's listening.\nLike a silhouette that you can barely see\nAs the shadow casts upon the ground\nwhere you'll eventually\nlay forever, but the day goes on\nthe sun moves behind you\nYou get taller, bolder, stronger, \nand the rear-view only blinds you\n\nSubscribe for more official content from Twenty One Pilots: https://top.lnk.to/subscribe \n\nSite: http://smarturl.it/TOPsite\nStore: https://store.twentyonepilots.com \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/TOPspotify\nFacebook: http://smarturl.it/TOPfacebook\nInstagram: http://smarturl.it/TOPinstagram\nTwitter: http://smarturl.it/TOPtwitter\nTumblr: http://smarturl.it/TOPtumblr\n\n#TwentyOnePilots #Choker #ScaledAndIcy",
