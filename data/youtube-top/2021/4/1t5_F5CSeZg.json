I thought it couldn't get worse from the previous one. I was wrong.\nPrevious episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byVMRj9UaQI\n\nTwitch (I STREAM A LOT): https://www.twitch.tv/fundy\nTwitter (FUNNY STUFF): https://twitter.com/fundylive\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/fundy\n\n★  Did you know subscribing on YouTube is free? Pretty neat, you should check that out.  ★\n\nSo I made your dumb twitter ideas in Minecraft. This was absolutely hilarious and funny and horrible all at the same time. It featured Minecraft YouTubers from the Dream SMP such as Tommy, Tubbo, Quackity, but not Dream, George, Wilbur, Ranboo, or any of those guys. Maybe if you guys enjoy in the next one I can feature them :] Enjoy the video!\n\n#Fundy #Minecraft",
