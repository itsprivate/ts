In this heartfelt presentation, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, and Ken Potrock, president of the Disneyland Resort share messages of optimism and gratitude to the cast members of the Disneyland Resort. \n\nAfter more than a year of closure, we are pleased to provide a live glimpse of a shining symbol, reawakened: Sleeping Beauty Castle in the heart of Disneyland. It is our wish that it may represent a beacon of hope for Disney fans everywhere. \n\nSee more on the Disney Parks Blog: https://bit.ly/3sRwn5w\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://di.sn/q7h​\n\nAbout Disneyland:\nDisneyland is where imagination is the destination.
