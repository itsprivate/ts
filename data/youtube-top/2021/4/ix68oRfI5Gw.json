  "description": "Check out https://Kiwico.com/StuffMadeHere for 50% off your first month of any crate!\nThe robot arm I used: https://hubs.ly/H0K42Hg0\nPlease consider supporting these projects through my patreon: http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere \n\nWhen I was offered the opportunity to beta test an upcoming robotic arm from Tormach, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with it. CNC chainsaws baybeeeeee. Aside from being fundamentally awesome, it is a very interesting software problem. Since I didn't have to build the arm I was able to focus the project and the video on the software challenges of making something like this work. Thank goodness I didn't have to build the arm because the software almost killed me. I can imagine all kinds of next steps for this creation like machining textures with the chainsaw or cutting topiaries. I hope you like it!\n\nSources:\n *  Low Polygon Labrador Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:446787\n *  RRT  GIF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree#/media/File:Rapidly-exploring_Random_Tree_(RRT)_500x373.gif\n\nOther great things (your purchase helps support this channel):\n*  I use a glowforge pro for rapid prototyping and it's great.
