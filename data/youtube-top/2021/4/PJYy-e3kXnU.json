  "description": "Meet Valkyrie, the ultimate wingman and a Legend who's poised to dominate the sky. http://x.ea.com/68308\n\nDaughter of notorious Titan Pilot Viper, Valkyrie lost her father at a young age. She inherited her father’s love of flight, but not his sense of duty. Except in one regard. She swore to kill the man who’d sent her father to die: his Faction Leader, Kuben Blisk. But when the moment came to pull the trigger, she hesitated -- he spoke of Viper with respect. And he challenged her to be better. Valkyrie shot him anyway, but she didn’t take his life. Just his invitation card to the Apex Games.\n\nValkyrie’s jetpack – forged from the remnant’s of Viper’s Northstar Titan – allows her to fly above the battlefield for a limited time. When it’s time to swoop in for the kill, she can unleash a swarm of missiles to damage and disorient her enemy. And if things get too hot she can employ her Ultimate – which allows her and her entire squad the ability to quickly reposition and find the next fight. Valkyrie enters the games with something to prove and ready to rain death down from on high.\n\nThere’s nowhere to hide this season, Legends. Ready to find out if you’re predator or prey?
