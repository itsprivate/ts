  "description": "Manchester City picked up a decisive 2-1 win in the first leg of the UEFA semi final against Paris Saint-Germain. \n\nPSG came out firing in the first half and converted one of their many chances into a goal. Marquinhos scored in the 15â€™ to give PSG the lead. PSG kept the pressure on in the first half and finished with 9 shots on goal. \n\nIn the second half PSG was content to sit back and defend the one goal lead. Manchester City took advantage and notched two goals both from set pieces. \nDe Bruyne scored in the 64' when he tried to play the ball to the far post off of a free kick and instead found the back of the bet. Then Mahrez put the English side ahead in the 71' when he found the hole in the PSG wall off of a free kick right outside the box. \n\nManchester City was able to maintain that one goal lead and will head back home with a huge advantage on aggregate. \n\nStream every UEFA Champions League match live on Paramount+:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/\n\n#UCL #UEFA #ChampionsLeague #PSG #ManCity #ManchesterCity #ParisSaintGermain",
