  "description": "Today Architectural Digest brings you to Australia to visit Troye Sivan at his beautiful Melbourne home. Unpretentious yet expertly decorated, Troye collaborated with designer David Flack of local firm Flack Studio to bring the vision of his sunny, soulful home to life. An erstwhile brick factory and handball court, the property was transformed into a residence in 1970 by architect John Mockridge, preserving the essence of its Victorian-era origins. Today, it’s an eclectically decorated sanctuary - and a home for Troye’s artistic imagination.\r\n--\r\nAkari UF3-Q Lantern: https://fave.co/2Qs6ATQ\r\nSurface Mount Disc Orb: https://fave.co/3sgUydn\r\nChanneled Copper Velvet Pillow: https://fave.co/2QwzQZS\r\nSOLVINDEN LED Solar-Powered Pendant Lamp: https://fave.co/2Q4O448\r\nFlax Linen Sheet Set: https://fave.co/3uSFRyS\r\nEarth Fired Clay Herb Pot + Saucer: https://fave.co/3ae7c6q\r\nCopper Saucepan: https://fave.co/3snWtwF\r\n1909 Checkered Black and White 5 x 7 Area Rug Carpet: https://fave.co/3ae85Mv\r\nWhite Marble Mortar & Pestle: https://fave.co/2QmrPXb\r\nVintage Linen Bed Cover: https://fave.co/3gh2g4G\r\nStacking Patio Dining Armchair: https://fave.co/2RyQaJT\r\nCristobal Throw: https://fave.co/3djJyr7\r\nCallimaco Floor Lamp: https://fave.co/3afFPsR\r\nLucinda Terracotta Stacking Chair: https://fave.co/2OS8JrF\r\nCavallo Clay Bisque Tile: https://fave.co/3gi9JAv\r\nHoney Rattan Vase: https://fave.co/32hr6t3\r\nHigh Atlas Taznakht 3 Rug: https://fave.co/3geQMii\r\nShimmer Table: https://fave.co/3avPVpR\r\nSong Sofa: https://fave.co/3dlIinr\r\nTom Natural Three-Legged Coffee Table: https://fave.co/2RE4ktm\r\nUnited Strangers Misses Armchair: https://fave.co/3dq48GJ\r\nCantera Planter: https://fave.co/3sfK9P2\r\n\r\n--\r\nIntercolonial Handball Match.\r\nAuthor / Creator\r\nCalvert, Samuel, 1828-1913, engraver.\r\nSource: State Library Victoria.\r\n\r\nHandball: the intercolonial match.\r\nReproduction rights owned by the State Library of Victoria.\r\n\r\nFore more information on Hotels of Pyongyang, check out their Instagram Page:  Instagram handle is also @hotelsofnorthkorea : https://www.instagram.com/hotelsofnorthkorea/?hl=en \r\n\r\nSelect artwork by @hotelsofnorthkorea.\r\n\r\nArtworks by Jahnne Pasco-White, Nell, Tom Polo and Jahnne Pasco-White, courtesy the artists and STATION Australia.
