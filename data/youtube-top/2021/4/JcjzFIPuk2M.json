  "description": "Shall we play a game? The new War Games Event features five rotating takeover modes with never-before-seen modifiers, a new rewards track, and new skins.  \n\nMaggie warned the Legends what would happen if they didn’t deliver Fuse to her. Now she’s following through on her threat. Say goodbye to your precious games -- Salvo’s War Games are here instead. Play five rotating limited-time takeovers over two weeks. Shields regenerate in Shield Regen, round time is reduced whenever a Legend dies in Killing Time, automatically retrieve fallen banners in Auto Banners, compete for top loot in Ultra Zones, and get a free respawn in Second Chance. Plus check out the store to get bold new cosmetics. Everybody loves a little Mayhem -- get out there and make Maggie proud. \n\nApex Legends™ is a free-to-play battle royale game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier.
