First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?
