Yo:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/moneybaggyo/\nhttps://twitter.com/moneybaggyo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moneybaggyo\n\nLyrics:\nI been tryna figure out like why a mafucca want you to be loyal to them\nWhen they ain’y loyal to you, ion – ion really get that\nThey be tryna show love in private because \nThey done told people people they don’t fuck with you in public and shit \nThat shit be crazy, ion be understanding that shit \nNiggas be feeling away about bitches and \nCome on man if ain’t about no money what we doing \nSpeak \n\nI done over played my part they forgot about me amnesia (it’s cool tho)\nI done hit yours, you done hit mine why you still mad we even (I ain’t on that)\nThe blogs put up anything and the crazy part they believe em \nNigga caught a charge and got locked up, only reason dude still breathing \nI’ll never make a hoe feel like I can’t do no better than her\nHeard that she got a new nigga my bag the biggest she said he on fuck how I fuck\nBitch lied on God and her kids, threw me off damn that fucked up my trust\nI know a nigga a cross you to win, where you at wit it, yeah I come from the bluff \nLil bro don’t go through there spinning can’t do it myself (why) cuz my position\nI’m peeping niggas in slick competition, really some bitches sit down when they pissin\nThey get some fame off me if I mention, but it’s a shame on me if I did it \nI know you obsessed with me and I get it stay in yo lane and stay out my business\n\nOver there\n\nYall running off with all these rumors and shit \nQuick and shit making assumptions \nNext thing you know you judging a nigga damn\nWhat about the truth, it’s two sides to this shit\nI been that nigga, I been lit, I been the shit \nBefore I ever went public with a bitch \nYall just catching on late \nSpeaking on my personal life\nMy real life talking bout how it’s fake nigga \nYou aint me, you ain’t in my shoes, you ain’t pay dues\nSpeak\n\nHe ain’t no gangsta, never did nothing gangsta \nThat’s what they said, that’s what they thought\nI done seen so many niggas end up dead cuz they got misled (facts)\nAin’t got no time for no baby mouth ass nigga tryna get spoon fed\nAll that he say she say, code red numb to it brain dead\nWithout yall I won’t be shit, hope the haters hear me loud and clear (I’m making sure)\nUnc told me “a scary man a dead man, you can’t live ya life in fear,” so I’m taking risks You can’t get a fair bond last time I checked how them charges disappear (hold up)\nLack of communication with my bitch, got her acting all insecure \nI come from the struggle like you did, nigga why the fuck you tryna down me (huh)\nIf I gotta coach a nigga on how to be real, ion need around me (at all)\nYou can’t fix ya mouth to say I ain’t fuck with ya at least one time \nWell two times, nah three times couldn’t see the envy I was too blind\n\nSee they probably thought I would running out \nHold time I was holding back shit a infinity clip \n I’m what’s going on so I’m already knowing my name gone be in ya mouth, but\nWhen you have them conversations make sure you mention \nHe getting six figures for a show, 11 whips paid for, house sitting on four acres \nTake care of his kids, treat all of em equally\nMomma put up, she can wiggle her toes at night, peacefully \nShit like that what I do it for \nSpeak\n\nHope for the best prepare for the worse \nHowever it come just know that I’m ready \nYou know a lie don’t give a fuck who tell it \nI know they mad but they never admit it\nIt be ya own people \nThey gone try to take advantage of you if you let em\nThey get a thrill off turning you down but never gossip but how you help em\nI heard it’s niggas out hear wanna touch me but I can’t tell I be where they at\nWatch you draw the line so stay over there\nDon’t come round the gang, don’t throw up the set\nYou not what I rep, why do some shit you gone regret (answer that)\nThink smart with it, this shit chess\nJust cuz yall related don’t mean nothing \nNiggas on some ice about they check\nAll that you love me shit ain’t genuine \nI felt the vibe when I walked in \nShit slick, hurt me thinking you solid then I saw you bend \nEven after they true colors show kept it real on my end \nThat wasn’t my beef at first I made it mine cuz me and bruh locked-in (for life and after)\n\nWhen I say we la familia we la familia, we locked in for life\nShit loyalty over love, we gone keep it real first \nLike you not gone see me fucking with my nigga opp\nIon give a fuck if I knew his opp longer than him \nNiggas a hate you so much they can know yo opp a rat and still hang with em\nDon’t that make them the same nigga shit let me know I need clarification \nWhat part of the game is that \nSee I know what need to be done\nNigga need to start pulling straight up \nChecking these niggas, these niggas can’t stand no pressure\nYou ain’t gotta feel how I’m coming where I’m coming from \nIf pain was a person \nBagg\n\n#MoneybaggYo​​​
