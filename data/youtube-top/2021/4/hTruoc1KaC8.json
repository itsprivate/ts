  "description": "DMX has died. The rapper turned 50 in December. His death follows a heart attack he suffered, which was triggered by a drug overdose. Amid DMX’s hospitalization, a rep for his family told ET that he was in a medical state from which they do not think he will recover. On Monday, a vigil was held by the Ruff Ryders to the Rescue Foundation outside of DMX’s hospital. The ‘Party Up’ performer was nominated for three GRAMMY awards, and he won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the American Music Awards in 2000.\n\nExclusives from #ETonline :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv",
