  "description": "47 Minecraft Block Facts You Possibly Didn’t Know! As on Minecraft 1.16, Minecraft has hundreds of blocks to choose from, with plenty more coming in the new 1.17 Caves and Cliffs update. With all of those blocks, it's easy to lose track of different pieces of information. In that case, Skip the Tutorial and Block Facts are covering the best bits of minecraft block information and facts. Frankly, most of this is useless minecraft information, but still fun to find out new things, and maybe you'll learn something.\n\nCheck out @Block Facts !\n\n▪Want more?
