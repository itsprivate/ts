  "description": "Today, I played bedwars with TommyInnit. He insisted on using 1.16, so it led to some weird glitches. He's also British which I find kinda funny\n\nTommy: https://youtube.com/c/TommyInnit\n\nEdited: https://twitter.com/luvconnies\n\nLivestream highlights channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/PurpledLIVE\nVODS channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/PurpledVODs\nTexture pack: https://bit.ly/purpleddefaultpackv1\nTwitter: @burpled and @purpled_alt\n\nCurrent subscriber count: 874,000\n\nMinecraft Hypixel Bedwars with TommyInnit and Purpled from the Dream SMP.
