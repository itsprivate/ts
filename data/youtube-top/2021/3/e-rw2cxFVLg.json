  "description": "Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, or simply Without Remorse, is an upcoming American action thriller film directed by Stefano Sollima and written by Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples. It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by Tom Clancy and a spin-off of the Jack Ryan film series.\n\nThe film tells the origin story of John Kelly (aka John Clark), a U.S. Navy SEAL, who uncovers an international conspiracy while seeking justice for the murder of his pregnant wife by Russian soldiers. When Kelly joins forces with fellow SEAL Karen Greer and shadowy CIA agent Robert Ritter, the mission unwittingly exposes a covert plot that threatens to engulf the U.S. and Russia in an all-out war.\n\nFB: www.facebook.com/WithoutRemorseMovie\nTW: www.twitter.com/WithoutRemorse\nIG: www.instagram.com/WithoutRemorseMovie\n\nAbout Prime Video:\r\nWant to watch it now?
