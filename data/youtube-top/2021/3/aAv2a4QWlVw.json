  "description": "The British royal family is bracing itself for a highly anticipated interview between Prince Harry, his wife Meghan Markle and Oprah Winfrey. \n\nIn a clip that was released earlier, Meghan accuses the royals of perpetuating falsehoods about the couple. Just as that happened, the Palace said it was investigating bullying claims levelled against the duchess by former staffers. \n\nThe couple stepped down as working royals to pursue a new life in the United States last year.\n\nAl Jazeera's Neave Barker reports from London, UK.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe \n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish \n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera \n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\n\n#UK",
