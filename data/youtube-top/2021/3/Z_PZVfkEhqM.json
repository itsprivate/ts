Shoutout Phenom Hoops for putting on a dope event, I'm dropping a link to their YouTube down below, make sure to sub. \n\nAnyways, Jamarii Thomas can talk, but he can hoop too. He's a D1 commit and won't back down from ANYONE. Watch this episode and see what happened!\n\nSub to Phenom Hoops: http://ovrt.me/Phenom\nSub to The Hoop State Network: http://ovrt.me/HoopState\n\n---------------------------------\nFollow Us...
