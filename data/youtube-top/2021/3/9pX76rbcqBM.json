  "description": "Originally I wanted to do every boyfriend turn the skin would change but I underestimated how low in turns this song would have but even so I still have like a lot of clips leftover which I had no intention of going to waste. It's kinda of ironic when I literally stated that in my previous video but it was my fault for checking so I could only settle with this instead. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. I have to admit compared to most I think week 2 is underrated which is the reason why I wanted to make a video of it before I forget it since I did skip it like two songs ago. Overall, this song was much easier to do since most mods came with a Girlfriend and Boyfriend skin.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nOMORI MOD (Update: Bug Spray)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/14222\n\nKokichi + Nagito as Spooky kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188532\n\nSpookiez, But they're humanoid\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184827\n\nZim, Gir, and MiniMoose over Skid and Pump\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187577\n\nFamily Night Funkin Modpack\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184321\n\nMCYT MODPACK\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/14119\n\nSkid And Pump Skin Playable\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/183972\n\nLila over Daddy Dearest\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188959\n\nGumball and Darwin over Spooky Kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190432\n\nElegant Night Dancin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/16246\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd over Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191014\n\nThe Pelones \"Pelito\" replaces BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184485\n\nGarfield With beta bfcar and also color correction\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186782\n\nMarina Over GF (Splatoon)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187733\n\nKaede Akamatsu GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188879\n\n2B / Friday Night Funkin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184460\n\nShuichi Saihara BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187184\n\nPrincess Peach as Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184627\n\nRitz over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190929\n\nHoloNight Funkin' RETURNS!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/16817\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex​​​​\n\n#FridayNightFunkin​​​’",
