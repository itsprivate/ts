  "description": "Crepes are a not just a thin edible pancake. They're not a cake at all. They're a crepe. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlY\nBook + Merch: http://yousuckatcooking.com\nhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcooking\nhttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookin\n\nRECIPE\n\n1 large egg\n⅓ up flour \n¾ cup milk \n\nThis will make around 4 decent sized crepes \nMake raw egg pudding with the egg and flour \nAdd a bit of the milk and Wangjangler until smooth \nRepeat until you have no milk left \nLet the batter sit for an hour if you're a baby who loves following the rules\nPut a small amount of butter in a pan on medium heat, then wipe it out with a paper towel, or an expensive silk scarf \nPour some batter in and swirl it. For a medium large pan around ¼ to ⅓ cup of batter will be enough. For a 37 foot pan you'll need ten gallons of batter \nCook until crispy crusticles start to form \nLift\nBlow\nGrab \nFlip\nBut you can probably skip blowing and also don't use your fingers if you're worried about burning yourself. Just use a spatula or try to flip it in the pan...but honestly good luck lol you're not that good at flipping. \nCook the other side just a bit and then you know, stuff it or roll stuff in it, or fold stuff in it, or make crepe origami. Your call",
