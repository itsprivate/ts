  "description": "In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman’s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad, and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxYouTube\n\nBe the first to know more:\nHBO Max: https://hbom.ax/YT\nLike HBO Max on Facebook: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxFacebook\nFollow HBO Max on Twitter: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxTwitter\nFollow HBO Max on Instagram: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxInstagram\n\nAbout HBO Max: \nHBO Max is WarnerMedia’s direct-to-consumer offering with 10,000 hours of curated premium content.
