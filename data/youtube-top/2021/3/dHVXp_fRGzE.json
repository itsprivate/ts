And Iâ€™m sorry. I hope youâ€™re all ready, because youâ€™re about to see my story about the time I spent a ridiculous amount of money on a new PC, only to end up spending even more and nearly losing my channel. I thought Iâ€™d try something animated this time and a lot different - instead of me being on screen, I figured a funny cartoon animation in a similar style to theodd1sout would best illustrate how funny and unlucky this whole saga turned out to be. This is a lot more than a minute-long Caddicarus animated - this is a huge retelling of my story animated, in a special one-off animated story time. Actually, now that I think about it, is it theodd1sout or oddonesout? No clue. Maybe this is closer to Jaiden and their animations. Jaidenanimations? Jaidenanimation? Iâ€™m completely new to this story time animated kind of video, Iâ€™m a bit of touch. How about JelloApocolypse? I dunno, Iâ€™m totally lost. Either way - with special thanks to boymylife - I hope you enjoy my true story all about my how to build a PC teaching went entirely wrong. Gaming PC build s are a nightmare, and hereâ€™s why. And yes, I not only managed to get an NVIDIA RTX 3080 PC for my office, but an RTX 3090 for the streaming and recording PC too. Iâ€™m lucky. But not that lucky. Prebuilt PCâ€™s, build your own PC, everything is covered here.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more storytime animation videos and comedy game reviews on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#Storytime #Animated #Cartoon #Caddicarus #PCBuild #Gaming",
