  "description": "Similar to my last video, I wanted to do every boyfriend turn the skin would change however this song in particular is much more long lasting and tends to always call for a duet which allowed me to squeeze in the best mods I could find. Personally, the Senpai song was hard when it came to finding the mods for it especially Girlfriend. Still I have to admit that I love the unique pixel art and death animation a lot of artist put into these mods, really shows how passionate they are when it comes to their work. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. I find the whole weeb aspect of week 6 to pretty funny and epic since technically I am one myself. Overall, this was fun to make but hard to find decent mods to showcase.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nOMORI Mod (SKIN - Week 6)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188202\n\nMario in FNF (Like Senpai)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190197\n\nSans The Skeleton\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187254\n\nWilbur Soot (\"Incelbur\"/\"Simpbur\") Senpai\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187975\n\nEnter Ender | The External Entity\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190109\n\nMonika (DDLC) - New Song + Default Senpai Reskin\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/14832\n\nBrawlstars Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187272\n\nBaldi over Week 6\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/187170\n\nGravity Falls Over Week 6\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/17649\n\nDaft punk mod week 6\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/17709\n\n(WEEK 6 ONLY) Pixel Sonic\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/186959\n\nPixel Boyfriend over Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188143\n\n\"Electro Funkin\" Skins Mod: All Weeks\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/16895\n\nSenpai With A Gun Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190594\n\nPico in Week 6 Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190703\n\nPixel Tankman over Pixel BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191140\n\nMiss pauling tf2 over GF Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185912\n\nDDLC Glitched Pixel Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191722\n\nDDLC over background characters and GF (Week 6)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191542\n\nWeek 6 with speakers only\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187037\n\nDoom Night Funkin'\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/17534\n\nGirl Boyfriend (Friday Night Funkin')\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187090\n\nBoy Girlfriend (Friday Night Funkin')\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187658\n\nFNF Waifu Mod: Over Senpai\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187389\n\nFunkin' with Dalia (Week 6)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184662\n\nPLAYABLE VS Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/17925\n\nFrisk in FNF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184492\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex​​​​​\n\n#FridayNightFunkin​​​​’",
