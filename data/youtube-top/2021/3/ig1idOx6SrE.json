Um \nI really hope they held you down \nI really hope it was no lying \n'Cause my heart breaks, it feels like the world's gone \nBut if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion \nAnd you'd finally let bygones be bygones \nDon't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying \nYou just gotta learn to live and love on \nI belong with the one put on this Earth for me \nEverybody has their someone, just gotta look and see \nI'm screaming out, \"Lord, help me, I've been lonely\" \nThat's when you accept me, then you set me free \n\nUh, sometimes life's a mess \nI get high when I'm upset \nI remember when me and love didn't click \nSearching for somethin' real then I found it \nUh, sometimes life's a mess \nYeah, I get high when I'm upset \nI remember when me and love ain't click \nLooking for somethin' real then I found it \n\n(Clever) \nHave you ever fallen head over heels for somebody that made promises to give you the world? \nThere’s one that won’t never leave you cold \nor place nothing above you.. \nthat will love a heart that hurts- \ndon’t hurt the heart that loves you. \nSometimes they just want what they can’t have- forbidden fruit. \nBut the one that deserves ya love will never pick and choose. \nThere was once a hole in my heart- \nthat hole was hurting-  \ntil I took a peak inside- \nlately i’ve been soul searching. \nWhen I use to cry I turned to medication- \nthen I found me something real and forgot all the imitations. \nJust tell me that you’ll never leave. \nAnd when there’s nothing left to say. \nTell me that you’ll love me anyway ahhh \n\nUh, sometimes life's a mess \nI get high when I'm upset \nI remember when me and love didn't click \nSearching for somethin' real then I found it \nUh, sometimes life's a mess \nYeah, I get high when I'm upset \nI remember when me and love ain't click \nLooking for somethin' real then I found it \n\n(Post Malone) \nHave you ever fallen head over heels for somebody  \nthat made promises to give you the world?  \nAnd I swear I would never leave you cold \nThere ain’t no one above you.  \nYou were way too high to touch  \nI was high enough to pass out.  \nWhen you was so alone I was a stones throw away.  \nI remember those lips  \nI remember how they taste.  \nI been staring at the wall doing nothing all day.  \nI remember everything put the bottle to my face- Dom Pe.  \nIf you gave up on me now I would seriously be so fucked up.  \nI’m doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up.  \nNever gave a fuck what they say bout us.  \nFuck all of you muh fuckers slow me up.  \nand fuck everything that ruined us.  \nI’m three seconds away from pulling out my gun \n\n#JuiceWRLD #Clever #PostMalone",
