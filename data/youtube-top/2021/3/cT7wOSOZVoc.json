  "description": "Minecraft Survivor VS 3 Hitmen... This was incredible.\nClick the Merch link below for a chance to play in a Manhunt video with me! Merch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nBadBoyHalo:  @BadBoyHalo \nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Hitmen. This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!\n\nManhunt T-Shirt Details:\n\nEach and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.\n\nIn late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.\nEmployees and their families are not eligible for selection.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen\n\n#MinecraftHitmen",
