  "description": "After eating only one color food for 24 hours in this challenge it is time to spill some tea. Rebecca and Maddie are doing the never have I ever fondue challenge.  We find out if Maddie has a crush and do they have any crazy secrets.  Even though they are best friends and look like twins no one knows everything you do in 24 hours. Do you think someone will get scared and quit? Also, who will win and can they get along without fighting even if they aren't playing for $10,000?  \n\nWatch - Dogs Play Among Us to Reveal Their Crush is Missing - PawZam Dogs https://youtu.be/yTU4bANPLEo\n\nFollow us \nhttps://www.instagram.com/rebeccamaddiefitness\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@rebeccamaddiefitness\n\nRebecca Social Media\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rebeccazamolo\nTikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@rebeccazamolo \n\nMaddie Social Media\nhttps://www.instagram.com/maddiegray27\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@maddiegray27",
