  "description": "Juventus won the second leg 3-2, but Porto move on to the quarterfinal round thanks to away goals. Sergio Oliveira was the savior for Porto notching goals in the 19’ by way of penalty and in the 115’ to all but seal the win. \n\nChiesa notched goals in the 49’ and 63’ to get the offense going for Juventus. After Porto evened it up at 2, Rabiot found the back of the net just two minutes later to give Juventus some hope with three minutes remaining. Juventus almost rallied to score a stoppage time goal in extra time, however Porto’s defense stiffened and got rid of the threat. \n\nPorto who was undermanned after Mehdi Taremi was sent off in the 54’ still managed to knock off the traditional power and make some waves in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nStream every UEFA Champions League match live on Paramount+:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/\n\n#UEFA #UCL #ChampionsLEague #Juventus #Porto #ExtraTime",
