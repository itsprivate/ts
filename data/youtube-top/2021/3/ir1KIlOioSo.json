  "description": "Skeppy trolls BadBoyHalo with a Minecraft Morph Mod HAHAH\n\nTHANK YOU @BadBoyHalo \n\nToday BadBoyHalo and I are playing Minecraft with a really fun twist LMAO.  I basically told Bad to face me in a building competition in Survival Mode and I proceeded to troll the absolute life out of him. It looks like Bad's house has a creeper infestation - he even burns down a forest out of total frustration. It's okay Bad, it'll be fine.  Featuring awesome and hilarious morph's like the chicken morph,  cow morph, and much more. This video has such chaotic energy HAHAHA. Meow.\n\nFollow My Twitter - @Skeppy\nFollow My Instagram - @Skeppy\n  \nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is just chaotic morphing madness.",
