  "description": "Hey guys! Today I am trying a bit of a new concept for my channel. I decided to go shopping at the Dollar Store for a couple of items that I thought would be fun to paint on, customize and decorate to make them more of my style. I noticed shopping at the Dollar Tree, that there were so many cute things that had a lot of easy DIY potential. I wanted to do this to show that you don't need to spend a lot to have fun with art and customizing things. There are so many cheap and affordable items to be painted on! This video starts out with a mini dollar tree haul, and then I go on to feature 3 different $1 makeovers. I hope I give you some fun ideas for easy dollar store flips!\n\nLet me know if you want me to try this again or if you want me to try the \"EXTREME MODE\" (lol) dollar store makeover where I choose my art supplies from the dollar store as well.\n\n\nPRE-ORDER THE LIMITED EDITION RUBIK'S CUBE:\nhttps://www.moriah-rubiks.com/\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh ðŸ˜‚ ) and this is my channel....obviously.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up.
