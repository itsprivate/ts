  "description": "No. 1 UConn plays No. 2 Baylor in the Elite Eight of the 2021 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament.\n\nThe Huskies used a giant second-half rally to come back and take down the Lady Bears 69-67. A 19-0 UConn run was the difference, which came after Baylor senior guard Didi Richards left the game with a left leg injury in the third quarter.\n\nThe Bears nearly mounted a comeback of their own, falling just short in the final moments as the Huskies held on to advance to their 13th Final Four in a row.\n\nSubscribe to the NCAA Championship YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/NCAAChampionships?sub_confirmation=1",
