  "description": "Minecraft, But Every Mob Looks Like A Pig... This was super hilarious! We never knew what was coming at us!\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nDream- @Dream \nGeorge- @GeorgeNotFound\n\nThis is a Minecraft 1.16 mod that makes all mobs look like pigs. This made the game a lot more crazy because we never knew what mob we were dealing with. This was really funny and made even the most simple tasks like getting food dangerous. I really love doing these types of fun challenges with my friends!",
