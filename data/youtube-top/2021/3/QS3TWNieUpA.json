  "description": "So excited to officially partner with Chipotle and e.l.f. Cosmetics! It’s all that, and a bag of chips (and guac). Watch Trixie and Kim Chi try out the #elfxchipotle collection and their custom Eyes. Chips. Face. Bowls! Just like going through the line at Chipotle, the Chipotle Eyeshadow Palette is fresh and full of endless possibilities to customize. Turn up the spice with the Make It Hot lip gloss, or take it all to-go with the Eyes. Chips. Face. Makeup Bag. Shop it while it’s HOT these are gonna go fast! Plus order the Eyes. Chips. Face. Bowl (it’s vegan too!) in the “Featured” section of the Chipotle app or at chipotle.com. #Ad",
