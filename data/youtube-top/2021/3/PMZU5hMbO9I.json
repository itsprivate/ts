  "description": "As always this game is extremely fun and with todays video I decided to switch skins every turn rather than when it's just the boyfriend. I had a little more issue trying to sync the clips together near the end but I managed somehow. Also, I want people to still know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. In addition, I did not cross dissolve transition since one viewer recommended not too since it ruins the flow and while looking at it I have to agree. Even though some character skins didn't get a chance to sing I still made sure to each one gets a different skin while also making them look good in terms of their respected fandom. Overall, another fun video to make and I hope to continue for a little while longer.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nGenderSwap Pico\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/189906\n\nPico 2000s\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189086\n\nBIGGIE CHEESE\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185500\n\nNaruto over Pico!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188275\n\nKevin from Ed, Edd n eddy\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186471\n\nHollow knight little ghost over pico\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187525\n\nLyanide Over Pico\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189193\n\nDream Over Pico\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187992\n\nPhil from Riddle School\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/184033\n\nSix Over Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189995\n\nGirl Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187090\n\nNarancia (JJBA) as BF Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189684\n\nDarnell as Boyfriend Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185937\n\nScott Pilgrim joins the Funk' (Weeks 1 to 4)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190882\n\nPlayable Tankmen!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185177\n\nPico over GF 2\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190115\n\nJenny from MLAATR over GF!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188614\n\nPlayable Sans Undertale\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185286\n\nChara - From UNDERTALE/ DONTFORGET\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186417\n\nBoy Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187658\n\nHornet from Hollow Knight as GF!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188587\n\nLucifer from HT over gf\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185819\n\nTrish Una (JJBA) as GF Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188133\n\nDreamSMP Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188064\n\nDream girl friend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187290\n\nRapper GF + Nene!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185273\n\nIsabelle BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/187686\n\nYu Narukami Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185032\n\nP5 x FNF: Ann Takamaki as Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184829\n\nChiaki Nanami as Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185407\n\nNagito Komaeda over Pico!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184963\n\nFNF Mono Little Nightmares 2\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190163\n\nHajime Hinata over Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185626\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex​​\n\n#FridayNightFunkin​’",
