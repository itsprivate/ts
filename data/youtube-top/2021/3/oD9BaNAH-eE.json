So, late last year we decided to take the plunge and move across the country for a fresh start in a new place. After doing some serious decluttering, we packed up our house, grabbed our cat, and hit the road (and vlogged our whole cross-country road trip in our minivan!) It's been a couple of months and we are finally set up enough to dive back into making videos, so here is our moving vlog! Hopefully you guys enjoy it, and thank you for being so patient with us while we figure all of this out. \n\nAlso, sorry about any smudginess of the windshield! It was tough to keep clean on our drive, but I know sometimes it can look gross, so sorry about that! Lol\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nYou can check out my Instagram here! https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/â€‹\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork",
