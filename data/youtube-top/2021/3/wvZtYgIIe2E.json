  "description": "Get Yourself Some BRAND NEW Theory Wear! ► https://bit.ly/3beM0ys\n\nTheorists, we all know I love a good ARG. And Crow 64? Well, I had to dive in head first. Crow 64 is the ARG of the \"unfinished Nintendo 64 game\" called Catastrophe Crow. In the original video, we get the history of the game as well as our first playthrough footage. From there, it spread across the internet into a building mystery waiting to be figured out. Today, I am going to try to do just that. \n\nCheck out Adam's Channel ► https://www.youtube.com/user/AdamButcher\n\nThanks to u/TheNinjaCakes for letting us use their sprite pack! ► https://bit.ly/2LIjaZT\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Catch all the Theories! ► https://goo.gl/kQWHkJ        \n\nNeed Royalty Free Music for your Content?
