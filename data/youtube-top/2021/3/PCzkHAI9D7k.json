  "description": "Minecraft, But I Put A T-Shirt On Every Minute... This was the most ridiculous Minecraft challenge ever!\nEvery minute that goes by, I get bigger. All of the t-shirts made everything crazy...\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nThe goal of the challenge is to beat Minecraft, but every minute I have to put on an extra t-shirt. When the 1 minute timer ends, I have to stop whatever I'm doing to put on the t-shirt, even if I'm in a dangerous situation! This made the game way harder but it was still really fun!\nAfter recording the video, all of the t-shirts were washed and donated to good causes.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
