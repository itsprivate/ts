  "description": "Minecraft has a ton of features and some of them are pretty unknown. And what's more satisfying then fooling and impressing your friends with magic tricks using these features. From TNT that does no damage to diamond block printers, here are 22 Minecraft Magic Tricks. Thank you so much for 500k and I hope you enjoy!\n\n\n➤➤ Twitter: https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken\n➤➤ Discord: https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb\n\n\n➤➤ Music Used is Courtesy of Epidemic Sound\n\n\n➤➤Credit: \n-Skip The Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xZYc4SZUGfRERIvDRGqDQ\n-Water Magic Trick:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/j1lujk/you_can_use_this_trick_to_make_water_flow_in/\n\n\n\nThis is NOT a series called Minecraft VVSauce where I explore random features of Minecraft. Not Minecraft, but the water rises or Minecraft Manhunt but a list of some minecraft things you didn't know and things you should start doing. Combining these tricks / features to bring you 22 Minecraft Magic Tricks that are sure to impress and fool your friends. Some of these would make a great short on Dream shorts in my opinion but maybe thats just me.",
