We struck at the Hamas naval unit and we are continuing to strike at underground targets - Hamas' metro - and there are other targets. We will continue to operate as necessary in order to return calm and security to all residents of Israel.\"\n\nWith the two sides continuing to trade fire for over a week,... the overall death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 2-hundred,... with over 13-hundred others wounded,... according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael has reported 10 Israelis have died from rockets that have been fired from Gaza toward the country.\nThe violence continues despite calls from the international community to cease hostilities.\nThe leaders of Egypt and France shared strong concerns regarding the escalation of violence in the region,... underscoring the absolute need to end the atrocities.\n\n\"So, for me, it comes within the scope of a process of a cease-fire as soon as possible - what we, of course, call for - and the building of a possible path towards talks between the various parties involved.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Iran's top diplomat met with Pope Francis,... who appealed for calm and global help to open a path of dialogue in the Middle East.\nPope Francis stressed that the deaths of children in the latest surge of attacks was \"destroying the future.\"\nTurkish President also asked Pope Francis to support sanctions against Israel,... in a phone call,... urging the pontiff to continue to speak out against the violence.\nAll this comes as Washington is using \"quiet and intensive diplomacy\" to try and halt the escalating conflict between the two sides.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.\n\n#Israel #Gaza_Strip #Airstrike\n\nüì£ Arirang News(Facebook) : https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews\nüì£ Arirang News(Twitter) : https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews\nüì£ News Center(YouTube) : https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV\n\n\n2021-05-18, 07:00 (KST)",
