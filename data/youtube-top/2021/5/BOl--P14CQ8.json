  "description": "Can we beat Minecraft in a shopping cart? oh my gosh oh my gosh ah ahh ahh\n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/Quackity​\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Quackity\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/quackity\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/quackity/​\n\nToday we beat Minecraft but in a shopping cart with Dream and Georgenotfound, I put on my best divorced dad outfit as well. Dream said that he would push us in this Minecraft shopping cart with Georgenotfound in Minecraft in the shopping cart but the problem with Dream and his Minecraft videos is that this is no Minecraft Manhunt videos that Dream and Georgenotfound do on Dream's Minecraft Manhunt Channel this is the shopping cart Minecraft challenge, it's like a challenge of Minecraft Manhunt But instead its Minecraft Shopping cart Challenge with Dream and Georgenotfound, they are both awful at playing Minecraft in a shopping cart, in fact I could probably be the 6th hunter in the Minecraft Manhunt series and Dream would never win. In fact I could be the only hunter and win Minecraft Manhunt and Dream would cry.\n\nHelped Edit: https://twitter.com/Wheatskins_",
