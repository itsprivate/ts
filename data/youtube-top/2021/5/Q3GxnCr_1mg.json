  "description": "Chelsea are the Champions! Manchester City could not muster any offense against Chelsea and the Blues used a late first-half goal to win the UEFA Champions League crown.\n\nKai Havertz scored in the 42’ to give Chelsea the lead that they would never relinquish. \n\nWith the win, Christian Pulisic became the first-ever American player to win the Champions League. Pulisic came on in the second half as a “super-sub” and created opportunities for himself and his teammates. \n\nChelsea is the 2021 UEFA Champions League Champions.\n\nStream every UEFA Champions League match live on Paramount+:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/\n \n#UCL #ChampionsLeague #UEFA #ManchesterCity #Chelsea #Final #TheChampions #2021UEFAChampionsLeague",
