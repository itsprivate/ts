  "description": "Marvel just unleashed their first trailer for the Eternals and it has a TON of Easter Eggs connecting to the Marvel Cinematic universe and ancient human history. In this video we explain the Eternals connection to Thanos, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy, Infinity War, and (maybe) Loki. Plus we breakdown Kit Harrington’s role as Dane Whitman: the Black Knight.\n\nThe Eternals were created by the celestials to fight the Deviants, essentially mutated human monsters that enslaved humanity. Throughout history, these godlike immortals have guided and protected humanity. This trailer implies that they forgot their duty, and are scrambling to save the Earth before the clock runs out.\n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://bit.ly/subscribe-screencrush\n\nGo here → http://screencrush.com/\nLike us → https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush\nFollow us → https://twitter.com/screencrushnews\nGet our newsletter → http://screencrush.com/newsletter/\n\nWritten and Hosted by Ryan Arey (http://twitter.com/ryanarey)\nEdited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Antonio Polito. and Ryan Arey\n\n#Eternals #Trailer #EasterEggs",
