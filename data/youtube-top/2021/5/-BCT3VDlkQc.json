  "description": "Last night was a rough one for the Los Angeles Clippers (and Marcellus Wiley). They fall to 0-2 after losing once again to the Dallas Mavericks. Luka Dončić remained hot, finishing with 39 points, while Kawhi Leonard and Paul George combined for nearly 70, but it was not enough, However, George didn't seem to be bothered, saying quote 'there is no concern, there is competition. We got to rise to the occasion..we got to play our game.' Ric Bucher joins Emmanuel Acho and 'Coach' Wiley to discuss whether it's panic time for the Clippers.\n\n#SFY #NBA #KawhiLeonard #PaulGeorge #LukaDončić #Clippers #DallasMavericks  \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from Speak For Yourself: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n \n►Watch the latest content from Speak For Yourself: https://foxs.pt/LatestOnSFY\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD \n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n\nSee more from Speak For Yourself: http://foxs.pt/SFYFoxSports\nLike Speak For Yourself on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/SFYFacebook\nFollow Speak For Yourself on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SFYTwitter \nFollow Speak For Yourself on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/SFYInstagram\n\nAbout Speak For Yourself:\nSpeak for Yourself is an hour and a half sports debate show starring our FS1 talent covering the day’s hottest topics in sports and offering their unfiltered takes.\n\nClippers are in an emergency situation heading to Dallas down 2-0 — Wiley | NBA | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF\nhttps://youtu.be/-BCT3VDlkQc\n\nSpeak For Yourself\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SFY",
