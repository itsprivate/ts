  "description": "Beginning this week, we’re kicking off our first Wild Week for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6. https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-wild-weeks-kick-off-with-fighting-fire-with-fire\n\nWhat’s a Wild Week you ask? During these weeks, Fortnite will be putting an emphasis on a unique gameplay dynamic -- mixing things up and making you rethink your strategy.\n\nWild Week numero uno is all about Fighting Fire with Fire. That's right, the action is going to heat up as Firefly Jars and Flame Bows will be found in greater numbers all across the map. Set enemy buildings ablaze! And as part of this week, the Flare Gun is back for one week only.\n\nThis week’s Legendary Quest plays into the Fighting Fire with Fire theme. Be sure to check the in-game menu to see what’s cookin’.\n\nThe Fight Fire with Fire Wild Week, starts on May 6 and ends on May 13.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins. ESRB Rating: Teen with Violence.\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fortnite/​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FortniteGame​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FortniteGame/​\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Fortnite\n\nLearn More: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home",
