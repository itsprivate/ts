  "description": "This bonus weeks song is called Gospel and it comes from the Sarvente's Mid-Fight Masses Mod which had an update. This Friday Night Funkin' mod has an amazing song but when it came to the charting it felt more like a repeated spam similar to Ruv in Zavodila. I find the music gets pretty good near the middle and end which I choose the best skin mods for. My only complaint would be that some notes would often disappear for no reason. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. Overall, this was a great song to work with but I hated the fact that some notes would often disappear or even vanish for no reason.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nSarvente's Mid-Fight Masses\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/44345\n\nSARV SKNS:\n\nLady Dimitrescu\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187815\n\nYumiko Aigner Legrand mod-over mom\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187799\n\nPanty over Mom\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187769\n\nLila over Daddy Dearest\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185598\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Minus\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/download/186942\n\nKakyoin Noriaki over Mom\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187823\n\nFanMade Skeleton Mom Over Mom\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187791\n\nSplatoon over Week 4\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187784\n\nLoona Helluva Boss over Mom\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187824\n\nTHICC Sarvente Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/183663\n\nVerosika Mayday MOD\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/187694\n\nEx-GF Over Mom Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/186941\n\nSarv-Odila : Sarv's Turn!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/44030\n\n\nBOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND:\n\nSelever Playable\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/82xz13q9qukgnfe/selever%25F0%259F%2596%2595.zip/file\n\nCorruption Glitch Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/41987\n\nDemon Girlfriend Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185854\n\nPlayable MonsterBF mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185065\n\nLemon Demon over Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185826\n\nTall Boyfriend over Boyfriend!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185068\n\nGirlfriend is Taller!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185833\n\nPlayable Skeleton Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185048\n\nWeek 7 Skeleton GF over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185809\n\nMershark's Demon GF Skin\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185852\n\nDEVIL MAY FUNK 5\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/285735\n\nJotaro Kujo (JJBA) as Boyfriend Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185034\n\nTrish Una (JJBA) as GF Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185877\n\nFunky Fresh Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/184943\n\nDemon Girlfriend!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185796\n\nAnthro Doggo\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185069\n\nDoge/shiba inu gf mod!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/download/185881\n\nMarina Over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185863\n\nPlay as Young Daddy Dearest\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/184467\n\nPopstar Mom over Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/285559\n\nGentleman edition\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/184984\n\nAndroid 18 over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/185839\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex\n\n#FridayNightFunkin​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​’ #FNF",
