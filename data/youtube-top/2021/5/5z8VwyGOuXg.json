  "description": "Beating Minecraft Before I Freeze... This video was absolutely INSANE.\nI'm in a BUCKET OF ICE and can't get out until I beat Minecraft. Will I freeze or will I beat Minecraft? We're about to find out.\n\nFollow my socials ↓↓↓\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nI am in a bath in my house that is full of ice. I bought over 500 pounds of ice that is in coolers/freezers to keep it nice and frozen. Every one minute I have to scoop some ice into my ice bath. I get colder and colder as the challenge goes on. I can get out at any moment, but then I lose! This was a lot of fun to try and was a super crazy experience with my friends. I have never been this cold in my life. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!\n\nDream edited this video for me so say thanks to him :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
