  "description": "Turning plastic gloves into grape soda: https://youtu.be/zFZ5jQ0yuNA\n\nCheck out my main channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/NileRed\n\nThis is a giant container of methyl anthranilate, which is a really common grape flavor. It's a slightly yellow oil, and it's used to flavor a lot of things like candy or soda. It's most famously used to flavor grape Kool-Aid, but what I think is the coolest thing about it, is what it does under UV light. It fluoresces a really nice blue color, and it looks really cool when it's added to water.\n\n#shorts",
