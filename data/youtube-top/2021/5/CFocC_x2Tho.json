  "description": "We built floating tiny house boats using different budgets for this new epic budget challenge! There will be 4 tests that will determine who built the best house boat and to see which has the best survival capability. Will they float or will they sink? Which tiny house will have the best and most comfortable design? Which one will be the most satisfying looking?  We used pool supplies and also some home depot supplies for the builds and even went to target for our decorations and interior design. Such a fun summer challenge!\n\nDANGIE BROS GAMING CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGCMhCdAMHSCZ3U8AGy-SA\n\nDANGIE BRO MERCH:\nhttps://www.dangiebrosmerch.com\n\nFOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:\n\nFollow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en\n\nFollow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en",
