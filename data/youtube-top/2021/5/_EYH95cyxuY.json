  "description": "The Bad Batch episode 1 has officially begun! The 75 minute episode gave us tons of new material to learn about Order 66 in Star Wars and how it impacted the Clones in particular. This show is essentially a continuation of The Clone Wars, and I am pretty excited to see where it goes. The start of the show with Kanan and Depa had me on the edge of my seat, but once he went away, it was a bit slower for me. I'm looking forward to seeing where it'll go in episode 2, maybe we'll meet up with Rex and Ahsoka? \nWill we see Vader and Palpatine? I like how it shows where we are at certain moments during the episode, relative to Revenge of the Sith. I love those markers, it helps me know what else is going on in the galaxy and to keep things organized.\n\nWhat do you hope to see from next week's episode?\n\nBig merch drop at https://swtheory.creator-spring.com/listing/stay-humble-Theory use code NERD for a May 4th discount\n\nContinue the conversation on the Theory forums!\nhttps://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",
