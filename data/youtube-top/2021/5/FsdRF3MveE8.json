  "description": "Minecraft, But All Mobs Are Giant... This was insane! Every mob that came at me and my friends was super huge!\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @sapnap\n➽ Twitch - @sapnap\n➽ Instagram - @sapnapinsta\n\nDream- @Dream \nGeorgeNotFound- @GeorgeNotFound \n\nThis is a Minecraft 1.16 Mod that makes all the mobs that spawn naturally giant! This game made the game much more crazy and more difficult to beat! Mobs had giant explosions, projectiles and more! This made the easy tasks like defeating a creeper hard to do. I really enjoy doing these types of challenges with my friends!",
