  "description": "LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers were able to fend off Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the 7 versus 8 play-in game last night. All knotted up at 100 with a minute left LeBron threw up a deep 3-pointer to avoid a shot clock violation. After the game LeBron said quote, 'after Draymond Green's finger to the eye, I was literally seeing three rims out there, so I just shot at the middle one.' Hear what Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe have to say about LeBron's game-winning shot against the Warriors.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #LeBron #StephenCurry #DraymondGreen #GoldenStateWarriors #Lakers\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
