  "description": "I bit off more than I could chew.  Join me this summer in my Creative Engineering class!! https://Monthly.com/MarkRober\n\nNEW Phat Gus Merch here!! https://markrober.store/\n\nMore info about my Creative Engineering Course- \n\nThis class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.\n\nDuring this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up with the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.\n\nThe best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.\n\nThis is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.\n\nThe class officially starts on June 7th so claim your spot if you're interested!\n\nSee you in class!\n\n-Mark",
