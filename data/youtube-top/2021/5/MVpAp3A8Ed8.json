  "description": "Billie Eilish is a Gen Z icon, but her fandom spans generations – and includes more than a few famous faces. In episode 3 of British Vogue’s ‘Ask a Legend’ series, Halle Berry pops up to ask the star for songwriting tips for her daughter; Avril Lavigne wants to know about Billie’s future goals; and Sporty Spice is keen to hear her most life-changing moment to date. Her friend Denzel Curry meanwhile, just wants to know: “When am I going to see you again?” Watch the video in full to hear British Vogue’s June cover star on her first date, her favourite song from her own back catalogue, and whether she’d pick fresh sheets over fresh socks. \n\n\r\nSubscribe to British Vogue►► https://www.youtube.com/britishvogue?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH BRITISH VOGUE\r\nWeb: https://www.vogue.co.uk\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/britishvogue\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/britishvogue\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/britishvogue\r\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/britishvogue\r\nNewsletter: https://www.vogue.co.uk/newsletters\r\nSubscribe: https://www.vogue.co.uk/subscribe\r\n\r\nABOUT BRITISH VOGUE\r\nBritish Vogue is the world’s leading premium lifestyle and fashion entertainment channel.
