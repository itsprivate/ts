  "description": "SCHLATT PLUSHIES ARE HERE: https://youtooz.com/collections/jschlatt üêêüêê\n\nSchlatt talks about Discord's new logo.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/jschlatt\nhttps://twitter.com/schlatt\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/jschlatt\n\nEdited by me, all by myself\n\nIt's 2021 and Nothing Is Unique Anymore Except My Luscious Mutton Chops. In this Schlatt commentary video, Schlatt talks about stuff for a few minutes. Namely, Discord's new Logo. Yes, the Discord Redesign is bad and I don't like Discord's new logo. Discord is a bad company and I Will Never Buy Nitro Stop Asking Me. Even Jambo aka JCat aka Soup doesn't like corporate minimalism. He told me that the other night. Schlatt is upset by how brands ruin their perfectly good logos in favor of boring, lifeless, soulless Sans-Serif Wordmarks and flat design icons. \n\nGoDaddy, Petco, Discord, Smucker's, eBay, Pringles, and more companies with awful Logo Redesigns are talked about in this Funny Jschlatt Moment of a video. The Schlatt Ram Plushies are here and you should be buying them instead of reading this description. They are very well made and feel soft to the touch and I can't say that about most things.",
