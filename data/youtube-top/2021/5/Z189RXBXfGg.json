Coinciding with the debut of the State Farm NBA Play-In Tournament, Fortnite x NBA: The Crossover brings basketball’s best into the Item Shop and Fortnite Creative, and with Team Battles, a unique experience featuring all 30 NBA teams in Fortnite.\n\nDebuting on May 21 at 8pm ET, players can suit up and rep any of the league's 30 teams. The In The Paint Set includes 31 uniforms, including all 30 NBA teams. \n\nAlso available, grab the Shoot & Score Pack to get the Hookshot Emote and Mini Hoop Back Bling, which can feature the logo of all 30 NBA teams. When other players have the Mini Hoop Back Bling equipped, you’ll be able to call your shot! \n\nIf you’re more of a point guard, show off your handles with the Dribblin' traversal Emote.\n\n#FortniteNBA #TheCrossover #FortniteNBATheCrossover",
