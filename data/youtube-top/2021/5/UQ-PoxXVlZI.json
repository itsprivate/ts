Not only did my school find it, but other people did too.\n\nLivestream highlights channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/PurpledLIVE\nVODS channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/PurpledVODS\nTexture pack: https://bit.ly/purpleddefaultpackv1\nTwitter: @burpled and @purpled_alt\n\nCurrent subscriber count: 982,000\n\nPurpled Minecraft Solo Bedwars on Hypixel is HILARIOUS!!! Not really this time though I just had a little story time moment and moved on with things. I am on the Dream SMP and have lore now but that will come later. I literally edited this from about 11am to 7am (20 hours) because I forgot to get it done and decided to subtitle the whole thing and I am also incredibly inefficient at subtitling. This might be the last video I post before reaching 1,000,000 subscribers which is absolutely insane... thank you all for watching!\n\nHow EVERYONE Found My Channel\n\n#bedwars #minecraft",
