  "description": "Co-Ownership means you can share an Apple Card account with your spouse or partner and build credit equally. \n\nComing July 2021: You will be able to invite another Apple Card owner to combine credit limits and form one co-owned account in an upcoming iOS release. Each co-owner is individually liable for all balances on the co-owned Apple Card including amounts due on the existing co-owner’s account before the accounts are merged. Each co-owner will be reported to credit bureaus as an owner on the account. In addition, co-owners will have full visibility into all account activity and each co-owner is responsible for the other co-owner’s instructions or requests. Co-ownership involves risk, including payment history and other information about your Apple Card, including negative items like missed payments. Addition of a new co-owner is subject to credit approval and general eligibility requirements. For Apple Card eligibility requirements, see support article HT209218. Either co-owner can close the account at any time which may negatively impact your credit and you will still be responsible for paying all balances on the account. For details on account sharing options including some of the risks and benefits, see support article HT212020.",
