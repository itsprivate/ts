  "description": "Minecraft's Most Unbelievable and Rarest Seeds... Minecraft seeds can make some Minecraft worlds look ABSOLUTELY INSANE, so today we showcase and look at the most craziest Minecraft Seeds.\n\nHELP ME HIT 500K SUBSCRIBERS BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR! \n\nTwitch: SipoverS\n\nTwitter: SipoverS\n\nInstagram: SipoverS \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/qFrX5Qb\n\nNot Minecraft's History on Youtube or Glitches, or even the entire history of minecraft i guess, and not even close to Ranking Minecraft's rarest occurrences and Minecrafts most mind-blowing inventions. Dream could totally use some of these seeds for a manhunt speedrunner vs hunters... Or maybe even tommyinnit in a Minecraft Mod video. \n\nCredits to reddit and the Minecraft@home team for finding the majority of these seeds, they're crazy. \n\nDISCLAIMER: All of these seeds are Java besides the ravine, Some of the seeds in this video only work on certain versions, so if it isn't working try other versions like 1.12, 1.7.10, and 1.14. \n-To find the landmarks, do /locate(biome) (landmark) like stronghold or village and you should be able to find the landmark.",
