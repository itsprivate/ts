You pulled down the description, which means you've unlocked a secret: I'm testing out a weekly newsletter, to help get around The Algorithm. It goes out on Mondays, contains a link to that week's video, but it also has a load of other interesting things that I've found over the week. I'm not publicising it much right now because I'm still testing that everything works, but if you want to subscribe, you should go here: https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo",
