  "description": "Today we are going on a journey. Here is what has been happening in my life for the last month.\nMy best friend Daniel and I were in a horrible car accident that changed our lives and was very haunting. It's been exactly ONE month since everything happened and I wanted to talk about everything. I never expected sympathy but the amount of people who were celebrating our accident, was truly disturbing. Here is the TRUTH about everything. Thank you all so much for all the well wishes and love, it's been overwhelming and such appreciated.\n\nWANT MORE? üê∂ Meet My NEW Pomeranian Puppy!
