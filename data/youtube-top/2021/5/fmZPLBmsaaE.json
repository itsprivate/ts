Despite Israeli air strikes already killing nearly 200 people in Gaza - 58 of them children - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to continue its aerial bombing campaign \"with full force.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group controlling the Gaza strip, also remains defiant, as it fired more rockets in retaliation, which have so far killed 10 people in Israel.\n\n As Mike Armstrong reports, the United Nations Security Council has held an emergency meeting, as leaders outside of the conflict - including U.S. President Joe Biden - work to broker peace.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews",
