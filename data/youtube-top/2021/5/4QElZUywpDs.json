  "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers fell 121 - 114 to the Toronto Raptors at home last night to drop to - 2 since LeBron James returned on Friday. LeBron missed the final six minutes of the game due to ankle soreness. After the game, LeBron said nothing matters unless he is a hundred percent and also criticized the play-in game format for the playoffs saying whoever came up with it should be fired. The Lakers now face five straight playoff teams starting with the Denver Nuggets tonight. Hear what Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe have to say about the Lakers' slump.\n\n#Undisputed #NBA #LeBron #Lakers #TorontoRaptors #DenverNuggets\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED\nListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotify\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED\n\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\n▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE\n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE\n\nSee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSports\nLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebook\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitter\nFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagram\n\nFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitter\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitter\nFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitter\n\nAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:\nUNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.
