  "description": "Hello friends! Bad makeup science is back! Wait no, not makeup -- just bad *general* science, I guess. Here is a weird video we made where I mix one of every hand sanitizer from Bath & Body Works together!! Bath & Body Works is notorious for having a ton of different hand sanitizers, so I thought it would be fun to mix them together to see what the midpoint color & fragrance will be - and to try and spice up my ~hand sanitizing~ routine. \n\nJust a quick disclaimer - some of the shots in the intro/buying segment of this video are shots from our Franken-candle video from 2018, which is why everyone is ~unmasked~. Also, any extra sanitizers that we still have after this video will be donated! And, as always, do nothing i do ever -- please don't overly inhale sanitizers, lol.\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/â€‹\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork",
