However beyond that in the comics it's a purple planet that we end up visiting in this episode.\n\nWe open with the song Demons by Haley Kiyoko because...well we're dealing with horned gods. They also encounter a woman who calls them devils and devil imagery has of course been laced throughout the show.\n\nFrom here we jump to Sasha Lane's C-20 and Slyvie getting their drink on discussing brain freeze. Hilariously Sylvie doesn't suffer from this as we know that Loki is of course a frost giant and therefore wouldn't feel the cold.\n\nThroughout our breakdowns we've discussed how there may be other characters making cameo's as slight variants and in episode 1 it was of course Peggy Carter, Episode 2 had Agatha and shoutouts Christopher Godines on twitter for pointing out we get what might be a cameo of Evan Peter's in this bar.\n\nReality warps around them as we see Sylvie attempt to get to the bottom of how many people are guarding the timekeepers which is revealed to be an illusion.

This is known as Generation Loss and over time if you keep copying something the quality of it diminishes. Obviously, this speaks to the amount of variant Lokis that there are running around and at one point in the entry Loki even refers to Sylvie as a failed Photocopy.\n\nFrom Sylvie travels to the TVA headquarters but she's surprised to learn that her powers don't work meaning that she likely hasn't been there before or if she has that she wasn't in a position to use them. Interestingly though Loki is able to warp his daggers in and this could be because he ended up being placed in a trusted position by the TVA.\n\nNow this power set is very similar to Wanda who too did something similar to people when she infected their mind in age of ultron. This is clearly the skill set of a witch and there are things that hint to her being more of a combination of characters early on.\n\nLoki asks if she's sure she's a Loki, she says not to call her that and at one point he even utters the line Enchant me which....\n\n\nâ–º Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
