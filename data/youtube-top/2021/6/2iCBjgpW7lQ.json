  "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo opens the scoring for Portugal as he and Diogo Jota connect for an easy tap-in. Germany scores twice in a span of three minutes late on in the first half courtesy of own goals from Ruben Dias and Raphael Guerreiro. Kai Havertz adds Germany’s third early on in the second half before Robin Gosens nets a goal of his own. Jota also adds a goal of his own as a late consolation in the second half.\n#ESPNFC #EURO2020 #Portugal #Germany #Ronaldo\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
