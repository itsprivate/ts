Yeah, I can  \n \nMy cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches   \nNo shirt, no shoes, only my features   \nMy boy behind me, he’s taking pictures   \nLead the boys and girls onto the beaches  \nCome one, come all, I’ll tell you my secrets  \nI’m kinda like a prettier Jesus   \n \nForget all of the tears that you’ve cried, it’s over (over, over, over)  \nIt’s a new state of mind — are you coming, my baby?  \n \nAcid green, aquamarine   \nThe girls are dancing in the sand  \nAnd I throw my cellular device in the water  \nCan you reach me? No, you can’t  \n \nTurn it on in a new kind of bright, it’s solar (solar, solar, solar) \nCome on and let the bliss begin \nBlink three times when you feel it kickin’ in  \nThat solar power",
