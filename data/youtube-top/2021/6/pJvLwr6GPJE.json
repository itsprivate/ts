  "description": "It's been nearly two years since @Polo G pulled up to the #LIFTOFF, with Justin Credible and DJ Sourmilk, to rip through his first Leakers freestyle.\n\nReturning to the Power 106 studios, just ahead of the release of his 'Hall Of Fame' album, Polo not only paid homage to the late DMX with bars over \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\", the Chicago native wasted no time delivering non-stop action over the iconic instrumental. \n\nGoing up for nearly two straight minutes, Polo got active spitting, \"The rappers in my city got a choice of either die or move, from the Raq to L.A., to take a L, I refuse.\"\n\n\r\n#PoloG #DMX #RuffRydersAnthem\nSubscribe Now - http://bit.ly/17Rrvxu\r\nPower 106 Website - http://bit.ly/THwnRX \r\nListen Live - http://bit.ly/T0chlq",
