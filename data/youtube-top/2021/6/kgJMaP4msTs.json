Legendary Viking versus legendary King. Raider vs Crusader. Is it Lodbrok or Lothbrok? We couldn't decide. But, we settled on Ragnar Lodbrok. And then we wondered whether it should be titled Richard The Lionheart or Richard I? We plumped for Lionheart. Let's be honest - it sounds more epic! :)\n\nHope you enjoyed the rap battle.
