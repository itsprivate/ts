  "description": "In this episode of Hermitcraft Season 8, Mumbo begins by building an industrial farm on the Hermitcraft server, that is a highly efficient Minecraft villager potato farm producing around 700 potatos per hour. Having been called Potato boy by Grian in Hermitcraft 8: Episode 1, Mumbo embraces that identity by turning himself into a potato. He begins his Hermitcraft shopping district Potato Empire with the 'Potato Boy Tater Vendor' machines that have been installed in many Hermitcraft bases and Hermitcraft neighbourhoods. \n\nFilming channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo2\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialmumbo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatMumboJumbo",
