Ronaldo becomes the first player in European Championship history to score 11 goals in the competition, overtaking Michel Platini’s record of nine. After being held scoreless in the first half, Portugal's three late goals also set a record, with the Selecao becoming the first team in the history of the tournament to score three goals in the final 10 minutes of a match.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
