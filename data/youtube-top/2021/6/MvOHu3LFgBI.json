Floyd Mayweather brought Migos. And I brought Nothing. In this Schlatt Commentary Video, jschlatt talks about stuff including the Logan Paul vs. Mayweather boxing fight in Miami. What a nice place! I love Miami and the entire state of Florida. Maybe one day Schlatt will move to Florida and will wither away in peace in his timeshare. Kids if you want to know what society would be like if Jschlatt, Technoblade, and Fundy get kicked off the Dream SMP, book a ticket to Miami and Dont Come Back.",
