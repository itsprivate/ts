  "description": "Extended Highlights Presented by Bacardi Spiced Rum\n\nIn what may go down as the most exciting game in the rivalry's history, the United States men's national team beat Mexico on Sunday in the Concacaf Nations League final, 3-2 in extra time. The U.S. twice came from behind to draw level with star attacker Christian Pulisic scoring the winning penalty kick in the second half of extra time, but it wasn't over there. Mexico was awarded their own penalty kick on a handball in the box, with backup goalkeeper Ethan Horvath, in the match because of an injury to starter Zack Steffen, denying Andres Guardado to secure the title.\n\nWatch the Condensed Game from USA vs. Mexico, 06/06/2021\r\nHome of Serie A, NWSL, Concacaf Men's and Women's Nations League and World Cup Qualifiers, Argentinaâ€™s Liga Profesional de FÃºtbol, Brazilâ€™s Campeonato BrasileirÃ£o SÃ©rie A and UEFA menâ€™s club competitions including the Europa League, Europa Conference League and... ðŸŽ¶ THE CHAAAMPIONSSS ðŸŽ¶ \n\nWatch every GOLAZO on Paramount+:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/concacaf-nations-league\n\n#Concacaf #NationsLeague #Soccer #CBSSports #Golazo #USMNT #ChristianPulisic #WestonMcKennie #Pulisic",
