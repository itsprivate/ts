  "description": "Get Your BRAND NEW Food Theory Merch NOW! ► https://bit.ly/3vtguU0\n\nRick and Morty has returned with a bang... at least for Morty. He was truly the \"hero\" of this episode while Rick was floundering to meet his usual standards. In the previous season, Rick was too cool to be touched by almost anything going on. In this episode we see him struggle to maintain his usual attitude in the face of his rival, Mr. Nimbus. In the meantime, Morty takes on a much more \"Rick\" like role. Can this be the future of Rick and Morty? \n\nWatch the full episode one FREE on YouTube! ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYCEXg4_lCM\n\nGet yourself some Theory Wear! ► https://bit.ly/3vtguU0\nDon't miss a Film Theory! ► http://bit.ly/1dI8VBH  \n\n#RickandMorty #Rick #Morty #MrNimbus #RickandMortySeason5 #AdultSwim #RickAndMorty Theory #MrPoopyButthole #Theory  #FilmTheory #Matpat    \n\nNeed Royalty Free Music for your Content?
