  "description": "Today camman18 plays not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other Minecraft but challenge like that, but Minecraft short from TikTok camman18! It was HILARIOUS. #camman18​ #shorts​ #tiktok​ #short​ #Minecraft​\n\nI, camman18, answer the question: What's the rarest mob in Minecraft?\n\nSUB TO MY MAIN CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/c/camman18​\n\nThis was likely streamed live on Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/camman18​\n\nJoin my discord - https://discord.com/invite/N4dvJM5​\n\nThis Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.4, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.16.5 in 2021!\n\nThe goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, camman18 from twitch / tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.16.5 and not Minecraft Bedrock.\n\nTHIS IS THE GREATEST CLIP FROM TIKTOK EVER!!!!!",
