  "description": "Ariana Grande - pov (official live performance) | vevo \n\nLet’s talk about Ariana Grande’s voice for a sec. At the start of this Official Live Performance of “pov,” the superstar reveals the strength, depth and emotional clout that her instrument is able to share at any given moment. It’s an extended passage that swoops to unexpected places while remaining centered. “You got more than 20-20 babe/made of glass the way you see through me,” hovers in the air, and then the band sweeps in and everything swells a bit more. But it’s Ari that has established the tone, Ari that’s carrying the ball. It’s masterful in a way, and the lush set design bolsters both the song’s dreamy mood and her fetching fashion statement. Fans know that “pov” is from last year’s ‘Positions’ - a career high point for a  vocalist who has a natural way of totally enchanting her audience. We have other performances coming in this series. Follow our socials and you won’t miss a thing.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “pov” by Ariana Grande.
