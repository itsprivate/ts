  "description": "⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n\nI've been fascinated with Chernobyl since the moment I read about it in history class over 10 years ago. A few months ago I had the opportunity to go explore it after a big snowfall. The stories we heard were both heartbreaking and inspiring.
