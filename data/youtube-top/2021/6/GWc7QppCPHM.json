Im gonna use the Unity game enigine to make it. I've made a few multiplayer games in the past, but nothing on this scale. it's heavily inspired by a bunch of survival multiplayer / roguelike games that i enjoy, like Valheim, Minecraft, Rush, Risk of rain & more. It's pretty scuffed, might get some updates out in the future. thanks for watching :)\n\n//about\nHey! If you're new here, welcome!
