Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person’s speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube. If you have any concerns or want a clip of yours removed, please send an email at GamersReactingYT@gmail.com\n\nRelated Videos to Enjoy\n\nsteveee - villagers will be unhappy xD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgfXMR7aPE\n\nBionic - Minecraft, But There Are Custom Difficulties...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jMmBh-Rjic&t=6s&ab_channel=Bionic\n\nTapL - Minecraft, But Sleeping Gives OP Items...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpneREWXnXY&ab_channel=TapL\n\nMcYum - minecraft parkour be like\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdkE1dIRZFg&t=24s&ab_channel=McYumMcYumVerified",
