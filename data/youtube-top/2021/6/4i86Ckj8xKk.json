  "description": "Halo Infinite's free-to-play multiplayer experience is dynamic, ever-evolving, and arrives later this year on Xbox and PC. Whether you're a returning player ready to check out the Master Chief's new campaign or brand new to the franchise, Halo Infinite builds on the legacy foundations of the series' sandbox-driven gameplay, including Big Team Battle and Arena. Offering something that's equal parts fresh and familiar, with a personalized Spartan journey that's only just beginning at launch - Halo Infinite's multiplayer will deliver continuous content releases, finely tuned combat, unique modes, and community-driven content for years to come.\n\nTechnical previews are coming this summer.
