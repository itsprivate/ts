  "description": "England starts Euro 2020 with a victory for the first time ever thanks to Raheem Sterling's cool finish in the second half against Croatia. The Three Lions nearly took the lead in the first half after Phil Foden's shot struck the post and Kalvin Phillips' struck a venomous volley. Gareth Southgate's side picks up all three points, denying Luka Modric and Croatia from making a comeback with some key defensive plays late in the game.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
