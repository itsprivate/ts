  "description": "My TikTok for you page is completely full of great medical stuff! Today we talk about food like Taco Bell and how it digests through your intestines, the proper volume of your headphones, surgical equipment, getting back in shape, proper skincare, those weird jaw muscle trainers, how to get rid of hickeys with whisks, face masks and skin peeling during periods, sunscreen for babies, concussions, collarbones, melatonin, and yes I even speak some Russian.\n\nI LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!\n-Doctor Mike Varshavski\n\nHelp us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
