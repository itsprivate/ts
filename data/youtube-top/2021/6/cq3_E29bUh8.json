  "description": "Skeppy & BadBoyHalo Guess YouTubers Based on Minecraft Gameplay \nGet Honey for FREE today â–¸ https://joinhoney.com/skeppy \nHoney finds coupons with one click. Thanks to Honey for sponsoring!\n\nToday I got BadBoyHalo to compete with me in one of the HARDEST challenges I think Iâ€™ve done so far. BadBoyHalo and I will battle it out to see who can get the most points and identify which YouTuber we are watching JUST based on context clues. This should be pretty easy when it comes to the speedrunnier Dream but Iâ€™m a little worried about the rest!!! The creators skins and facecamâ€™s will be completely blurred out - lol sorry TapL - and we will have to guess and rack up as many points as possible to defeat the other. If I got anything out of this challenge itâ€™s that I can always recognize a Mr. Beast video no matter what. The points get SO CLOSE HAHA so make sure to stay tuned until the end to see who the real winner is - hint, Iâ€™m actually Quackityâ€™s best friend now. \n\nGet LIMITED TIME Merch here!!!\nhttps://skeppyshop.com/\n\nI Cheated with ONE WAY GLASS in a Building Competition...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiWxNzG5rOw\n\nFollow My Twitter ðŸ¡† @Skeppy\nFollow My Instagram ðŸ¡† @Skeppy\n\nI AM GIVING AWAY $1,000 TO A RANDOM SUBSCRIBER SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED :D\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen but it's BadBoyHalo and I playing the ultimate YouTuber guessing game",
