Drake \"Having Our Way\" Lyrics:\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nLoad up the Drac’\nFuck it, I’m making em pay\nIt’s however niggas wanna take it\nI’m having my way\nSet out here having his way\nQua out here having his way\nAnd like the third Migo I, Take, bitch, what\nLoad up the Drake\nWhat else are they gonna play?\nIt’s however niggas wanna take it\nAy, I’m having my way\nSet out here having his way\nQua out here having his way\nAnd like the third Migo I, Take, what, they, yuh\n\n[Verse: Drake]\nNow that I’m thinking it through\nI just ain’t fell in love ‘cause I’m way too awake\nThen she tried fucking a rapper to break up my heart\nBut my heart doesn’t break\nSoon as I link with these niggas\nThey feelings is written all over they, face\nWait, ok great\nI’m in the back room at Wally’s\nI spent $30,000 on somebody’s grapes\nGetting in so many pull-up’s on niggas\nNo wonder we getting in shape\nToo busy backing my words up with actions\nTo ever go front of your, face\nWhat? Ay, shit done changed\nBillionaires talk to me different\nWhen they see my paystubs from Lucian Grainge\nTold myself that I would get through this verse\nAnd I’m not gonna mention the plane\nBut look at the plane\nFuck what we sayin’\nYeah, what? Fuck what we sayin’\nBig ’81, but I don’t own a Harley\nI ride a Mercedes with Shane\nAy, it’s me an lil’ Harley,\nWe wrecking this shit\nThen we bout to go link with the gang\nAy, and unlike the clock at your momma’s house\nI do not have time to hang\nPlease don’t reach out to me\nThink watching too much of Stefan has got to me\nVerses too easy\nI’m serving ‘em up by the threes\nI’m playing pool\nAnd the pool just connects to the beach\nI’ve been too solid\nTo ever have stripes on my sneak’s\nYou get what I mean?\nBack in the day\nMy dogs was putting they balls\nIn the pockets of all of the fiends\nWhat? What?\nThat was back in the day\nNow we involved in legitimate business\nBaby we came a long way\nSometimes I hop on the road by myself\nAnd I listen to shit that you say\nAll of y’all having more followers than dollars\nAnd that’s why I cannot relate\nNo, what?\nLoad up the Drac’\nFuck it, I’m making em pay\nIt’s however niggas wanna take it\nI’m having my way\nSet out here having his way\nQua out here having his way\nAnd like the third Migo I, Take, bitch, what\nLoad up the Drake\nWhat else are they gonna play?\nIt’s however niggas wanna take it\nAy, I’m having my way\nSet out here having his way\nQua out here having his way\nAnd like the third Migo I, Take, what, they, yuh\n\n[Verse: Quavo]\nLoad up the Drac’ (Drac’)\nMaking them fuck niggas pay\nStraight out the trap to the play (we gone)\nWho said they ain’t having they way? (Who?)\nMight have a lil’ more on they plate (eat it up)\nWe having our way in three ways (whoop)\nOVO scope on the Drake (uh)\nWe having our way (we having that shit)\nHaving my way in the city\nGet pulled out your britches\nYou talking or tripping?\nGo put on my cleats\nSo I’m walking, they slipping (walk)\nHaving my way, now this shit like a business\nLoad up the bases, now I feel like Cal Ripken (ay)\nShe had it her way, now she out of a Bentley (skrrt)\nGet out (mmhmm)\n\n[Verse: Offset]\n(Offset)\nFuck how you take it\nWe straight from the vacant (hey)\nI caught me some cases\nAnd beat it in races (hey)\nSeen they was hating\nNo communication\nNo invitation (no)\nCut of circulation\nBlue or the red Bugatti\nThis the Matrix\nCrosses all over my body\nWatch for Satan (Chrome)\nI’m having, Gallery Lanvin\nNo talking, we smashing (smash)\nThis one a classic\nAin’t none of this average (classic)\nSniper, I’m sniping a bitch\nI’m an assassin (snipe)\nI popped it than piped a bitch up for some action (hey)\nI don’t even be bragging\nThese lil’ niggas maggots (maggots)\nI don’t even flex\nThat shit be on accident\nFell in my lap\nHit your bitch on accident\nI shoot my shot\nAt some point that shit accurate (bow, uh)\n\n[Chorus: Drake & Takeoff]\nLoad up the Drake\nWhat else are they gonna play?
