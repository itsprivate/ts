  "description": "Euro 2020 favorite France is stunned in its Euro 2020 round of 16 clash, as Switzerland wins on penalties to reach the quarterfinals. Haris Seferovic gave Switzerland a surprise lead, before Hugo Lloris prevented France from falling further behind with a penalty save. Karim Benzema struck twice and Paul Pogba curled in an incredible goal from distance to put France 3-1 up, but Switzerland found the net twice in the last ten minutes to force extra time. After no goals in the extra 30 minutes, Kylian Mbappe missed the decisive spot kick to send France home and Switzerland through to the last eight.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
