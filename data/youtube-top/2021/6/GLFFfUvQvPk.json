(please don't actually show the channels just show avengers rolling their eyes or something) I even watched one where they said it could be her and then started using she pronouns for the rest of the video. What the bloody hell is wrong with ya, we're never getting early access again. (show video of someone slapping someone else over the head) All that for a drop of clout (show thanos saying all that for a drop of blood)\n\nAnyway from this point out I'm going in as blind as you guys and Daredevil and the episode has a lot to unpack from it.\n\nNow we open in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in the year 1985 at a renaissance fair.\n\n1985 is the year that Back To The Future was set similar to that film we get an adventure that involves our heroes travelling to the past and future.\n\nI love how they have this idea here of people dressing up like the past in an attempt to relive it. The TVA are literally able to do this and appear at any point in time and there's some really cool easter eggs at this location.\n\nFirstly we can see the Dragonfly armoury which could be a nod to Dragonfly an armoured character from the Marvel Universe.\n\nNext we get what I think is a cameo of Agatha Harkness. Before the big reveal in Wandavision that it was Agatha All Along we noticed that Agnes never really flinched when Wanda performed magic in front of her and this was because stuff like that didn't surprise the character.\n\nThe TVA step out of a temporal doorway in front of her here but rather than being shocked at that she's annoyed that they aren't dressed in traditional medieval attire. Agatha is however and it looks similar in style to what she wore in Salem. Agatha of course was alive during the time period that this festival is celebrating so I think it's hilarious that she's gone to one just to feel more at home.\n\nâ–º Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
