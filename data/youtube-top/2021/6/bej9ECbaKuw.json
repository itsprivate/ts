  "description": "Check out my main channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/NileRed\n\nSodium metal is stored under oil because it's reactive to moisture and air. Most metals are hard, but sodium metal is really soft, and you can squish it, just with your fingers, if you squeeze really hard. Metals are usually shiny, and sodium metal is as well, but because it's so reactive, it quickly tarnishes. But because it's so soft, it can be easily cut with a knife, and on the inside, we can see the nice and shiny metal.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNile talks about lab safety:  https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZAâ€‹\n\n#shorts",
