With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who the singer is behind the mask. The singers may attempt to throw off the crowd, but keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. Each week, a singer is eliminated -- and then reveals his or her true identity.\n\nYou Won't Believe Who's Getting Revealed Tonight! | Season 5 Ep. 1 | THE MASKED SINGER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX\n\n#TheMaskedSinger",
