Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing open up the discussion talking about the sudden loss of friend and former NFL player Vincent Jackson and how he was found days after passing away. \"Did anyone check on him?\" Brandon poses the question which leads him into doing a mental check-in with all the guys. \n\nIn a special moment of vulnerability and raw emotion, the guys are brought to tears as they sit and talk about deep life discussions. The guys talk about how there's a stigma in society that men and young boys are always raised to be tough and not show emotion or the world will look at you differently. With athletes, that notion is instilled by coaches and teammates saying tears are a sign of weakness when in fact it shouldn't be viewed that way. Being strong is part of dealing with emotions and being able to share with others what's truly going on inside your mind and heart. \n\nAfter recently losing his mother Hurricane Paula Johnson, Chad opens up about their relationship and how he's struggled with the emotions tied to loss. Recounting the memories and leading up to her final days, Chad is very transparent that the relationship was unique in many factors but he wouldn't have had it any other way. ‚ÄúIt hurts to lose the person responsible for who I am,‚Äù Chad says, as he breaks down which brings Brandon and Channing to tears too. Fred follows it up saying that sometimes things in life are bigger than sports and different from what people portray on the outside, we all go through things and it's ok to let that emotion out. \n\nAfter a group hug of comfort and reassurance, Chef Nancie comes out and opens up about tragically losing her brother years ago and how the pain never fades but the good memories help make it easier to cope. \n\nI Am Athlete Movie Posters Available now on houseofathlete.com! \n\nSpecial Thanks to Botaniko Weston for providing us a location to film the episode. \n\nFOLLOW US ON:\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/iamathletepodcast\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nWebsite | https://houseofathlete.com\n\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChadJohnson",

The show‚Äôs innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows.

It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by Tom Clancy and a spin-off of the Jack Ryan film series.\n\nThe film tells the origin story of John Kelly (aka John Clark), a U.S. Navy SEAL, who uncovers an international conspiracy while seeking justice for the murder of his pregnant wife by Russian soldiers. When Kelly joins forces with fellow SEAL Karen Greer and shadowy CIA agent Robert Ritter, the mission unwittingly exposes a covert plot that threatens to engulf the U.S. and Russia in an all-out war.\n\nFB: www.facebook.com/WithoutRemorseMovie\nTW: www.twitter.com/WithoutRemorse\nIG: www.instagram.com/WithoutRemorseMovie\n\nAbout Prime Video:\r\nWant to watch it now?

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 3, 2021\nJack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. \"It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this,\" he says.\n\nThis is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in \"WHATS POPPIN.\" That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.\n\nFor this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like \"Same Guy\" and \"Funny Seeing You Here,\" but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rendezvous\"\n\"21C / Delta\"\n\"Funny Seeing You Here\"\n\"Same Guy\"\n\"Creme/ONCE MAY COMES\"\n\"Whats Poppin\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJack Harlow: vocals\nO'Neil \"Doctor O\" Palmer: keys\nRico Nichols: drums\nJoe Cleveland - bass\nRob Gueringer: guitar\nErik B: vocals\nChimera Patrice: vocals\nPorcha Clay: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie Hazzard\nAudio: Nickie Jon Pab√≥n, CJ Blair\nPlayback: Kenny Woods\nBackline: Jonathan Castillo\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",
