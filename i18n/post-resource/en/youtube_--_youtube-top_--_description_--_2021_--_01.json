We‚Äôll be presenting Phish‚Äôs first New Year‚Äôs Eve show from Madison Square Garden ‚Äî 12/31/95 ‚Äî in its entirety, beginning at 8:30 pm ET.\n\nWe‚Äôve teamed up with the fine folks at https://Chess.com to host the Band vs. Audience online chess game which will start right at the top of the show and move at a decent clip. In short, fans will have 5 minutes to move their piece (the band will have no more than that as well). At the end of 5 minutes, whichever move has the most votes is the ‚Äòaudience‚Äô move. Stick around during the set breaks as the band joins in from their various homes, playing a few moves and providing scintillating commentary on the game. We will post and send out the actual game link on 12/31.\n\nTo pace yourself over a long evening, we present some chess cheese board recipes for extended grazing. Our friend Marissa Mullen put together two options ‚Äî ‚ÄúOlive Cheese Dreams‚Äù and ‚ÄúBilly Bries‚Äù ‚Äî with an easy ‚Äòcheese by numbers‚Äô guide. Feel free to swap out any of the ingredients if there‚Äôs something else you prefer. Pair with the bubbly of your choice. For dessert, chessboard cookies! Recipes can be found at https://livephi.sh/chessmenu\n\nFor this final webcast of the year, our beneficiary will be none other than The WaterWheel Foundation itself. Since 1997, the band and their fans have collaborated on a nationwide charitable endeavor by raising funds and donating the proceeds across the country. This year alone, collectively we have raised and donated nearly $750,000 to 27 different nonprofits during the Dinner And A Movie series. Join us in continuing to support those in need.

You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. \n\nFinally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don‚Äôt know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together.

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!\n\nWonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man‚Äôs body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end?

Is it true? And if so: why? I ate a few bagels, and set out to flunk an opioid test.\n\nüëáüëáüëá SOURCES and REFERENCES üëáüëáüëá\nDrug tests don‚Äôt just work as a buzzkill, they can keep doctors and patients honest regarding some of the more dangerous drugs known to man. The problem is, poppy seeds can throw a giant wrench in that circle of trust! Poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum flower native to Turkey, and even though they don‚Äôt contain opium, consuming the seeds has historically caused the tests to register opiate use!\n\nIn this video, I explore how these tests work, what they look for, and how something as simple as a bottle of seeds available at any grocery store, can cause a false positive for painkillers, heroin, morphine, and other drugs.\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica: Poppy Seed\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/poppy-seed\nhttps://www.britannica.com/story/can-eating-poppy-seeds-make-you-fail-a-drug-test \nPoppy seed, tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.\n\nCan Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-nutrition/poppy-seeds-drug-test#bottom-line\nIt‚Äôs possible that even just one bagel or muffin highly loaded with poppy seeds can lead to a positive urine drug test.\n\nLabCorp: Testing Methodology\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/frequently-asked-questions/drug-testing/toxicology/testing-methodology#:~:text=LabCorp%20performs%20initial%20drug%20screening,drug%20present%20in%20urine%20samples. \nQuest Diagnostics: Testing Insights\nhttps://education.questdiagnostics.com/insights/88In \n\nDrugAbuse.gov\nhttps://archives.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/drug-testing-poppy-seeds#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%2020%20years,can%20indeed%20produce%20a%20positive\nDid you know that morphine, codeine, and heroin are produced from the seeds of certain kinds of poppy flowers? Morphine and codeine are often used as medications for treating pain, and all three‚Äîknown as opiates‚Äîcan be abused\n\nSnopes (true!)\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/poppy-seeds-alter-drug-test-results/\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com/creator\nVideo supplied by Getty Images",

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.",
