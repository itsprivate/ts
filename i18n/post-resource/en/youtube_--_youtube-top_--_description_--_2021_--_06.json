I was drivin' Impalas\nWe don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it\nI remember that D2 r–µvolver I bought for my partna\nHe died in a argum–µnt\nThey was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em\n'Member askin' my mom where my father been at\nAin't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at\nNiggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had\nGet them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag\nSay he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can\nHop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band\nI come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand\nTwenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan\nI got horny, almost fucked on a fan\nI had thinked about it, I can't end up on Shade Room\nEverything that I hit, I done paid for\nShe know what I can bring to the table\nI can tell if it's real by the label\nWe had TV, but we didn't have cable\nNow I'm richer than all of my neighbors\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]\nI wear my chain proud, it's a trophy\nI'm with the same crowd, these the brodies\nI don't got the same mind, you don't know me\nYou don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key\nI'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you\nThe Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe\nI shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me\nYou ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Durk]\nBitch, I'm a D-boy, do it for T.Roy\nI'm on you forever, that's just word to V.Roy\nI'm with the killas forever, the trenches is in me\nThe Grammys can't change me for nothin'\nI like the bitches who let me just offer them cash\nYou never gon' ask me for nothin'\nNever gon' switch\nOnly time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button\nRappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'\nThat's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'\n4TF, Only the Family\nBut Four Pockets Full, but we keep it a hundred\nThat shit solid, I done took losses\nI done turned robbers to killers and bosses\nI been that nigga from way, way back\nWay before Uzi was droppin' the cross\nWe just a family, we never recruitin'\nClique full of killas, we choosin' to shoot 'em\nSomeone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script\nAnd just tell 'em to free Larry Hoover\nMe, I'm the voice, Baby, the hero\nTrav like Michael Jackson, yeah\nBeen in it a minute, it's crazy I'm winnin'\nIt only feel like I've been rappin' a year\nLet a nigga play with me, I'm ready\nMy bitch gettin' rich off cosmetics\nLife off, they done freed my daddy\nLights off, I couldn't see my baby\n2010, I had a gun in my Pelle\n2011, I was fightin' my celly\n2012, I signed my deal in Cali\n2021, I'm big as Khaled, oh-woah\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]\nI wear my chain proud, it's a trophy\nI'm with the same crowd, these the brodies\nI don't got the same mind, you don't know me\nYou don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key\nI'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you\nThe Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe\nI shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me\nYou ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\n\n[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Lil Durk]\n(Yeah) After this drop, then it's only a label\nYou see the crosses surroundin' the table\nBut never crosses, we flip ya, alfredo\nBro, do a solid without a potato\nI took the logic and built out a payroll\nAll the whips chocolate, I built it like Legos (Let's go)\nI leave him deceased (Yeah)\n\n....\n\n#LilBaby #LilDurk #HatsOff",

Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person‚Äôs speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube. If you have any concerns or want a clip of yours removed, please send an email at GamersReactingYT@gmail.com\n\nRelated Videos to Enjoy\n\nsteveee - villagers will be unhappy xD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgfXMR7aPE\n\nBionic - Minecraft, But There Are Custom Difficulties...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jMmBh-Rjic&t=6s&ab_channel=Bionic\n\nTapL - Minecraft, But Sleeping Gives OP Items...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpneREWXnXY&ab_channel=TapL\n\nMcYum - minecraft parkour be like\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdkE1dIRZFg&t=24s&ab_channel=McYumMcYumVerified",
