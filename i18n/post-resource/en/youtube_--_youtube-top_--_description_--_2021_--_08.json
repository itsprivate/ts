  "data/youtube-top/2021/8/cnJTNtU2Zuc.json": "Delta Variant is Different - It's the NEW COVID\n\nDelta Variant COVID\nSARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2, is a variant of lineage B.1.617 of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID. It was first detected in India in late 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) named it the Delta variant on 31 May 2021.\n\nWhat‚Äôs different about DELTA Variant Patients? \nThe delta variant is almost like a whole new COVID virus, as it behaves very differently from the previous COVID strains. It has at least three mutations on its spike protein, and more specifically, on its receptor-binding domain. That‚Äôs the part of the spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cells in your body. The delta variant‚Äôs mutations help it bind more efficiently to the ACE2 receptor and allow the virus to enter the cell more easily. Also, its mutations allow it to better evade the body‚Äôs immune system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWant more health tips from me?\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/\n\nWant to increase your energy?\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/more-energy-course/\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTimestamps ‚è©\n00:00 COVID Delta Variant Explained\n00:29 Delta Variant USA Update\n00:39 Is the Delta Variant more Contagious than other Variants?\n01:03 Fully vaccinated people can still spread the delta variant and be infected by it.\n01:56 Does The Delta Variant Make Unvaccinated People More Prone to Dying?\n02:35 COVID Breakthrough Cases\n03:41 Unvaccinated patients regret not getting vaccinated\n05:55 Covid Vaccine Update in the US\n06:45 Vaccine Hesitancy\n07:56 What Hospitals are using to treat covid?\n08:22 Covid Vaccine Infertility\n08:38 Covid Vaccine Pregnancy\n09:09 Medical Exemption of Not Getting COVID Vaccines\n\nThe delta variant has caused COVID cases in the USA to rise over 300% over the past month, along with similar increases in hospitalizations and deaths. The Delta variant is estimated to be at least 60% more transmissible. One CDC document suggests the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox -- with each infected person infecting, on average, 8 or 9 other people. Compare that to the original strain of COVID, which was about as contagious as the common cold, with each infected person infecting two others, on average. \n\nStudies on people infected with delta variant showed that the fully vaccinated had as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people did. That doesn‚Äôt mean worse infection, though, if you‚Äôre vaccinated. But what the significance of those high viral loads leads to the higher transmission of the virus, vaccinated or not. Even if they don‚Äôt have symptoms. It's why the CDC says that even vaccinated people should wear masks in areas of sustained or high transmission. \n\nAlso, a study in China found that the viral loads of people infected with Delta were 1,000 times higher than people infected at the beginning of the pandemic, and delta transmits in four days, compared to six days for the original strain. Three somewhat older studies from Canada, Singapore, and Scotland show that people infected with the Delta variant are more likely to end up in the hospital. \n\nDoes it make unvaccinated people more prone to death compared to the original strain? \nHard to know since there are currently no studies showing that one way or another. It‚Äôs also trickier to answer this question because you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges. You‚Äôre comparing different strains with the original strain; no one was vaccinated in 2020. Also, at the beginning of the covid pandemic, we weren‚Äôt using things like dexamethasone and tocilizumab, two drugs that we now use to treat COVID, because we now know they reduce mortality. With the mRNA vaccines we have, they are about 95% effective at preventing serious COVID illness. So we know that even before the delta covid variant emerged, there will be breakthrough cases. \n\nThe CDC released a study examining an outbreak in Massachusetts where 74% of people who got infected had been fully vaccinated -- and four of them ended up in the hospital. Testing showed that the Delta variant made up 90% of those cases. But overall, still, MOST of the virus is spread by unvaccinated people. The CDC reported a total of 6,587 breakthrough cases, including 6,239 hospitalizations and 1,263 deaths as of July 26. At that time, more than 163 million people in the US were fully vaccinated against Covid.\n\nBut here is pretty impressive. STAT: \nLess than 0.004% of people who have been fully vaccinated experienced breakthrough infections resulting in hospitalization, and less than 0.001% have died from the disease.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#deltavariant #covid #covidvariant",

So, previously we have tested out many a bizarre hack video -- from beauty hacks, to fashion hacks, to photo/video hacks AND soap art hacks -- from Blossom, 5 Minute Crafts, and others -- and in general, I have not been impressed. BUT, a couple of months ago when I stumbled upon these beautiful CANDLE art hacks -- I fell in love. These are the coolest candles I've ever seen and I needed to have them. So we decided to pick out a few key candle art hacks and see if they are just pure clickbait, or if you can actually make any of these crafts IRL. We tried a margarita jelly candle hack, a whipped wax latte candle hack, and a wax cherry blossom tree hack. What do you guys think of our final products??\n\nWhat do you guys think of these soap hacks??\n\nYou can check out the Blossom videos that contain our hacks here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25tCwqjnjro\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZNGuk5wMR8\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/‚Äã\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington",

The singer‚Äôs desire to develop rich musical and visual environments for her fans is job one, and this new album, her third after ‚ÄòAmala‚Äô and ‚ÄòHot Pink,‚Äô is her most fully-realized statement yet. Doja has told interviewers that she wanted to take chances, try new approaches, and create ‚Äúotherworldly‚Äù sounds. Job done. The same goes for our series of Official Live Performances. After sharing creative ideas with the singer and her team, our production crew got to work in a canyon outside of LA. There, assuring that ‚Äúotherworldly‚Äù request was appropriately fleshed out, we built a 48‚Äô stage in the center of a rocky crag. Doja, banking on a combo of skills, artistry, and perseverance, did the rest. We've already presented \"Love To Dream\" and \"Ain't Shit.\" Now comes the carnal coolness of \"Need To Know.\" Doja shows us her boss side as she drives all the action in this steamy bedroom rumination, and her lithe Cali desert performance makes it all pop.\n\nWatch music videos by Doja Cat: http://bit.ly/3azELOl\n\nDoja Cat\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DojaCat\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dojacat/\nhttp://www.dojacat.com/\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\n\nCreative Director: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham \nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nDirected By: Kyle Goldberg\nProducer: Madeline Schmidt\nProducer: Cole Brian \nProducer: Haley Sliger\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro & Jordan Ferree \nProduced By: Contrast Films\nDirector Of Photography: Franklin Ricart\nProduction Design: Wes Dogan \nDesign: Sydney Emery\nDesign: Dominique Falcone\nDesign: Keith Wright\nEditor : Kevin Rose\nVisual Effects: Sean Joseph \nColor: Justin Roberts\n\n#DojaCat  #DojaCatLive  #NeedToKnow\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/ihFhDn",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/8/R7au22YFdmw.json": "There are many weapons in Fallout 3. Some are cobbled together by the average wastelander who‚Äôs just trying to get by. Some are hand crafted with hate to kill a loved one. But only one weapon is fancy enough to have a title in its name. Can You Beat Fallout 3 With Only The Miss Launcher?\n\nMitten Squad Discord link: http://www.Mitten.Land/\n\nCheck out some of my other videos if you liked this one:\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas With A Big Iron On Your Hip?: https://youtu.be/K_x9akvgc40\nCan you Beat Fallout: New Vegas By Killing Everyone?:  https://youtu.be/7mCJBotRYeg\nCan you Beat Fallout: New Vegas Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/BlMwqo4rAHg\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas As A Necromancer?: https://youtu.be/kfQ6GNKqLOs\nCan You Beat Fallout 4 Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/k0GamZYQwvA\nCan You Beat Fallout 3 Without Moving The Camera?: https://youtu.be/kUpwvr4YlD4\nCan You Beat Skyrim With Only A Fork?: https://youtu.be/pBVBrUXGpWk\nCan You Beat Fallout 3 As A Baby?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HLHqINNuM8\n\n Can You Beat Fallout 3 With Only The Miss Launcher? (in text form)\n\nUp first, just like in rehearsal, was my birth. Then Todd welcomed the lovely Paulina in the world, my mother flatlined, and the next thing I knew I was alive. Believe it or not, Explosives will be worthless because the miss Launcher is a variation of the missile launcher and the missile launcher family of weapons are in the Big Guns side of the tree while grenades and throwable explosives are on the Explosives side. That makes the SPECIAL setup for this challenge kind of a pain in the ass. There‚Äôs only 1 place to find the Miss Launcher and its locked behind a 75 lockpick door. And if you haven‚Äôt noticed yet, I‚Äôm playing on console for a reason I‚Äôll get to in a second so I can‚Äôt quick save quick load through the door. Intelligence is a necessity for getting skill points when leveling up. Endurance is for Big Guns and to hopefully grow into an emotionless bullet sponge later in life. Charisma has to be at 4 to get the Child at Heart perk, of course Luck is a social influencer that affects all skills, the rest don‚Äôt matter. I made my HUD orange just like the default New Vegas color, hated it instantly but refused to change it back, and before I knew what hit me it I was 10 years old. \n\nCan you believe it? A surprise party all for me. Music, balloons, a floating clown. I had a great time until it was time to go kill the bug. In an effort to cause as many uncomfortable situations as possible, I stuck coffee mugs in everyones pockets thinking if I got the entire vault to hate me someone with a weapon would bash me over the skull with a party hat. When that didn‚Äôt work, I settled for executing the roach, pumped BB‚Äôs in the gaping hole where dads heart was before I destroyed it. With my father having just been pelted into unconsciousness, Jonas told me to think about how much fun a child could have with a gun, got a fantastic birthday picture, dad checked me for lice, and started picking skills. There‚Äôs more to this than meets the eye. My skills were Big Big guns, Barter, and Sneak. You should be concerned that the challenge involved a missile launcher and I‚Äôve chosen to sneak. \n\n3 years later, it‚Äôs the end of the world. The rad roaches I mourned in another life ripped Officer Kendall‚Äôs leg off and were moments away from eating Butch‚Äôs mother when I failed to convince him to leave her behind. In the Atrium I alerted the guards to my presence to save the lives of two innocent vault dwellers. Not sure where they went. One second they were about to make a run for it then they were gone. Also not sure why there were so many roaches. I didn‚Äôt question it. My dream of pretending to command an army of radroaches had become a reality. The only man they weren‚Äôt willing to assault was the Overseer. The vault doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, we‚Äôve got a wasteland to save.",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/8/W1RNbUaCKHA.json": "Since Jones' betrayal to the I.O one thing is clear. He wasn't working alone. https://fn.gg/Impostors\n\nWill you ensure the safety and security of The Bridge... or follow Jones‚Äô footsteps and sabotage the Imagined Order from within? Discover your role in Fortnite Impostors.\nFortnite Impostors is a mode for a maximum of ten players: eight Agents maintaining The Bridge and two Impostors out to overtake it. Let‚Äôs take a look at how these roles play out.\n\n\nThe facilities powering The Bridge are a well-oiled machine, and it's up to Agents of the Imagined Order to keep it that way. Complete Assignments like calibrating chests and llamas, repairing the Battle Bus, and delivering Storm reports for analysis. Finish your Assignments quickly and be on the lookout for dubious Impostors or eliminated allies. Complete all Assignments or vote out all Impostors and claim victory for IO. \n\nWork together to root out anyone masquerading as a fellow Agent, but trust nobody completely ‚Äî anyone could be an Impostor. If you find a fellow Agent‚Äôs eliminated fragment, report it! Everyone will be teleported to The Bridge where you can inform Agents who you suspect might have betrayed the IO and vote them out.\n\nThe Impostors‚Äô goal is simple ‚Äî eliminate enough Agents to take control of The Bridge before being discovered. You‚Äôll have plenty of tools up your sleeve to sow chaos along the way. \n\nDisable Assignments - Temporarily freeze progress on all Assignments, buying you precious time.\nTeleport Players - Relocate all Agents and Impostors to somewhere else on The Bridge, covering your tracks.\nPeely Party - For a short time, all Agents and Impostors look like Peely so you can blend in with the crowd!\n\nLike Agents, Impostors will have a list of Assignments they can complete to earn everyone‚Äôs trust. Be cautious, though: for every Assignment you finish, you inch the Agents closer to their completion goal. \n\nPlayers can queue up with any party size and any remaining slots will be filled. To keep gameplay fair and fun, public voice chat is disabled in Impostors but you can still talk in party chat; use Emotes and the Quick Chat menu to communicate with all players.\n\nOnly want to play with your group of friends? Select the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù option when queuing into Impostors and as few as four players in your party can launch into their own custom game, though for the best experience we suggest 10 players. Starting a game with four to seven total players will only have one Impostor, while eight or more will have two Impostors. Also, you can change your party settings by selecting the Gear icon in your Friends list to:\n\nlimit others from joining your party to just people you invite (Private).\nlimit your party to your friends, and their friends can join without invite (Friends Only). Let anyone join your party (Public).\n\nSometimes you‚Äôll need to Force a Discussion to check in on fellow Agents and discuss the Impostor infiltration. Discussions can be called by finding an eliminated Agent and reporting it or by interacting with the Discussion panel in The Bridge‚Äôs center room. During discussions, Agents and Impostors can share information with each other via Emotes and a brand-new Quick Chat menu, asking contextual questions about who was doing what and accusing suspicious candidates for ejection. \n\nAt the end of each Discussion, Agents and Impostors will vote to either eject someone from The Bridge or to skip their vote for that Discussion. Consider others‚Äô accusations and objections carefully: if the person voted out was actually an Agent, then Impostors are one step closer to eliminating everyone. Sometimes not voting is the best option. \n\nThe Bridge is the nexus of the Imagined Order‚Äôs power. With danger around every corner and the facility under constant threat ‚Äî trust nobody. \n\n\nThe fate of The Bridge is in your hands. Check out Fortnite Impostors, and for a limited time, join the Fortnite Impostors Trials for a chance to unlock a special Spray, Emoticon, and Wrap!\n\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode.

This includes that the Eternals were created by the Celestials in order to hunt predators known as the deviants.\n\nAccording to what they said, the Deviants basically feasted on newly formed evolving worlds that had a sudden burst in life and this explains why they show up after the snap.\n\nWe learn this from Ajak played by Salma Hayek who we open the trailer on. From the first trailer we know that the Eternals came to Earth millenia ago and that they helped us to evolve. Though this trailer doesn't confirm it it's likely that they travelled here in order to fight the deviants and after they decided to rest and look after us because we're so adorable aren't we. Got our wars but we got our memes as well.\n\nThis was heavily shown in the first trailer and though they spent centuries together I think it's safe to say that they decided to split up and live apart on the planet.\n\nHowever the threat of the deviants return brings them together and thus they have to team up once more. Now interestingly we don't see Ajak in any more present day scenes in the trailer.\n\nEverytime she shows up it seems to be in a flashback or a scene set in an earlier part of the timeline. This could mean that Ikarus kills her and later on in the trailer we see him at the location firing his eye lasers.\n\nI actually have a theory that Ikarus is bad and that he's angered over falling out of love with Sersi played by Gemma Chan. In the first look the pair were together for a long time but then they split up and it is rumoured that Sersi will now be dating Dane Whitman played by Kit Harrington.\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n‚Ä¢ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n‚Ä¢ DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n‚Ä¢ Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com",

From humble origins as a Neolithic tribe, transition to the Ancient Era as the Babylonians, become the Classical era Mayans, the Medieval Umayyads, the Early Modern era British, and so on. Each culture will add its own special gameplay layer, leading to near-endless outcomes.\n\nMORE THAN HISTORY, IT‚ÄôS YOUR STORY\n\nFace historical events, take impactful moral decisions, and make scientific breakthroughs. Discover the natural wonders of the world or build the most remarkable creations of humankind. Each game element is historically authentic. Combine them to build your own vision of the world.\n\nLEAVE YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD\n\nThe journey matters more than destination. Fame is a new and unifying victory condition. Every great deed you accomplish, every moral choice you make, every battle won will build your fame and leave a lasting impact on the world. The player with the most fame will win the game. Will you be the one to leave the deepest mark on the world?\n\nMASTER TACTICAL BATTLES ON LAND, SEA & AIR\n\nEach battle in HUMANKIND‚Ñ¢ plays out like a mini turn-based board game on top of the actual world map. Unstack your armies and command each of your units, including the emblematic units of your culture and their special abilities. Construct siege weapons to besiege and occupy cities. Fight in large battles spanning multiple turns, and don‚Äôt hesitate to bring in reinforcements!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LEADER\n\nIn HUMANKIND‚Ñ¢, you‚Äôll be playing the leader of your society as an avatar that you create and customize! Your avatar will evolve visually over the course of the game as your civilization develops. You‚Äôll also be able to level up your leader via a meta-progression system to unlock custom looks that you can showoff to strangers and friends alike in multiplayer matches up to 8 players.\n\nHOW FAR WILL YOU PUSH HUMANKIND?",

On the front cover it reads Peter Parker & His Spider-Minions with him puppeting people showing that the media is still sort of trashing him even though he saved the city and universe.\n\nGonna put some dirt in their eyes. It also shows that those around him have been pulled into this too which we'll talk about later on in the video.\n\nMJ reads one of the passages out about how some suggest Parker's powers include the ability to hypnotise females. Whilst this is thrown away as a little joke it actually foreshadows the big reveal in the trailer in which Peter asks Strange to pretty much hypnotise the entire world into forgetting he's Spider-man.\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n‚Ä¢ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n‚Ä¢ DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n‚Ä¢ Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com",

But Mr. Stockton suggests that unless government upholds its duty to protect Americans, keeping the common good in mind, this may be a battle with no end.\n\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.
