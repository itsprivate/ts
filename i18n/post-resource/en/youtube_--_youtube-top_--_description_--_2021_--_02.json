  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/_zZ7fIkpBgs.json": "As early as Tuesday, February 2, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 9 (SN9) ‚Äì the second high-altitude suborbital flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 8 (SN8), SN9 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN9 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.\n  \nThe Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN9‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. \n\nA controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  \n\nGiven the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs second high-altitude flight test of Starship!",

The Show is rumored to feature Mephisto, Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more. Every week we will be doing Wandavision breakdowns, easter egg videos, theories and ending explaineds so definitely stick around. We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\n0:00 Episode 5 Intro\n0:34 Avengers Endgame Post Credits Scene\n1:22 Vision And The Scarlett Witch Graphic Novel\n2:04 Agnes Theories And Clues\n3:34 Episode 5 Sitcom Influences\n5:03 Wandavision Episode 5 Breakdown\n18:04 Wandavision Episode 6 Spoilers And Leaks\n\nOk so Episode 4 ended with us finding out that Scarlett Witch was doing a weekend at Wanda's with Visions dead corpse. It was a mindblowing moment that set her up as the big bad but throughout the season there's been several clues that something more sinister is going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but as always Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who Jimmy Woos you with my card tricks now let's get into the biggidy biggidy breakdown.\n\nNow as always things are time coded below if you wanna skip ahead but as is usual with our breakdowns we're gonna be discussing some key theories up top.\n\nIf you've been keeping up to date with the behind the scenes stuff on the show then you'll know that the showrunner Jac Schaeffer revealed that Wandavision actually takes place almost immediately after Endgame and before the events of Far From Home.\n\nIf you checked out our video last week then you'll has seen us discussing an interview with Paul Bettany in which he revealed that Endgame originally had a post credits scene that set up the events of the show. It was supposed to close out with Wanda going to see Vision's body which was being kept in a drawer and we can see why this was cut as it happens at one point in the episode.\n\nVision actually didn't want to be brought back to life but Wanda doing this shows that she has completely broken his trust.\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n‚Ä¢ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n‚Ä¢ DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n‚Ä¢ Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
