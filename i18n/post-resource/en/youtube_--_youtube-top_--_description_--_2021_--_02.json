Among them are Amalia True (Laura Donnelly), a mysterious, quick-fisted widow, and Penance Adair (Ann Skelly), a brilliant young inventor. They are the champions of this new underclass, making a home for the Touched, while fighting the forces of… well, pretty much all the forces — to make room for those whom history as we know it has no place. #HBO #TheNevers\nSubscribe to HBO on YouTube: https://goo.gl/wtFYd7\n\nStream on HBO Max: http://itsh.bo/hbo-max\n\nGet More HBO\nOfficial Site: https://itsh.bo/dotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hbo\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hbo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hbo\n\nThe Nevers: Official Teaser | HBO",
  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/_zZ7fIkpBgs.json": "As early as Tuesday, February 2, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 9 (SN9) – the second high-altitude suborbital flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 8 (SN8), SN9 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN9 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.\n  \nThe Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN9’s Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. \n\nA controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  \n\nGiven the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX’s second high-altitude flight test of Starship!",

Towers, por su parte, ya habría colaborado con Rochy en el remix del hit “La Máxima”.\n\nLa protagonista del videoclip oficial del remix de “Ella no es tuya” es la popular Instagramer Alexandra Hatcu, siendo esta la primera aparición de la modelo en un audiovisual del género urbano. \n\nLa producción del tema se realizó bajo la colaboración entre las disqueras Vulcano Music Entertainment con Sony Music Latin. \n\nLa versión original de “Ella no es tuya” acaba de convertirse en disco de oro en Estados Unidos y ya cuenta con 3 millones de reproducciones en la plataforma de música digital Spotify y su videoclip sobrepasa los 40 millones de reproducciones en Youtube. \n\nRochy RD manifestó: “El tema se convirtió en un éxito porque mucha gente de las redes sociales lo dedican a manera de broma a todos aquellos hombres que creían que su pareja era exclusiva de ellos, y no era así, por eso nadie duda que al tema le queda mucho tiempo de vigencia”, concluyó. \n\nGratitud\n\nEl rapero nativo del barrio Los Frailes, en agradecimiento a Vulcano Music, disquera dirigida por JC Restituyo (Aka Creador), se tatuó el logo de la compañía por haber confiado en su talento y guiarlo dentro de la creciente industria musical tanto nacional como internacionalmente.",

The hosts went in front with goals from Robert Kenedy and Roberto Soldado. Barca left its comeback late with goals in the 88th minute and stoppage time from Antoine Griezmann and Jordi Alba. The game went to extra time where the two sides traded goals from Griezmann and Fede Vico, but in the second extra time period Alba and Frenkie de Jong seal the victory for the Blaugrana. Barcelona advances to the Copa del Rey semifinals for the 10th time in the last 11 seasons, with its only elimination before the semis coming last season.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",

The Show is rumored to feature Mephisto, Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more. Every week we will be doing Wandavision breakdowns, easter egg videos, theories and ending explaineds so definitely stick around. We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\n0:00 Episode 5 Intro\n0:34 Avengers Endgame Post Credits Scene\n1:22 Vision And The Scarlett Witch Graphic Novel\n2:04 Agnes Theories And Clues\n3:34 Episode 5 Sitcom Influences\n5:03 Wandavision Episode 5 Breakdown\n18:04 Wandavision Episode 6 Spoilers And Leaks\n\nOk so Episode 4 ended with us finding out that Scarlett Witch was doing a weekend at Wanda's with Visions dead corpse. It was a mindblowing moment that set her up as the big bad but throughout the season there's been several clues that something more sinister is going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but as always Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who Jimmy Woos you with my card tricks now let's get into the biggidy biggidy breakdown.\n\nNow as always things are time coded below if you wanna skip ahead but as is usual with our breakdowns we're gonna be discussing some key theories up top.\n\nIf you've been keeping up to date with the behind the scenes stuff on the show then you'll know that the showrunner Jac Schaeffer revealed that Wandavision actually takes place almost immediately after Endgame and before the events of Far From Home.\n\nIf you checked out our video last week then you'll has seen us discussing an interview with Paul Bettany in which he revealed that Endgame originally had a post credits scene that set up the events of the show. It was supposed to close out with Wanda going to see Vision's body which was being kept in a drawer and we can see why this was cut as it happens at one point in the episode.\n\nVision actually didn't want to be brought back to life but Wanda doing this shows that she has completely broken his trust.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n► Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

What hidden details in Pietro's cameo begin to explain what's really going on with this apparent X-Men crossover? Erik Voss breaks down all the Easter Eggs you missed, including the mysterious red glow throughout the episode, Monica Rambeau's interesting history with Captain Marvel, a possible Fantastic Four reference, the even-darker backstory behind Sparky the dog, and what this episode tells us about other X-Men like Magneto, Professor X, Wolverine, or Deadpool appearing in the MCU.\n\nNew Rockstars supports efforts to end racial violence.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/dh3MiwuLntA.json": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.\n\nNPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.\n\n\"Just bear with me while I just enjoy this and soak in it,\" GIVĒON admits with a laugh. Switching between the demeanors of a seasoned, nonchalant crooner and a giddy-grinned newbie, the fast-rising R&B star makes a point to show his humility during his long-awaited debut at Tiny Desk.\n\nAccompanied by a minimal, masked-up band and only one background vocalist (a fellow Pisces at that), the baby-face baritone fills the set with resonance and light. He radiates gratitude with every note. Against a blue, moody backsplash of projected music video stills, GIVĒON notes the divine timing of this performance. \"Any moment to do this would be special,\" he says between songs, \"but I think Black History Month ... just celebrating Black culture for this month, I'm really excited to get to do this on this platform.\"\n\nThrough the throes of the pandemic, GIVĒON has remained remarkably busy. In a span of eight months, the Long Beach, Calif. newcomer has released two solid EPs, the Grammy-nominated Take Time and When It's All Said And Done. (The latter included one of our favorite songs of 2020, \"Still Your Best.\") For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he borrows from each project to arrange a tantalizing 14-minute sampler — showing off just enough to get you to do your Googles and discover more.\n\nMuch like the moment he's trying to savor, GIVĒON's strength as a singer-songwriter is his ability to make his listener feel suspended in time. As fans quickly discovered on his breakthrough \"Chicago Freestyle\" feature last year, the peaks and valleys of GIVĒON's tone and the satisfying patterns of his runs don't just serenade; They immerse, they engulf. GIVĒON's star rising during a time of such sustained uncertainty is no accident, either. Between vulnerable storytelling and clear vocals, GIVĒON's work provides so many with what they're craving right now: intimacy and consistency.\n\nSET LIST\n\"THE BEACH\"\n\"LIKE I WANT YOU\"\n\"Stuck On You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGIVĒON: vocals\nDeondre Ellis: keys\nIvan Chatman: bass\nAndre Montgomery: drums\nJames Murray: guitar\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jan Lim, Mitchell Schultz, Will Houlihan\nProducer: Zack Warren\nDirector: Eric Longden\nAudio: Jeremy Gray, Reggie Jones, Al Richardson\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",
