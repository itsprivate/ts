If you were a millionaire no it\nmost probably wasnt hard for you. If you were from a abusive family and are\nstill studying/underage then yes for you it was hard.

But it's not possible to stop people from\ndoing it and hence my view.\n\nI feel this way due to how much control a person has over certain aspects of\ntheir body. A person has very minimal…",

Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan,\nall of these were failed wars. People in charge knew they were & didn't want to\nend them for various political reasons. We can see how bad the…",
  "data/reddit-changemyview/r/changemyview/comments/pfw3f1/cmv_there_is_no_point_in_telling_kids_that_there.json": "By \"kid\" I mean someone under the age of about 8.\n\nWe hear a lot of parents saying to their kids \"There's no such thing as boy\ncolours and girl colours.\"\n\nAnd I would be inclined to agree.
