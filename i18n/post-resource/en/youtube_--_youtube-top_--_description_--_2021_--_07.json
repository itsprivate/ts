Speaking exclusively to TODAY, Richardson cites the pressure of athletic competition, her biological mother’s recent death and more, but says, “I know what I did, I know what I’m allowed to do … and I still made that decision.” Regarding the chance that she could still participate in a relay event, she says, “If I’m allowed to receive that blessing, then I’m grateful for it, but right now, I’m going to just focus on myself.” She says: “I’d like to say to my fans and my family and my sponsorship … I apologize,” adding, “Don’t judge me: I’m human. I just happen to run a little faster.” She adds: “I still have games in me … I’ll be back and ready to compete.”\n\n» Subscribe to TODAY: http://on.today.com/SubscribeToTODAY\n» Watch the latest from TODAY: http://bit.ly/LatestTODAY\n\nAbout: TODAY brings you the latest headlines and expert tips on money, health and parenting.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/7/r2XJ9P1NvJc.json": "Ariana Grande ft. Ty Dolla $ign - safety net (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nFor a singer, being able to set a mood is like being able to cast a spell. Time and again Ariana Grande has proven she's one of those vocalists who can architect an aura, and this performance of \"safety net\" is a great example of the way she controls the emotional climate of a song. The lyrics describe the feeling of being lost in love - a little bit over your head in a new relationship. By inviting Ty Dolla $ign along for a very smooth exchange of lines, Ari takes on an arranger's duties. She knows exactly how she wants this one to sound. \"safety net\" is from 'Positions,' of course. Like our previous Official Live Performance of \"pov,\" it puts her voice right up front, exactly where it should be. Deftly designing the use of swoops and trills, she again shows us her mastery of modern pop. Stay tuned, more coming.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “safety net” by Ariana Grande.

This video is about the time I had appendicitis and was sent to the hospital where I got emergency surgery. This video actually had a due date (today) for the sponsor so there was a couple things that got left out of the story, they were tiny details but it was things like my friends came to visit me after my surgery and it was really nice! It meant a lot more than I expected it to. My friends were the real stars here and I don't think I did them real justice tbh so maybe another day I'll do a retelling of the story, podcast style or something. I might take a break from sponsors for a video or 2 so I don't run into this problem again. Also I'm getting worried the sponsorship reads are just funnier than the actual video lol.\n\n\nBut yeah the appendicitis thing. It was terrible. Especially getting sick all over the place. I remember that doctor looking at me and being like \"you need to stick this tube in your stomach\" and I was thinking I wasn't ready but didn't really have a choice. There was no room for push back it was all or nothing. It was a little freaky but I think I'm so lucky to have my friends in my life to support me. They were there to bring me to the hospital, support me emotionally, take care of my belongings when I abandoned them in the classroom.\n\n\nAlso I learned a lot about the hospitalization process. It's pretty fast like I was just given a room right away. One moment I was given an assessment and the next I was given a patient robe to put on, I hardly had time to think!\n\n\nTIME TO GET TO WORK ON THE NEXT VIDEO!\n\n\n\nthank you for watching ❤️\n\n(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)\n📱 twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\n📷 instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/\n\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
