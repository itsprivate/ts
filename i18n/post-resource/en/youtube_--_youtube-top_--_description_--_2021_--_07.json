Speaking exclusively to TODAY, Richardson cites the pressure of athletic competition, her biological mother’s recent death and more, but says, “I know what I did, I know what I’m allowed to do … and I still made that decision.” Regarding the chance that she could still participate in a relay event, she says, “If I’m allowed to receive that blessing, then I’m grateful for it, but right now, I’m going to just focus on myself.” She says: “I’d like to say to my fans and my family and my sponsorship … I apologize,” adding, “Don’t judge me: I’m human. I just happen to run a little faster.” She adds: “I still have games in me … I’ll be back and ready to compete.”\n\n» Subscribe to TODAY: http://on.today.com/SubscribeToTODAY\n» Watch the latest from TODAY: http://bit.ly/LatestTODAY\n\nAbout: TODAY brings you the latest headlines and expert tips on money, health and parenting.
